History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer


Social History:
Social History: Pt is widowed. She has no children. She
currently lives in a nursing home. Has been there since '[**65**]? She
has no hx of smoking, EtOH, IVDU. Will call sister tomorrow for
more information.

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GBS meningitis/bactermia
In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on
Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. The following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs,
FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1
additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat
LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. Pneumonia:
Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent
for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin
for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course)
and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).
.
4. Supraglottic edema
As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was
taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she
will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. Multiple sclerosis
Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP,
seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg
qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. Mental status
At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and
recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule
out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was
finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. Respiratory status
After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit,
then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. HTN
In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of
hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed.
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed
a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

[**2179-5-24**] and taken to the Operating Room for L2-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach.

# Lumbar spondylosis, scoliosis, and stenosis.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pneumoboots
were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous
antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the
operating room for a scheduled L2-S1 decompression with PSIF as
part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The second surgery was also
without complication and the patient was transferred to the
T/SICU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25 and she
was given 2 units PRBCs.  She was maintained on strict supine
bedrest for 48 hours given the small dural tear that was noted.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3
from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate.

#) Delirium:
During her post-operative course, the patient was noted to be
confused and disoriented, prompting transfer to medicine for
further management of her delirium.  This was felt to be
possibly as secondary to narcotic medication and lingering
effects of anesthesia.  Infectious etiologies were ruled out and
the patient underwent an ABG which did not reveal evidence of
hypoventilation.  Her mental status improved significantly and
she was awake, alert, oriented x3 and long longer confused prior
to discharge.

#) Pain control:
The patient was intially maintained on a fentanyl PCA and this
was transitioned to oral pain medications with good control
prior to discharge.  She was followed by the chronic pain
service given her history of multiple medication allergies.  She
is to be discharged on tramadol, topiramate, and aceaminophen.

#) Anemia
Patient's baselined hematocrit was felt to be approximately 40
(from [**2179-4-24**]).  She required PRBC transfusions given
intraoperative blood [**Last Name (un) 940**].  Her hematocrit remained stable upon
discharge (28-29).

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo WF with a PMHx of advanced [**1-27**] progressive MS,
chronic indwelling foley, h/o pe on coumadin who p/f personal
care home with AMS
.
The patient's last admission was [**2196-5-22**] who was admitted for
AMS and acute on chronic lethargy.  They dx her with toxic
metabolic encephalopathy [**1-27**] to UTI and mrsa follicullitis (she
had a dermatomal rash).  She was treated with vancomycin, she
improved was transitioned to orals bactrim and doxycycline and
was d/c.
.
The following history was obtained from an LPN named [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 3073**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3074**].  She states that since the patient
prior admission she never returned to her baseline.  The patient
seems to have a waxing and wanning mental status.  She denies
seeing the patient have twitching movements or signs of
infection such as recent diarrhea, fever or cough.  Temps at [**Hospital1 1501**]
ranged from 99.2-99.4.  The patient recently history is notable
for non-compliance both when she is oriented and when she is
not.  She refuses UA evalaution and also refuses suprapubic
care.  It is not clear when the last time her supr-pubic cath
was changed.  Starting the day of admission, the patient was
incoherent, was unable to swallow her pills and was salivating.
she was deemed usafe to be at her home and was sent to the ED
and [**Hospital1 **].
.
The patient arrived to the ED and was intially minimally
responsive.  Per the ED reports she improved while there from a
MS perspective.  They did an I and D of the area around her SP
cath and it was sent for culture which showed GPC in  pairs and
GPR.  BC and Urine cultures were sent.  The patient HCT showed
nothing acute and her CXR was wnl.  The patient was given
levofloxacin and sent to the floor.

Focal spongiosis, focal follicular neutrophilic parakeratosis,
sparse superficial perivascular dermatitis with rare
eosinophils, and mild papillary dermal edema.  The changes are
mild and non-specific.  The finding of neutrophilic
parakeratosis at a follicular ostium (slide L1-2) is suggestive
of seborrheic dermatitis.  While the anatomic site is somewhat
unusual, a seborrheic dermatitis-like drug eruption is possible.
 Seborrheic dermatitis may occur more frequently with some
medical disorders including epilepsy.  PAS stain is negative for
fungi.  Clinical-pathologic correlation is recommended.

Imaging:
CXR [**7-9**]: A single portable chest radiograph is obtained. There
has been no significant interval change in comparison to prior
study from [**2196-5-18**].  No focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax is seen. The heart and mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. No soft tissue or bony abnormalities noted.
Biapical pleural thickening is stable.

Non-contrast Head CT [**7-9**]: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial
infarct. Hypoattenuation in the subcortical and periventricular
white matter is mild and unchanged, likely sequelae of chronic
microvascular ischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and symmetric in configuration. There is no shift
from normally midline structures. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear with interval resolution
of the right sphenoid sinus air-fluid level. No osseous
abnormality is identified.

MRI Head w/&w/o contrast [**7-14**]:
1. No evidence of acute findings.
2. Stable white matter lesions consistent with patient history
of Multiple
Sclerosis.
3. Incompletely visualized atrophy of the spinal cord.
4. Opacification of the mastoid air cells.
.
EEG [**7-10**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of initially continuous generalized electrographic seizures
consistent
with non-convulsive status epilepticus. Over the course of the
recording, these frequent seizures subsided with antiseizure
medication
administration. There was a transition from frequent
electrographic
seizures to infrequent bifrontal epileptiform discharges at
around 22:00
hours. There was no recurrence of electrographic seizures for
the
remainder of the study duration. Background activity remained
slowing,
indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.

EEG [**7-21**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of frequent rhythmic bifrontal epileptiform discharges occurring

intermittently throughout the recording. The background rhythm
was
diffusely slow indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Compared to the prior days recording there were
periodic
epileptiform discharges which did not evolve into electrographic

seizures.

EEG [**7-27**]: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study
due
to several electrographic seizures in the frontal central region
more
predominant on the right associated with clinical jerking of the

shoulders and occasionally gagging. Also, the background showed
a
generalized delta slowing consistent with a diffuse
encephalopathic
process with a non-specific etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 53 yo WF with a PMHx of severe MS, MRSA folliculitis, c.
diff who p/f [**Hospital1 1501**] with AMS c/w delerium picture who is also found
to be hyponatremic (Na-122) with a dirty UA from a PB catheder
with labs significant for leukopenia and hypothermia.
.
In the ED the patient received a dose of levofloxacin, had a
negative HCT, got a preliminary laboratory w/u and was sent to
the floor.
.
Upon arrival the patient was able to follow simple commands and
would participate in strength testing.  She was mostly non
verbal only speaking [**12-27**] word phrases that were mostly non
sensical.  She was unable to relate any history.  As a result
the patient [**Hospital1 1501**] and medical power of attorney were called.  The
patient has a fairly highly functioning individual who was
verbal and able to ambulate with assistance several monthly ago,
according to the medical power of attorney, Mrs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was then admitted for a similar episode of AMS which
was attributed to toxic metabolic encephalopathy at that time.
She was then discharged and since that time has never been back
to her baseline.  According to the nursing home she would have
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS and was non compliant with care.
.
The patient was free water restricted as it was reported that
the patient consumed up to 3L of free water a day.  She was
started on vanco/levoquin for her SIRS.  The patient sodiums
were monitored overnight and fluids were restarted on her to
help correct her hyponatremia.  Neurology was consulted and they
did not have any additional recomendations at that time.
.
The second day of admission it was reported that the patient was
uncooperative with care and unable to swallow pills.  The
urology service did come by and changed the patients SPC without
significant difficulty.  During evalaution she was witnessed
having horizontal nystagmus and jaw twitching.  A BG was
obtained which was wnl and a stat EEG was ordered.  The patients
repeat Na was 118 and hypotonic infusions that were able to be
discontinued were.  The patients EEG showed characteristics of
status epilepticus and her seizures broke with ativan 1 mg.  She
was also loaded with 1 g of dilantin.  Neurology consults were
made aware of the situation and they aggreed with the above
management.  Their additional recomendations were to conduct an
LP, cover empirically with vanco/ceftriaxone and acyclovir and
to do a brain MRI when the patient is clinically stable.  It was
decided that a transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was most appropriate at this
time.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course
53 yo female with advanced secondary progressive MS, admitted in
status epilepticus, which was likely secondary to a urinary
tract infection, c/b hyponatremia and septic shock, who
continued to have seizures, with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
and was, consequently, trach'd and PEG'd at the bedside.  Her
anti-epileptic treatment was also complicated by a drug rash.

# Seizures: Upon presentation to the ICU, the patient was in
status epilepticus, which was thought to be secondary to [**Doctor Last Name 3080**]
and hyponatremia.  LP was performed and returned negative for
infectious processes in the CSF.  She was intubated for airway
protection while in status.  She was placed on continuous EEG
monitoring, which showed bifrontal epileptiform seizures.  Her
seizures were treated with levetiracetam, phenytoin, valproic
acid and lacosamide, and therapeutic levels of these medications
were monitored.  Additionally, her [**Doctor Last Name 3080**] and hyponatremia were
treated.  She was evaluated for cerebral structural lesions with
a brain MRI, which showed stable periventricular plaques,
consistent with MS. [**First Name (Titles) 3081**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3080**] and hyponatremia resolved
with treatment and patient was on 4 epileptics, patient
continued to have intermittent seizures.  She also had GPEDs on
her EEG which is c/w high mortality and very poor prognosis from
mental status standpoint.

# Urinary tract infection: Urine culture on presentation grew
Pseudomonas and Serratia, with an I&D of an abscess at the
patient's indwelling suprapubic catheter growing Pseudomonas.
It is likely that the infection lowered the patient's seizure
threshold.  Her UTI was treated with a 14-day course of
cefepime, to which both her Pseudomonas and Serratia were
sensitive.

# Septic shock: Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was in
septic shock, with hypotension, hypothermia, altered mental
status, WBC 14 and left-shift, as well as evidence of end-organ
dysfunction in a transient transaminitis.  Likely source of
infection was the urinary tract, as discussed above.  However,
there was also evidence of possible aspiration on CXR, in the
context of ongoing seizures.  The patient was empirically
treated for HCAP, initially with cefepime, vancomycin and
levofloxacin, which was then tailored to cefepime/vanc as levo
lowers the seizure threshold, for a total of 8 days.  Her
initial hypotension and transaminitis resolved with IV fluids.
Initial thrombocytopenia, which subsequently resolved, was
likely attributable to systemic inflammation as well.  The
patient's vital signs were and WBC were carefully monitored.

# Hyponatremia: On arrival to the ICU, the patient was
hyponatremic.  This was likely due to SIADH, possibly cerebral
salt wasting, and effective intravascular volume depletion due
to third-spacing, which were exacerbated by her acute infection.
 She was treated with free water restriction, normal saline and
diuresis for third-spacing and volume overload.  Her diuresis
was complicated by a metabolic alkalosis, which was corrected
with acetozolamide, potassium supplementation and prudent use of
furosemide.  Acetozolamide was discontnued and patient did not
have re-surfacing of hyponatremia.

# Mechanical ventilation: Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient
was intubated for airway protection, while actively seizing.
After a few days, she began to breathe spotaneously on pressure
support ventilation; however, due to continued seizures, copious
secretions, and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, it was
predicted that she would require prolonged airway protection.
For this reason, Interventional Pulmonology performed a bedside
tracheostomy under sedation at the bedside on [**7-20**] and
Gastroenterology performed a bedside PEG placement on [**7-21**].  The
patient's tracheostomy was complicated by bleeding, as she was
anticoagulated on enoxaparin.  She eventually transitioned to
trach mask, with good oxygen saturation.

#Rash: The patient developed a macular rash on her both of her
lower extremities, which was initially suspected to be due to a
fungal infection; however, KOH stain and fungal cultures
returned negative, and the rash was unresponsive to topical
antifungal medications.  Medication reaction was suspected,
since the rash appeared several days after beginning new
antiepileptic medications.  Biopsy of the rash showed
non-specific signs of inflammation.  The rash responded well to
steroid (fluocinonide 0.01%) ointment.  Her LFTs and CBC were
trended out of concern for DRESS.

# History of PE: The patient was anticoagulated with enoxaparin,
which was held as needed for procedures.  She developed no signs
or symptoms of new thrombosis.

# Normocytic Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia, likely
anemia of chronic disease vs. iron deficiency.  Her anemia was
exacerbated by bleeding after tracheostomy on [**7-20**], but remained
stable thereafter. She had several more episodes of oozing from
the tracheostomy site as well as from the PEG site.
.
#Goals of care: Patient had previously made her goal of care
wishes very clear to her healthcare proxy and her family and
also had it in writing.  Her wish was that if she were not
functional and alert, she did not want extraordinary measures
taken to prolong her life. Primary ICU team and neurology team
had involved family meeting with HCP and 2 daughters.  It was
explained to the family that in the setting of continous
seizures and no improvement in mental status despite resolution
of what was thought to be instigating them (infection,
hyponatremia), long term prognosis for mental status recovery
was very poor.  Family felt that Ms.[**Known lastname 3082**] would not want to be
kept alive like this and decision was to make her CMO and
transfer to [**Known lastname **].

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a year-old woman with a PMH s/f MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] D/O
including a history of status epilepticus who presented to
[**Hospital6 5168**] on the evening of [**2139-10-16**] with chief
complaint of found unresponsive.  History obtained from sister
and from OSH records.  The patient was at home and had a fall,
which was not unusual.  She seemed fine after the fall.  She was
found unresponsive at 8:30pm and brought to the OSH.  She was
noted to have seizures at the OSH by the sister.  She was also
noted to be Febrile to 101.  She had an elevated white count.
[**Date Range **] was managed with ativan (unknown how much)and
phosphenytoin 1000mg x1.   An EEG on [**2139-10-17**] showed rare Left
temporal sharps but no seizures.  The fever workup included
UA/UCx, BCx, chest x-ray, non contrast head CT, and an LP.  None
of these was revealing.  The patient was felt to be in a
protracted post-ictal state.  A decision was made to transfer
the
patient to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  The patient was
put
on a propofol gtt, given fentanyl and intubated for airway
protection, given the concern that she might seize en route.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
Patient lives with her eldest sister and her 82 year old mother
in [**Name (NI) 5169**], MA where she was born.  She is one of six children
having 4 sisters and 1 brother.  She describes her family as
being extremely close and supportive of her.  She is very close
to her mother and is upset about being away from her during this
hospitalization.  She is unemployed at this time due to physical
and cognitive limitations related to her disease.  She worked as
a horticulturist doing research in [**State 4565**] and [**State 5170**] in
the past.  She is divorced, but remains on good terms with her
former husband who lives in CA.  She has no children.  She has
no history of IV drug use, tobacco use or alcohol consumption.


Family History:
Father died of a myocardial infarction.  Mother is alive and at
82 years of age is in good health.  One sister is 42 and also
suffers from a demyelinating disease, (suspected multiple
sclerosis) which has affected her cognition more than her motor
and sensory systems.  This sister has responded well to
Solumedrol infusions and Rebif in the past with resolved speech
and swallowing problems.  [**Name (NI) **] had one paternal uncle with
suspected multiple sclerosis (diagnosed at age 27, died at 42),
another paternal uncle with paranoid schizophrenia, another

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted to the ICU where she did well. she continued to
have fevers in the ICU without obvious source.

Neuro:
Pt was loaded with dilantin with improvement in seizures.
EEG: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry in the
waking and sleeping states due to the slow and disorganized
background
rhythm suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. This may
be
seen with medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, or
infections. There are no regions of focal slowing and no
epileptiform
discharges noted.

She was extubated without incident and repeat EEG without
evidence of electrographic seizures.  pt without [**Last Name (un) 862**]
activity for the rest of her hospital stay. dilantin level was
low, but with possibility that dilantin was cause of fever,
dilantin was discontinued.

pt with improving encephalopathy during stay with return to
fairly baseline mental status, although with continued decreased
strength in her LE and decreased ability to ambulate.

ID: pt continued to have daily fevers.  Abx stopped with
negative cultures. acyclovir CT torso without source.  US of
gallbladder and LE were both negative for source.  HSV PCR at
OSH was not resulted.  Repeat LP was performed without CSF
pleiocytosis so acyclovir was stopped.  Without source,
consideration of possible drug fever.  dilantin level had been
low without [**Last Name (un) 862**] activity.  dilantin was weaned off without
issue with resolution of fever.

PT/OT evaluated the patient and felt that she would benefit
significantly from acute rehabilitation placement.

GI: pt with some difficulty eating. Speech and swallow evaluated
her and found her to have difficulty with solids.  patient's
diet was changed to softs which she tolerated well.

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 67 year old
female with a long medical history including atrial
fibrillation without Coumadin (the patient declined),
supraventricular tachycardia post ablation times two,
multiple sclerosis, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], migraines, and
prescription medication abuse who presented to the Emergency
Room on [**2131-6-8**] complaining of episodic speech arrest
for two days and nausea, diarrhea and headache for one day.
The patient was in her usual state of health until [**2131-6-6**], when she experienced several episodes of speech arrest
while in the car with her husband.  The next day, she awoke
with severe headache and nausea with diarrhea and vomiting
times four in addition to her episodic speech arrest.

Her primary care physician saw her and drew blood which
revealed a potassium of 2.9.   MRI showed periventricular
white matter changes by the inferior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral ventricle as well as left mastoiditis. Her symptoms
continued the next day with headache and vomiting times two
as well as speech arrest.  The patient went to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Room, her vital signs were temperature 97.0
F.; blood pressure 155/74; pulse 72; respiratory rate 16;
oxygen saturation 94%.  She was alert and oriented times
three.  Her examination was nonfocal except for asymmetric
patellar reflexes and difficulty word finding.  The patient
was given p.o. potassium and started on Clarithromycin.
While receiving an EEG from Neurology, the patient had a
tonic-clonic seizure.  She received one gram total of
Dilantin over a one hour time period.

On hour following her seizure, she received 30 mg of
Diltiazem, 10 mg of Lisinopril and 28 mg Nadolol.  An hour
after receiving all three of those medications, her systolic
blood pressure dropped to the 80s, her heart rate dropped to
the 50s and she had decreasing mental status.  She received
28 mg of calcium gluconate intravenous, Atropine 3 mg
intravenously and 500 cc. of normal saline.  Her EKG at the
time showed a narrow junctional rhythm at 54 beats per
minute, T wave inversions in leads III and AVf.  The patient
received more calcium as well as Glucagon and was intubated
for airway protection.  Pacing pads were placed.

Labs in the Emergency Room showed a normal CBC, normal PT and
PTT, normal urinalysis, normal liver function tests, normal
CK and troponin.

Labs were notable for a potassium of 2.9.  Her toxicology
screen was negative.  A lumbar puncture showed no cells in
the cerebrospinal fluid.

CT scan of the head done on [**6-9**] showed mucosal thickening
in her bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.  Chest x-ray
showed minimal bilateral atelectasis.  MRA was normal.  MRI
of the head showed mild changes due to small vessel disease.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on Dopamine,
Propofol and Glucagon intravenously.  Her initial EKG showed
sinus rhythm at 77 beats per minute, normal axis, normal
intervals.  Shortly after her admission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was extubated.  MRI was
repeated and showed no focal abnormalities.  MRA showed no
abnormalities.

On her first day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit she
experienced multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response followed by five second pauses.
Her blood pressure decreased and was restored with 1 mg of
Atropine.

A Cardiology consultation came and placed a pacing wire.

Pulmonary artery catheterization revealed no association
between her heart rate, blood pressure and MVO2, therefore,
there was suspicion for autonomic dysfunction.  Dopamine was
weaned off.  She was seen by Electrophysiology who determined
that she had sick sinus syndrome and implanted a pacemaker on
[**2131-6-11**].

An echocardiogram was also done on [**6-11**].  This showed a
mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular
thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than
55% and one plus mitral regurgitation.

Despite treatment of her bradycardia, episodes of hypotension
continued times two, requiring IVF of 250 cc. plus Midodrine
10 mg times one.  She was seen by the Congestive heart
failure Service who recommended Diltiazem for her blood
pressure control.

The patient had one episode of shortness of breath on [**2131-6-13**] in the morning which was resolved with Lasix.

Her mental status improved to the point where she was
conversational on [**2131-6-13**], however, she became confused
and began speaking nonsensically that evening.  On the
morning of admission to CC7, the patient underwent a CT scan
of the head.  CT scan was consistent with the prior
examination.

Results from her most recent EEG revealed no seizures but an
irregular rhythm was noted on the cardiac monitor.  Coumadin
and aspirin were begun for prophylaxis against atrial
fibrillation related stroke.  Her Team determined that she
was stable for transfer to CC7.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.3 F.; blood pressure
148/72; pulse 80; respiratory rate 18; O2 saturation 97% on
room air.  In general, in no acute distress, resting
comfortably, alert and oriented times three (with effort).
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck supple, no jugular venous
distention, no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales or
rhonchi.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, plus bowel
sounds.  Extremities warm and well perfused.  No cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Two plus pulses.  Neurological:  The
patient is oriented times three but confused, attempting to
place her pencil in her coffee and asking for a number
repeatedly perseverating on seeing her rabbi.  Twitching left
leg noted during examination.

LABORATORY:  Normal CBC.  Chem-7 notable for potassium of
3.2, normal PT, PTT and INR.  Normal protein and albumin.
Chest x-ray showed improved prominence of the vasculature
suggesting improvement of her congestive heart failure.
Bilaterally pleural effusions and atelectasis were noted.  No
pneumothorax, no consolidation.

EKG on [**6-11**] showed a sinus and paced rhythm.  Rate 67.  PR
zero, QRS 94, QT/QTC 416/431.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 139**] on
Telemetry.  She was continued on Dilantin for seizure
prevention and no further seizures were noted throughout the
course of her stay.

The cause of the patient's confusion and changing mental
status was thought to be possible post-ictal state versus a
toxic metabolic syndrome.

The cause of the patient's hypotension was never completely
elucidated, however, it was thought to be related to
autonomic dysfunction.  In light of the fact that the patient
had been on steroids several years prior to admission, a
morning cortisol test was done.  The result was 10.2.

The patient experienced no further episodes of bradycardia,
and no more episodes of hypotension after being transferred
to CC7.  The patient's main active issue while on CC7 was her
mental status.

On her first day on CC7, the patient was confused with speech
arrest.  This was similar to her initial presentation to the
Emergency Room.  On the following day, however, the patient
was no longer confused but rather was experiencing paranoid
delusions regarding her Telemetry wires being a recording
device and her home being robbed and her husband's phone
lines being tapped.  The patient was very afraid of these
delusions.

Psychiatry was consulted regarding the patient's change in
mental status and felt that the delusions were likely a
result of resolving delirium.  However, it was discovered
that the patient may have a history of bipolar disorder and
was treated with Zyprexa in the past.  It was also discovered
that the patient has attempted to commit suicide at least
three times in the past and took Valium with the intention of
killing herself within the last month; thus, it was difficult
to elucidate the degree to which her previous psychiatric
history was implicated in her current psychiatric symptoms.

At the time of this dictation, the patient has been medically
stable since her arrival to CC7 with no episodes of
bradycardia or hypotension.  She has been afebrile throughout
her stay.

As per Psychiatry's recommendation, we feel that the patient
should be transferred to a Geriatric Psychiatric Unit to
further address her issues of psychosis and suicidality.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Medically, the patient is stable
for discharge.  Of note, her mental status has improved
significantly since one day ago.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient will be transferred to the
[**Last Name (un) 5433**] Center for Geriatric Psychiatry.

isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to

IMAGING:
CXR [**2170-12-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Subtle minimal ill-defined opacity within the right
lung base may reflect an area of developing infection. No
evidence for pulmonary edema.

ECHO [**2170-12-14**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ U/S [**2170-12-14**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Small liver hemangioma. Otherwise, normal-appearing liver.
2. Fullness of the bilateral renal pelvises without
hydronephrosis.
3. Gallbladder wall edema without significant distention of the
gallbladder
likely relates to third spacing. Sludge within the dependent
portion of the
gallbladder.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Trace ascites.
7. Left renal cyst.

BLE U/S [**2170-12-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive thrombus within a left posterior tibial
vein with
possible occlusive thrombus in a second left posterior tibial
vein versus
superficial vein.
2. No additional deep venous thrombosis within the bilateral
lower
extremities.

CXR [**2170-12-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip
approximately 10 cm above the carina. The tube should be
advanced approximately 4 cm. The patient's nurse, [**Doctor First Name 7279**], was
notified by phone on [**2170-12-16**] at 8:42 a.m. the need for
repositioning.
2. Both costophrenic angles are not included on this study.
There is a
bilateral diffuse airspace process which again appears slightly
improved
favoring that this represents some moderate-to-severe pulmonary
edema rather than diffuse pneumonia. However, clinical
correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
are stable. No large pneumothorax
appreciated.

[**Year (4 digits) 4338**] Brain, C-spine [**2170-12-21**]:
Scattered areas of high signal intensity in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter, extending to the callosal septal
region,
consistent with demyelination and related with a history of
multiple
sclerosis. The plaques are more numerous since [**2163**], there is no
evidence of abnormal enhancement. No mass effect or shifting of
the normally midline structures is present.

The alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies appears
maintained,
disc degenerative changes are identified, consistent with disc
desiccation, mild posterior disc bulge is noted at C4-C5,
causing anterior thecal sac deformity and impinging the thecal
sac (image 13, series 19). There is no evidence of neural
foraminal narrowing or significant spinal canal stenosis.

Disc degenerative changes are also present at C6-C7 level with
narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, Schmorl's node and
endplate changes are
visualized at this level, consistent with bone marrow
replacement for fat
(image 8, series 16). The spinal cord demonstrates areas of high
signal
intensity on the fat suppression sequence, more evident at C2,
C3 and C5
levels, likely consistent with demyelinating plaques. There is
no evidence of abnormal enhancement in this area.

Head CT [**2170-12-25**]
Final Report
INDICATION: 64-year-old male with MS presents with coagulopathy,
respiratory
distress and mental status change. Rule out ICH.

COMPARISON: [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] of [**2170-12-21**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain without IV contrast.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A tiny amount of hyperdense
material is seen in a right frontal sulcus (2:20) and a right
temporal sulcus (2:14) concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
In addition, there is a small amount of hyperdense material
layering in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle
concerning for intraventricular hemorrhage (2:17). There is no
intraparenchymal hemorrhage or extra-axial collection.

There is no major vascular territory infarction, mass effect, or
edema.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There is
age-appropriate
prominence of ventricles and sulci compatible with diffuse
parenchymal volume loss. Globes and lenses are intact. Mucosal
thickening in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses is noted,
but the remainder of visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are well aerated. There is no suspicious lytic or
sclerotic bone lesion.

IMPRESSION:

1. Findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right
frontal and
temporal lobes and a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage
in the left
lateral ventricle. Close interval follow up recommended to
exclude
progression.

2. Left maxillary and sphenoid sinus inflammatory disease.

COMMENT: Findings discussed by phone with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1255**] [**Name (STitle) 1256**] at 10
PM on
[**2170-12-25**].

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In retrospect, the diffusely
abnormal
hyperintensity on the FLAIR sequences from the MR examination of
[**2170-12-21**] was in the subarachnoid space, rather than
cortically-based (as reported). This likely represented diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage in cortical sulci, and there was a
""sedimentation layer"" in the trigone and occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle at that time (8,12:[**10-23**]). No pathologic
leptomeningeal or dural enhancement was demonstrated on that
exam.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

HEAD CT [**2170-12-26**]
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 64-year-old male with MDS and MS, found to
have
intracranial hemorrhage and altered mental status, for followup.

COMPARISON: [**2170-12-25**] CT, [**2170-12-21**] MR.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were acquired of the head without
contrast and
reformatted into coronal and sagittal planes.

FINDINGS:

Hyperdense material is again seen layering within the occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle. There has been interval development of
hyperdense
material layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle,
increasing the probability that this does in fact represent
hemorrhage. While the ventricles are mildly prominent, there is
no dilatation of the temporal horns to suggest hydrocephalus.
The sulci also are prominent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter/white matter
differentiation remains preserved. Hypodensity in the frontal
white matter, extending superiorly from the corpus callosum is
consistent with the known demyelinating lesions seen better on
[**Doctor Last Name 4338**].
Hyperdense foci are also seen within frontal sulci (image 26),
which is
nonspecific and could represent subarachnoid hemorrhage or
calcification.

There is minimal mucosal change of the left maxillary sinus, and
there is
partial opacification of left mastoid air cells. Additionally,
there is an
air-fluid level seen within the left sphenoid sinus with mucosal
thickening.

IMPRESSION:
1. Redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage, now seen
within the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally.
2. Subtle hyperdensity within multiple sulci, likely reflecting
resorption and redistribution of the diffuse subarachnoid blood
seen on the MR study of [**2170-12-21**] is unchanged from the NECT
obtained only 10 hours earlier.
3. There has been further ventricular dilatation since the
remote MR study of [**2163-2-12**], but this more likely reflects
progressive global, including central atrophy, rather than
developing hydrocephalus.

interpreted as NORMAL. Two hybridization signals were
detected in 94/100 nuclei examined, which is within the
normal range established for this probe in the
Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 6% of cells in
normal samples can show apparent trisomy 8 using this
probe set. A normal chromosome 8 FISH finding can result
from absence of trisomy for chromosome 8 or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the
Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is
interpreted as NORMAL. Two hybridization signals were
observed in 97/100 nuclei examined, which is within the
normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 8% of cells in normal samples
can show apparent 20q deletion using this probe set. A
normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q
deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the
region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

==============    DIAGNOSIS     ============

 SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY.

DIAGNOSIS:
HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, TRILINEAGE
DYSPLASIA, AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS. SEE NOTE.

Note: The findings are highly suspicious for a myelodysplastic
disorder best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts
(RAEB-2) based on the number of myeloblasts in the peripheral
blood (a marrow aspirate could not be obtained) and the core
biopsy immunostained with CD34. However, given the clinical
presentation of the patient with severe anemia and acute high
output cardiac failure the findings in this marrow need to be
interpreted with caution and a follow up biopsy is highly
recommended, unless cytogenetic studies confirm myelodysplastic
syndrome or other related myeloproloferative disorder. Please
correlate with cytogenetic findings and clinical evolution.


MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smear:
The peripheral blood smear is adequate for evaluation.
Erythrocytes exhibit anisopoikilocytosis, targets, bite cells,
elliptocytes, dacrocytes, and show polychromasia and basophilic
stippling.  The white cell count is decreased.  Neutrophils are
decreased and exhibit dysplastic features including
hyposegmentation.  Pseudo Pelger-[**Doctor Last Name **]??????t forms are present as well
as hypogranular forms. Monocytes are normal in number and
exhibit mild dysplasia.  Lymphocytes are decreased in number and
include some large granular lymphocytes.  Platelets are
decreased in number and many are hypogranular and large.
Multiple nucleated red blood cells are seen (50% of nucleated
cells) and exhibit significant dyspoiesis including asymmetric
nuclear budding, nuclear fragments and cytoplasmic nuclear dy
synchrony.  Differential shows 54% neutrophils, 2% bands, 18%
lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 4% basophils; 12%
blasts and 1% myelocytes.

Aspirate Smear:
An aspirate smear was not submitted.

Biopsy and clot sections:
Two cores are received both measuring 9mm in length. One core
consists almost entirely of fibrotic marrow with variable
cellularity, which ranges from 5% to 20%.  The second core is
cellular with an overall cellularity of 70-80%. The M:E ratio
appears decreased.  Erythroid precursors are increased and
exhibit dyspoietic maturation. Myeloid precursors are decreased
in number and exhibit dysplastic maturation. Megakaryocytes are
increased and exhibit dysplastic maturation.

Special Stains:  A CD34 stain highlights blasts comprising
10-20% of the marrow cellularity.  CD33 is immunoreactive in
approximately one third of the marrow cells.  E-Cadherin and
glycophorin-A highlight erythroblasts. There is a greater
percentage of cells staining for glycophorin-A than E-cadherin
which is immunoreactive in about one third of the cells,
indicating that the majority of the erythroblasts are undergoing
maturation.   CD42 reveals numerous megakaryocytes.  MPO
staining is dim and stains approximately 20% or less in the
cells.  CD68 stains most myeloid precursors as well as increased
marrow histiocytes.  CD117 (CKit) has strong staining in the
mast cells and reveals an increased number. Dimly stained cell
with CD117 correspond to increased megakaryocytes.

Cytogenetic Studies:
See separate report.

Flow Cytometry Studies:

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR,
Glycophorin A, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,
10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 71, 117.

RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize blast yield. There are two dominant populations in the
blast gate.  One population is slightly dimmer than lymphocytes
for CD45 and exhibits a phenotype consistent with myeloblasts
(positive for CD45, CD34, CD33, CD11c, CD117 (dim), CD15, CD13
and are negative for CD14, CD41, CD56, CD64, and glycophorin.  A
second population which express only low levels of CD45 lacks
all lymphoid and myeloid markers but is positive for CD71 and
glycophorin-a and represent erythroblasts.

INTERPRETATION
Immunophentopyic findings consistent with an increased
population of myelodysplastic and erythroblasts, and suggest a
myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts or acute
leukemia.  Please correlate with the morphologic findings in the
marrow biopsy and a blast count. Please see concurrent bone
marrow report S11-[**Numeric Identifier 7596**].

Clinical:  Multiple sclerosis and new pancytopenia.

Gross: Bone marrow for immunophenotyping.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo M with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis presenting
with increasing fatigue/weakness, b/l LE swelling, and
pancytopenia, bone marrow consistent with MDS, course
complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, DVT/PE, Pneumonia,
ICH.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient initially presented with
increasing fatigue.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring intubation.  Differential included PE (patient with
DVT found on LE ultrasound), transfusion associated circulatory
overload [**2-14**] to rapid multiple transfusions, and less likely
pneumonia.  CXR revealed a diffuse bilateral pattern. Initially
covered with Vanc/Cefepime, but then discontinued Vanc/Cefepime
after 2 days when likelihood of pneumonia low.  Patient treated
for DVT (potential PE) with heparin drip. Extubation was
performed on HD 5, however patient was extremely tachypnic and
required re-intubation. Antibiotics were restarted with
vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin and patient completed a
ten day course.  He was diuresed over the next several days with
IV lasix (bolus and drip) for treatment of transfusion
associated circulatory overload.  In addition, patient had a
large left sided effusion, largely related to volume
overload/pulmonary edema, which was drained by thoracentesis.
Fluid was consistent with transudate and culture was negative.
Difficulty extubating was also thought to be related to
underlying multiple sclerosis causing neuromuscular weakness.
Negative inspiratory force was low, but gradually improved and
on HD 10, patient was successfully extubated. His respiratory
status continued to improve and he had saturations in the mid to
high 90s on room air at the time of discharge.

# Deep vein thrombosis:  Patient had bilateral swelling of lower
extremities on presentation.  Doppler ultrasound showed a
partially occlusive clot in the left lower extremity.  Patient
was placed on heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80 given patient's
high risk of bleeding given his pancytopenia. He was kept on
heparin drip while intubated, and upon extubation and clearance
by speech and swallow he was transitioned to lovenox and given
one dose of warfarin. Lovenox was however discontinued due to
thrombocytopenia.  The patient therefore underwent successful
placement of an IVC filter by IR.  A CTA was deferred given
patient's initial acute kidney injury.

# Hypotension: Concern of sepsis from urinary and pulmonary
sources.  Sedation may also have contributed to hypotension.
Adrenal insufficiency ruled out by normal cortisol AM level and
cortisol stim test.  Right IJ placed, but patient did not
require pressor support. Blood pressures remained low normal
throughout his hospitalization.  His systolic blood pressures
were in the 100-110s at the time of discharge.
.
# Myelodysplastic syndrome: Patient presented with pancytopenia.
 Bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with erythroblasts without
evidence of leukemia.  Viral studies negative for CMV, HSV, HIV,
EBV, and parvovirus.  Patient treated with supportive blood
products, transfusion threshold Hct<21 and Plt<30.  Patient
required a total of 12 units of pRBC and 14 units of platelets
throughout hospitalization. He was started on neupogen 480mcg
daily per BMT recommendations, this was discontinued on
discharge as he was no longer acutely infected.  Once patient's
respiratory status was stabilized, he was transferred to BMT
floor for further management. Given the patients current
deconditioned status he is not a good candidate for therapy at
this time. He will follow-up with Hematology/Oncology as an
outpatient to determine further management of his MDS. For now
he will be managed with transfusion support.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient has progressive MS, with recent
deteriorations.  Per conversation with outpatient neurologist,
[**Month/Day (2) 7595**] was not a necessary medication and was discontinued.
Oxacarbazepam was initially held as concern for cause of
pancytopenia, however it was restarted once bone marrow showed
MDS.  An [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] was performed which showed increased numbers of
plaques compared to [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] from [**2163**].  Patient complained of
worsening right greater than left upper and lower extremity
weakness, which improved following extubation, but was still
quite debilitating.  In addition, difficulty extubating was
attributed to MS [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4338**] showed plaques in C3-C5 concerning for
involvement of the phrenic nerve.  However, as above, following
extubation, patient had no signs of neuromuscular weakness
effecting his ability to breath independently. The patient was
evaluated by PT who felt the patient would benefit from
intensive rehab.
.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: Patient was noted to have 2
episodes of tachycardia to the 150s after transfer to the BMT
service.  EKG showed an SVT (most likely AVNRT).  During theses
episodes his blood pressure decreased to SBP of high 80s.  He
also became mildly confused during the first episode. Each time
he was given adenosine 6 mg once with return of sinus rhythm and
improvement in his blood pressure.  Following the second episode
he was started on metoprolol tartrate which was titrated upward
to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of
his hospitalization. He will need to follow-up with his [**Hospital1 3390**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **] regarding need for outpatient cardiology referral.
.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: On [**12-25**] patient was noted to be
confused.  Given his low platelet count there was concern for an
intracranial hemorrhage. A head CT did show a small focus of
intraventricular hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle and
small foci of possible SAH. The patient was given vitamin K to
reverse the coumadin he had received that day, FFP and
platelets. Repeat head CT 7 8 hours later was unchanged and the
patients neuro exam was stable.  Neurosurgery was consulted and
recommended keeping platelets > 80 for 7 days and follow up in 1
month.
.
# Acute mental status changes: Patient was noted to be confused
on transfer from the ICU. This was felt to be multi-factorial in
nature. ICU delirium was likely a factor as mental status
improved with better sleep hygiene.  Additionally, as above the
patient was noted to have a small intracranial hemorrhage.
Infectious work-up including blood cultures and urine cultures
were negative though the patient was undergoing treatment of
pneumonia. Chemistry panel was unremarkable.  The patients
mental status continued to improve and was at baseline at the
time of discharge.
.
# Urinary retention- Patient noted to be retaining urine after
removal of a foly catheter.  Catheter was replaced. He will need
repeat voiding trial in [**3-16**] days ([**1-1**], [**1-2**])
.
# Elevated INR - Patient noted to have INR elevated to 1.3-1.6.
He was given vitamin K 5 mg x 2. He was started on PO vitamin K
5 mg weekly.  This medication should be continued on discharge.
His INR should be monitored at rehab with discontinuation of
medication when INR is within normal limits.
.
# Urinary tract infection:  Urine culture was positive for
pansensitive citrobacter from the urine.  Patient completed a
7-day course of ciprofloxacin. Subsequent urine cultures were
negative as were several blood cultures.
.
# Hypernatremia: Patient's sodium was high during admission.
This was treated with free water flushes via OG tube while
patient was intubated.  Hypernatremia resolved and did not
return.
.
# Transaminitis: Initially elevated, then trended down.  RUQ
showed no signs of hepatic congestion or infiltrative disease.
No venous thrombosis. Hepatitis serologies negative, CMV
negative, EBV, HIV negative.  [**Month (only) 116**] still be medication induced.
This resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr initially elevated, likely [**2-14**] severe
hypovolemia in the setting of severe anemia.  Trended back to
baseline with transfusions and remained stable throughout
hospitalization.
.
# Hyperuricemia: Uric acid was 11.0.  Potassium and phosphate
were not consistent wtih tumor lysis syndrome.  Patient was
started on allopurinol to decrease uric acid level as there was
concern that high level may be contributing to acute kidney
injury. His allopurinol dose was decreased to 100 mg daily prior
to discharge.
.
# Overall goals of care: Established friend, [**Name (NI) 6739**], to be
health care proxy.  Following extubation, patient expressed his
wishes to be DNR/DNI.  Paperwork for code status and health care
proxy were completed with the assistance of social work.

# Transitional issues:
- Patient is DNR/DNI
- Patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**] (Heme/Onc), Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 739**] (Neuro [**Doctor First Name **]), Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Neurology), he should
also call to make an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] ([**First Name (STitle) 3390**]) after
being discharged from rehab
- Blood cultures were pending at the time of discharge
- Patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] facility in
[**Hospital1 8**]
- Patient will need monitoring of his INR, CBC and Chem-10

Discharge Instructions:
Mr [**Known lastname 7597**]

It was a pleasure participating in your care while you were
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**].  As you know
you were admitted because you had swelling in you legs.  You
were found to have a clot in your left leg.  You were also found
to have very low blood counts due to your bone marrow not
working properly.  You were given blood and platelets.  Since
your blood counts are low we cannot give you blood thinners to
treat the clot so a filter was placed in one of your blood
vessels to prevent it from traveling to your lungs.

You also had trouble breathing while in the hospital and
required placement of a breathing tube.  This was successfully
taken out and you are now breathing on your own.

Your heart was noted to have an irregular rhythm that was very
fast. We started you on medication to help control your rate.

You were also noted to have a small bleed in your brain.  This
has been stable.  There is nothing that needs to be done for
this currently however you will need to follow-up with the
neurosurgeons in 1 month.
We made the following changes to your medications
1. STOP [**Hospital1 **]
2. STOP Naltrexone
3. DECREASE Provigil to 200 mg in the morning and stop taking it
at night
4. DECREASE Ativan to [**1-14**] pill as needed at night
5. START Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice a day
6. START allopurinol 100 mg daily
7. START senna, colace as needed for constipation
8. START tylenol as needed for pain
9. START vitamin K 5 mg every week
10. START ketoconazole shampoo every other day
.
Please feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns

Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for decitabine cycle #1 for MDS.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7597**] is a 64 year old gentleman with a PMH of MS, and a
recent diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, now being admitted
electively for decitabine(15mg/m2 Q8 x3 days), cycle one.  He
was diagnosed with MS in [**2154**], and felt that his MS symptoms of
fatigue were progressing in the fall of [**2170**], at which point he
was found to have progressive LE edema and a new systolic murmur
at his [**Year (4 digits) 3390**]'s.  Labs at that time showed pancytopenia, ARF and
transaminitis.  He was admitted to the hospital from [**Date range (1) 7599**],
with anemia and UTI.  After transfusion of 9 units PRBCs and 6
units of platelets, patient developed volume overload and
high-output heart failure (EF>55%), and susequent respiratory,
requiring ICU admission, intubation and aggressive diuresis.
Patient also received empiric antibioitcs for HCAP.  ICU course
also complciated by slow lower GIB, and partially occlusive L
tibial DVT.  Bone marrow biopsy during that admission showed
hypercellular marrow with extensive fibrosis, trinlineage
dysplasia, and increased myeloblasts.  12% Findings highly
suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as
refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the # of
myeloblasts in the peripheral blood. Peripheral blood w/
deletion 7q, and 5q.
.
Since his last admission, the patient has been improving at
rehab (at [**Hospital1 **]).  He continues to have dyspnea on exertion,
but this is stable.  He also continues to have neuropathic pain,
related to his MS, which includes burning dysethesias, painful
vibratory sensations and spasticity.  These symptoms improve
with lorazepam.  In the past, his symptoms had been
well-controlled with copaxoen, which was discontinued at the
time of his MDS diagnosis.  Additionally, patient notes
significant anxiety, especially surrounding his MS symptoms.  He
has been taking lorazepam consistently on a q3-4 hour basis.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was comfortable and
optimistic regarding the initiation of treatment.
.
Review of systems:
Positive as noted in the HPI.  Also positive for chronic
constipation with intermittent hematochezia.
Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss/gain, chest pain,
shortness of breath at rest, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria.
 Otherwise negative.

Past Medical History:
- Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosed in [**2154**]. Multiple resolving
flares. Multiple lesions detected on [**Year (4 digits) 4338**]. Has been treated with
alternative medications and acupuncture after having a bad
experience with amantadine.
- Osteoporosis
- Vitamin D deficiency
- MDS, dx [**12/2170**]

Social History:
Patient coming in from [**Hospital3 **] now.  Previously lived
alone and has since college.  No current alcohol.  Quit smoking
~20 years ago.  Continues to smoke marijuana occasionally for
spasticity.  No other illicit drug use.

.
[**2171-1-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Cardiac size is normal. Right PICC tip
is in the lower SVC. The left lung is clear. Right lower lobe
opacity is the combination of moderate-to-large right pleural
effusion with adjacent atelectasis, underlying infectious
process cannot be excluded. There are no new lung abnormalities.
.
[**2171-1-31**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. New opacification at the left base may represent early
pneumonia or atelectasis. Would recommend short term follow up
with subsequent radiographs.
2. Slight decrease in size of moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Persistent consolidation in the right base is likely
atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**2171-2-5**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. Relatively extensive and probably
loculated right pleural effusion.  Subsequent areas of right
atelectasis. The left lung is unremarkable.  Unchanged size of
the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the right PICC line.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo man with MS and recently diagnosed MDS RAEB-2 admitted for
cycle #1 decitabine.  Course complicated by hypoxia and
hypotension.  CXR showed RLL and LLL infiltrate.  Transferred to
ICU for hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids.  Vancomycin,
cefepime, and metronidazole started.  Diarrhea resolved, C. diff
negative.
.
# MDS/pancytopenia: Started cycle #1 decitabine [**2171-1-29**], but
interrupted [**2171-1-31**] due to hypoxia/hypotension/ICU transfer.
Restarted [**2171-2-3**] and finished [**2171-2-4**].  Transfused 1U pRBC
[**2171-2-1**], [**2171-2-6**], [**2171-2-7**], and [**2171-2-8**].  Low retic index.
Transfused PLTs [**2171-2-8**].  Continued TMP-SMX and acyclovir
prophylaxis.  Continued allopurinol for hyperuricemia.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely due to recurrent aspiration pneumonia +
right-sided pleural effusion considering hypoxia, fever to 102F
[**2171-1-31**], tachypnea (RR 30), hypotension, and CXR findings.  BNP
3543 on [**2170-12-13**].  Echo [**2170-12-14**] showed LVEF >55%, moderate MR,
and mild pulmonary HTN.  He refused a repeat video swallow
having had one last week as an outpatient.  He was explained the
risks of aspiration including pneumonia and death, but still
refused.  Bedside swallow eval was normal.  Overt aspiration
[**12/2170**] resolved, but this event seemed to be a recurrence.
Completed a course of cefepime and metronidazole for
hospital-acquired pneumonia with neutropenia and history of
aspiration (started [**2171-1-30**], stopped day of discharge).
Vancomycin stopped earlier given negative cultures and
resolution of symptoms.  Continued albuterol/iptratropium.
Thoracentesis of right-sided pleural effusion (new since
[**12/2170**]) was not done considering infectious risk while
neutropenic and no hypoxia or dyspnea.
.
# Hypotension: Due to sepsis/infection (pneumonia) and
hypovolemia (diarrhea +/- furosemide).  Resolved with IV fluids
and abx, but this AM is hypotensive again after re-instituting
metoprolol for tachycardia.  Improved again more IV normal
saline [**2171-2-6**].
.
# Neutropenic fever: Due to aspiration pneumonia.  Treated as
above.
.
# Tachycardia: Cardiology consulted.  EKG consistent with AVNRT.
 Metoprolol stopped [**2171-1-31**] for hypotension (ICU transfer), so
restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  Repeat CXR unchanged.  Cardiac enzymes
negative.  TSH normal.  Increased metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Diarrhea: Possibly antibiotic-induced.  C. diff toxin negative
x3.  Stool cultures negative x1.  Resolved.
.
# Thrush: Continued fluconazole while neutropenic.
.
# Coagulopathy: Getting vitamin K on Saturdays.  Mixing study
negative.  Fibrinogen elevated.  Occasional schistocytes

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Cycle #1 decitabine chemotherapy.
2. MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome).
3. Hypoxia (low oxygen level).
4. Hypotension (low blood pressure).
5. Aspiration pneumonia.
6. Right-sided pleural effusion (fluid on the lung).
7. Multiple sclerosis.
8. Anemia (low red blood cell count).
9. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
10. Coagulopathy (abnormal clotting tests).
11. Supraventricular tachycardia (fast heart rate).

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for cycle #1 decitabine
chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  This three day
course was interrupted due to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and
low blood pressure.  Because of the severity of the low blood
pressure, you were temporarily transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.  A chest x-ray showed a new pneumonia and fluid in the
right lung (pleural effusion).  You were given IV antibiotics
and IV fluids and recovered quickly.  Chemotherapy was restarted
and finished [**2171-2-4**].  Concern was raised about recurrent
aspiration as the cause of your recent pneumonias.  However, you
refused a video swallow test because of severe pain from the
multiple sclerosis.  Also during your stay, your heart rate
became very fast, so you were evaluated by Cardiology and
restarted on metoprolol, a blood pressure medication that also
controls heart rate.  After starting this, your blood pressure
became very low for a short while and improved with IV fluids.
You blood counts remain low from myelodysplastic syndrome and
chemotherapy.  You should have your blood counts checked at
least every other day until they stabilize because you will
continue to need frequent transfusions.  You are also
susceptible to infections because of a low white blood cell
count.  Avoid sick contacts.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
1. Metoprolol 25mg 2x a day.
2. You completed a course of antibiotics while in the hospital.

Blood culture [**2167-5-27**]: negative
Blood culture [**2167-5-27**]: GPCs in pairs and chains
Urine culture [**2167-5-29**]: negative

IMAGING:
CXR [**2167-5-26**]: 1. Bibasilar opacities could reflect aspiration or
atelectasis. 2. Right costophrenic angle blunting could reflect
pleural thickening given chronicity of appearance.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2167-5-26**]:
1. Large staghorn calculus in the left renal pelvis, new from
[**2161**] CT.
Possible mild pyelitis though no overt signs of pyelonephritis.
Suprapubic
catheter in place with apparent bladder wall thickening,
correlate for
infection.
2. Mild dilation of the redundant sigmoid colon without distal
obstruction
-likely [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome. Mild fecal rectal impaction.
3. Stable hepatic hemangioma.
4. Bibasilar opacities in the lungs, likely [**Last Name (un) **] atelectasis
or
aspiration.

CXR [**2167-5-31**]: Interval changes suggest interval development of
CHF with
interstitial edema.

CXR [**2167-5-31**]: A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip over
distal SVC near SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected.
Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT [**2167-5-31**]: No evidence of DVT in the
right upper extremity.

TTE [**2167-6-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse or
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved regional and
global biventricular systolic function. Very small
circumferential pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Sepsis Secondary to Pyelonephritis/Bacteremia:  Patient with
endstage MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] suprapubic cath presented with fevers,
tachycardia, and leukocytosis with dirty UA.  CT abdomen was
concerning for struvite stone in left kidney.  He was initially
admitted to MICU w/sepsis requiring fluid boluses and pressors,
and was empirically started on vancomycin/zosyn for broad
coverage. Stablizied and was off pressors since [**5-28**].  Urology
consulted with no recommendations for change in suprapubic
catheter exchange (recently replaced 2 weeks prior to
presentation per report), though did recommend percutaneous
nephrostomy tube placement.  Patient had IR placement of left
nephrostomy tube on [**2167-5-27**], and had adequate urostomy drainage
and improvement in hemodynamics/leukocytosis/fevers by post
intervention day 2.  Patient likely has colonization of
resistant bacteria from his [**Date Range **] suprapubic Foley, though
acute infection occurring now in setting of left kidney staghorn
calculus. Urine culture positive for Proteus mirabilis,
providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, and vanc-sensitive
enterococcus. Per Urology, would have high suspicion that
Proteus was responsible for much of acute infection, as this
bacteria is known to cause calculi. Patient was continued on
vanc/zosyn but was switched to vanc/ertapenem on [**2167-6-2**], and
per Urology recs patient should continue on this regimen through
Urology follow-up appt on [**2167-6-17**].  Will likely need surgical
management of left staghorn calculi at that time.  Left
nephrostomy tube should remain in place and open to drainage
until Urologyg follow-up.  Of note, blood cultures from [**2167-5-27**]
positive for GPCs in pairs and chains, though speciation still
pending at time of discharge.  TTE was suboptimal but did not
show evidence of vegetations.  Patient already on >2 week course
of broad spectrum abx.

#) Hypoxia: Patient not on O2 at baseline, though was requiring
5L NC suppplemental O2 on arrival to floor following ICU stay.
CXR [**5-31**] showed e/o effusions and interstitial edema, as well as
probable atalectasis.  Suspected volume overload following ICU
course with IVF and pressor administration in setting of sepsis.
 Echo showed preseved systolic function with EF >55. [**Month (only) 116**] also be
component of aspiration, and per speech and swallow evaluation
patient should only have ice chips with supervision, otherwise
strict NPO.  Patient diuresed with 20mg IV furosemide on [**6-1**],
and was net negative 2.1L with improvement in O2 sat to 93% on
RA.  O2 sats should be monitored on discharge, and patient
should continue on albuterol/ipratropium nebs Q6H prn
cough/wheeze/SOB.  Will require suctioning of secretions, and
should be NPO with all meds given via G-tube.

#) Apnea/Transient desaturation: Likely secondary to patient's
neuromuscular disease/MS and inability to clear secretions.
Patient failed multiple trials of CPAP while in the ICU, though
was able to tolerate CPAP on floor.  Will need outpatient sleep
study once discharged.

#) AFib with RVR: Patient with new onset AFib with RVR to 140s
in the setting of transient apnea and desaturations.  Patient
was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 TID.  His episodes
spontaneously resolved after 5-10 minutes, and he coverted back
to NSR.  For CHADS2 score 0-1, was started on aspirin 81 mg.
Echo showed moderate LA enlargement.

#) Abdominal pain/distention with 1 week's worth of
constipation: Imaging consistent with [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome, which
can be a complication of multiple sclerosis as well as [**Last Name (un) **]
oxybutynin use.  DC'd anticholinergics and started aggressive
bowel regimen with good results. No evidence of perforation on
imaging.  Patient was not restarted on oxybutynin on discharge.


#) Positive troponin on admission: Likely strain as CK-MB was
flat. There are EKG changes relative to previous EKG from [**2160**],
but clinical picture more consistent with strain than ACS.  Echo
showed preserved systolic function.

#) Multiple sclerosis: Held oxybutynin per above but continued
baclofen.  Will need suctioning of oral secretions.

LABS/STUDIES PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Blood culture [**2167-5-27**]: speciation of GPCs

ISSUES REQUIRING FOLLOW-UP:
-Patient with new onset Afib this admission and was started on
metoprolol for rate control and ASA 81mg daily.  Will need
outpatiet follow-up
-Patient should continue on aggresive bowel regimen and discuss
with PCP whether he should restart oxybutynin
-Patient's FSBS were elevated this admission in setting of acute
infection, and should be monitored in outpatient setting
-Patient may benefit from outpatient sleep study given concern
for sleep apnea, may also benefit from CPAP at night if patient
will tolerate

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9319**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
You were initially admitted to the ICU with fevers and abdominal
pain.  We found you had a urinary tract infection/kidney
infection, due to a large stone in your left kidney.  You were
seen by the Urologists, who recommended you have a tube placed
to help drain urine from the left kidney while the stone is
causing an obstruction.

We started you on antibiotics, and gave you IV fluids and
medications to help raise your blood pressure.  You improved
with these treatments and were stable for transfer to the
medicine floor.

The urologists recommend you continue on IV antibiotics for
another 2 week course.  They will see you in the clinic after
the infection has resolved, to discuss what the next steps are
to treat the kidney stone.  The tube in your kidney will remain
in place until that appointment.

While you were here, you heart also went in and out of an
abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  We started you on
an aspirin, and also a medication to control your heart rate.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STARTED aspirin 81mg daily
2. STARTED metoprolol 12.5mg TID
3. STARTED vancomycin 1gm IV Q12H (through [**2167-6-17**])
4. STARTED ertapenem 1gm daily (through [**2167-6-17**])
5. STOPPED oxybutynin (please discuss whether you should restart
this medication with your PCP)

We did not make any other changes to your medications.  Please
continue to take them as you have been doing.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 yo F with multiple sclerosis and metastatic
melanoma p/w FTT at home. Known metastatic disease to brain,
spleen, spine. Patient with chronic back pain secondary to
metastatic disease. The patient reports that it has been
difficult to manage at home since around [**Holiday **] when she
discovered the recurrence of the melanoma in her left axilla.
Over the past 1-2 weeks she has had persistent lower back pain
and poor PO intake. She reports low grade fevers to 99 at home
with difficulty sleeping over the last few weeks. Poor PO intake
over last few weeks. She was seen in the Pain [**Hospital 9085**] clinic
and started on oxycontin and oxycodone for her back pain without
much relief. This morning her family felt that it was becoming
too difficult to manage her symptoms at home and felt it was
necessary to bring her to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7, HR 130, BP 132/66, RR19,
96% RA. While in the ED, the patient spiked to 102. UA was
negative. Blood and urine cultures were sent. An initial lactate
was 4.0. She received 4L IVF and her lactate improved to 2.3.
She was empirically treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A CT
scan was performed and did not show any drainable abscess from
her left axilla. The patient declined central access.


Past Medical History:
# Metastatic Melamoma - [**2162-2-8**], underwent an excisional
biopsy for what was felt to be a 7.2 thick, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level IV,
nonulcerated melanoma with 10 mitoses/m2 on her left shoulder.
There was evidence of lymphovascular invasion and a question of
perineural invasion. She underwent a wide local excision and
left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on [**2162-3-12**]
with pathology revealing melanoma in 4 sentinel lymph nodes with
evidence of extracapsular extension. She underwent a completion
left axillary node dissection on [**2162-3-26**] with
pathology showing no melanoma in 3 lymph nodes identified. She
received radiation therapy to the left axilla without
difficulty, completing in [**2162-5-9**]. She was placed on
interferon alpha-1a (Rebif) for multiple sclerosis on [**2162-7-6**]. She presented to Clinic on [**2163-1-26**] with multiple
nodules in the left axilla consistent with recurrence within the
radiation field. Subsequent head MRI showed multiple CNS
metastases. About to begin a phase II clinical trial of
sorafenib + temazolomide therapy for her CNS metastatic
melanoma.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosed in [**2154**], relapsing/remitting


Social History:
The patient lives with her husband and youngest son (age 17).
She has 2 older children ages 27 (daughter) and 25 (son). She
used to work as a teachers aid. She denies ETOH/smoking/drugs.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
The patient was admitted initially to the ICU for pain control
and presuemd septic physiology given tachycardia and elevated
lactate in the ED. She was continued on Vanc and Cefepime for
broad coverage given her left axillary wound and she remained
hemodynamically stable. She was continued on decadron for her
spinal met and dilaudid for pain control. As she remained
stable, she was transfered to OMED on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
further care.

OMED COURSE:
47 F w/ metastatic melanoma to lung, liver, brain, severe MS p/w
weakness and FTT.

# Pain Control - Used a tremendous amount of pain medicine (IV
dilaudid after first arriving to floor. Pain service was
consulted. Was initially put in IV dilaudid PCA. Final
acceptable pain regimen was 6-8 mg dilaudid q3h prn, Fentanyl
Patch 150 mcg/hr TP Q72H, methadone 10mg q8h, naproxen 500mg tid
prn, Lidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY, Neurontin
100qAM/100qPM/200qHS, and duloxetine 30mg daily. Additionally,
she underwent 5 fractions of palliative XRT to the pelvis and
spine. To counteract the effects of such a large pain medicine,
an aggressive bowel regimen was pursued. Monitored for narcosis
or depressed respiratory rate. Respirations were as low as [**11-20**]
at points, but was never pathological. Pt did deomnstrate some
nocturnal confusion (see below), for which ambien was
discontinued.  By time of discharge was stablized on an adequate
regimen with an aggressive bowel regimen given her high dose
narcotics.  Extended care facility has been provided with a
complete list.

# Confusion - Briefly noted early during inpatient course.
Initially thought to be most likely a side effect of
medications, but patient has known brain metastases. MRI brain
showed small new mets c/w melanoma, also stable demyelinating
disease. Ambian discontinued and confusion resolved.  Rad-onc
was then consulted to evaluated if whole brain radiation vs
cyberknife were appropriate for new metastases.  Given that she
was assymptomatic, no further treatment was pursued while
inpatient.  If patient does become symptomatic, she's encouraged
to contact radiation oncology as needed.

# Hypertension - No history of this in the past, but pt
persistently hypertensive on the floor (although BPs were taken
in legs because L arm with invasive melanoma, R arm with PICC,
so BP likely overestimated). Hypertension was likely exacerbated
by pain, so emphasized pain control to control BP as well. BPs's
decreased as pain has come under better control but ultimately
required continued metoprolol for BP control, discharged on this
medication.

# Metastatic Melanoma w/ axillary wound - Plan to continue chemo
with TMZ 200mg per m2 at later date, currently not able [**3-12**]
compromised health. Pan Spinal MRI showed intrinsic signal
abnormalities within the spinal cord secondary to multiple
sclerosis, as well as diffuse bony metastatic disease, with no
evidence of cord compression seen. S/p palliative XRT to spine
with great improvement in pain.  Wound care was consulted for
axillary wound and followed patient throughout stay.
Continued dexamethasone with taper for CNS mets.  Appreciate SW
consult, psych and pall care consults while inpatient.

# Intermittent Fever - Most likely related to malignancy.
Patient presented with fever in ED. Unclear source for an
infection, as CT showed no axillary abscess and all cultures
either negative or with NGTD. CXRs unrevealing for infiltrate.
After ICU stay, patient spiked again early [**2-23**] despite
vanc/cefepime and steroids. Cultures and radiology from that
date were also negative.  Patient completed 5 days of vancomycin
and a 7 day course of cefepime that was completed [**2-27**].  No
further antibiotics were given and no further evidence of
infection was found.

# Multiple Sclerosis - Last med was Rebif, d/c'ed in [**Month (only) **],
with no relapses. Previously on Avonex and Tysabri. Followed by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10835**]. Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10835**], would defer all MS rx at
this time while undergoing chemo; a last ditch option would be
MTX or cyclophosphamide. If undergoing brain XRT may need more
steroids as higher risk for MS relapse, but this is deferred to
outpatient follow-up if patient becomes symptomatic from new
brain metastases.

# Shoulder Pain - Complained of R shoulder pain that began the
day prior to admission following upper extremity physical
therapy.  Patient was consistent with muscle strain, which
patient thought was true as well.  No [**Last Name (un) 2043**] deformity.  EKG not
indicative of cardiac origin.  Abdominal exam benign with no
signs of radiating origin.  Maintained current pain regimen with
intermittantly complete relief.

# Anxiety - Psych consulted, continued prn BZD. Duloxetine added
for pain control.

# Code - DNR/DNI - discussed with patient at time of admission

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening lower back
pain, lower extremity weakness, and low grade fevers at home.
You were initially admitted to our ICU for close observation
because we were worried about an possible infection in your
bloodstream. However, no source for an infection was ever found
and you were then transferred to our oncology floor. You had
some intermittent fevers but again, no infection was found. The
fever may have been related to your malignancy.
.
We did an MRI of your spine which showed diffuse bony metastases
which were likely causing your pain and weakness. Our pain
service consulted and put you on an extensive pain control
regimen which lowered your pain to an acceptable level. We also
called our radiation oncologists, who provided you with a 5
session course of radiation to your spine and pelvis to further
control your pain.
.
At points you were confused, which was likely a side effect of
the large amount of pain medicine you were on. However, since
you have known brain metastases, we imaged your head to assess
for any change. This scan showed a few new small lesions that
were unlikely to be responsible for the confusion. We continued
to treat your cancer with a drug called temozolomide, as well as
with the palliative chemotherapy.
.
Our physical therapists worked with you and determined that you
need to go to rehab to work on regaining your strength.
.
Please take all of your medicines as prescribed. Please keep all
of your outpatient followup appointments. If you experience any
symptoms that disturb you, such as new weakness, fevers,chills,
please call your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the ER.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient 85 year old male with ileus Vs obstruction.

1) ? Ogiluies Syndrome - Talked with neuro and they state that
[**Month/Day/Year 10127**] from MS is very atypical.  GI saw patient will perform
colonoscopy later today since they felt possible mass in sigmoid
colon.  Will continue NG tube and rectal tube.  Will continue
IVF and keep patient NPO.  Will continue levo and flagyl for
prophylaxis of aspiration or perforation.  Will contiue
protonix.  Patient does not appear to be on any medications that
could cause [**Last Name (LF) 10127**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/c aricept for its GI interaction.
Patient to get fleet enema before c-scope

2) UTI - Patient has UTI from U/A, awaiting urine cultures.
Will continue levofloxacin.

3) Respiration - Patient now on facemask, xray suggests
atelectasis, most likely from abdominal distension.  Patient
swtiched from nasal cannula to faskmask bacause he had NGT
placed.  Will monitor I&O and check O2 sat.  If patient desats
will hold off on IVF and caonsider lasix and repeat CXR.  Will
get repeat CXR when patient more stable.  Will get echo to
assess patient's LVEF and and document if patient has AS.

4) MS - Currently patient not on any medications.  IF GI
performs colonoscopy and finds no obstructive mass as [**Last Name (un) 10128**] of
ileus, consider consulting neuro to see if this [**Last Name (un) 10127**] is
secondary to MS and if patient needs to be started on therapy
such as steroids.

5) Dementia - Will d/c aricept since it can have [**Last Name (un) 10127**] effects.

6) FEN - Will give patient IVF D51/2NS at 125cc/hr since patient
appears dry.  Patient tachycardic and elevated BUN (BUN/Cre
>20).  Patient with borderline low K, will repleat with fluids.
Will keep patient NPO.

7) PPx - Heparin SC, RISS, PPI

8) Communication - Son: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 10129**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10130**] he is the
Health care proxy.  Wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10131**]

9) Code: Currently full code, family will readdress in future.

10) The patient became progressively more tensely distended.  GI
felt that they could not safely sedate him from a respiratory
standpoint so he was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy.  Patient had colonic obstruction from a sigmoid mass
found at the time of surgery.  A sigmoid colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name **] and
end colostomy was performed.  An incidental appendectomy was
also performed in order to decompress the cecum.
[**Name (NI) **], pt. was monitored for an extended time in the
SICU for significant abdominal distention.  Symptoms resolved
and colostomy began to function properly.  Pt. was extubated and
sent to the floor where he regained his baseline mental status.
Speech and Swallow made recommendations regarding his diet and
consistency and he tolerated solid foods without aspiration.
Pt. discharged to rehab after direct discussion between the
patient's son, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the accepting rehab facility and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending surgeon regarding his continued care.

ED but was deferred to inpatient team for 48hr EEG per protocol.
However, prior to transfer pt began opening eyes spontaneously
and it was felt that cooling protocol was no longer necessary.
On admission vitals were: HR 47 RR 16 sat 100% vent BP 94/56
.
In the MICU, pt arrived on propofol for sedation. Propofol was
stopped temporarily and pt was opening eyes and nodding no but

Brief Hospital Course:
REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION:
69 y/o M history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11087**] at baseline, h/o aspiration
pna found unresponsive in nursing home possibly pulseless, s/p
CPR, intubated for airway protection now with eye opening and
head nodding but not clearly responding to commands.
.
#altered mental status ?????? presented with AMS but by time of
discharge pt was fully [**Last Name (Titles) 11087**] and conversational. Most likely
theory for episode of unresponsive was that pt had an episode of
sleep apnea causing significant hypoxia, or toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy. On the differential is UTI, see below, however
pt improved rapidly and it was felt that antibiotics were not
necessary at this time. Cardiogenic sources considered, but no
evidence of ischemia on ECG and only mildly elevated trops which
remained flat, vs symptomatic bradycardia (pt with HR in the
40-50 range on admission see bradycardia below) vs stroke (but
head CT negative for acute process). Metabolic disturbances must
be considered but electrolytes wnl. DDx includes
seizure/postictal unresponsiveness however this was felt to be
less likely. In short, it was felt that his episode of
unresponsiveness was [**1-14**] sleep apnea. Pt with history of sleep
apnea but noncompliance with cpap recommended in the past. Was
noted to desat to 70% overnight in the ICU which immediately
resolved on waking him up. Pt was not requiring oxygen at time
of discharge although it would be suggested that he use oxygen
at night. He needs to have an outpatient sleep study and more
aggressive control of his sleep apnea.

#bacteruria - urine growing GNRs (proteus), large leuks however
only 4 WBC and no nitrites. Pt has a chronic indwelling
suprapubic catheter and noted to have frequent instances of
bacteruria - has grown proteus, enterococcus, morganella, and a
variety of other species in the past. Appears he is most
frequently growing proteus. Per previous infectious disease
note, plan has been not to treat unless pt had symptoms (often
develops urgency). Pt denied symptoms at this point and because
his mental status was rapidly improving we did not initiate
antibiotic therapy at this time. Still, pt did receive
vanc/levoquin in the ED (x1 dose) and improvement could have
been [**1-14**] antibiotic administration, although this is less
likely. Should follow up on speciation/sensitivities of urine
culture from this admission. He has a chronic
Would recommend treatment with antibiotics should pt
decompensate - strongly consider urinary source - please see
sensitivities under ""results"" section of DC paperwork.
.
#Hyponatremia - sodium of 131 on presentation. Pt was initially
resuscitated with 4L NS. Sodium immediately normalized and
remained wnl.
.
#elevated lactate - p/w lactate of 2.6 trended down to 1.1 day
of discharge. Pt did recieve >6L IVF which likely contributed to
improvement. Assuming pt was truly pulseless (not definitively
known) this lactate likely reflects hypoxia to tissues in the
setting of poor circulation. Pt was able to maintain normal
blood pressure and lactate elevation resolved.
.
#bradycardia - initially found with HR of 45-50. No evidence of
cardiac ischemia. This resolved once pt was off sedation. Pt was
monitored on telemetry without events.
.
#history of aspiration pneumonia - NPO, tube feeds and meds via
Gtube. Continued PPI.
.
#hypothyroidism ?????? tsh normal. continued levothyroxine
.
#nutrition ?????? continued home tube feeds with free water flushes
prn.

#MS - at baseline is fully [**Month/Day (2) 11087**] although cannot move any
part of the body except his face. Pt to follow up with neurology
as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent
hospitalization. You presented after being found unresponsive,
and you were intubated because of inability to protect your
airway. You became more alert and we extubated you. You regained
orientation and were fully alert and conversational by the time
of discharge. We thought this unresponsive episode was from low
oxygen because of your obstructive sleep apnea at night. It is
very important that you schedule a sleep study and use CPAP or
whatever treatment is recommended.

Followup Instructions:
The following are appointments that you already have scheduled.
It is very important that you also schedule appointments with
ENT, neurology, and to have a sleep study. Please call

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bladder carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
female who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 649**] with acute renal failure.  She was taken to
the Operating Room and found to have bilateral ureteral
obstruction at the base of her bladder from presumably a
bladder primary carcinoma.  This was biopsied and it was a
little indecisive as to wether this was a bladder primary or
a gynecologic primary cancer.  Either way, the
recommendations were to proceed to the Operating Room for an
anterior exenteration.  This is what she did and this is what
this admission is for.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis; hypertension;
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus; breast cancer, status
post lumpectomy and radiation in [**2174**] with Tamoxifen therapy;
chronic renal insufficiency; history of an upper
gastrointestinal bleed with gastritis; history of recent
aspiration pneumonia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Celexa 40 mg p.o. q. day;

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] preoperatively on [**2180-6-8**].  She received consultation from the enterostomal nurse
in preparation for going to the Operating Room the following
day.  She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2180-6-9**]
where she underwent anterior exenteration with ileal loop
urinary diversion.  She did well in the Operating Room and
was taken to the Intensive Care Unit intubated
postoperatively.  She had a vaginal pack in place along with
the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain, two nephroureteral stents, bilateral
nephrostomy tubes which were present preoperatively, a
pulmonary arterial line, an arterial line, an nasogastric
tube and peripheral intravenous lines.  In the Intensive Care
Unit she did quite well and she was kept on Ancef and Flagyl
antibiotics for 72 hours.  Her pain was controlled with
intermittent Morphine pulses and she remained intubated for
two days postoperatively.  Her x-rays that were performed
postoperatively revealed both ureteral stents to be in the
mid to proximal ureters.  Her bilateral nephrostomy tubes
were left to gravity and were draining urine.  On
postoperative day #2 the patient was extubated and she was
oxygenating and ventilating well.  She received aggressive
chest physiotherapy and continued to improve from a
respiratory standpoint.  She was still kept without eating
with an nasogastric tube in place.  She was on Zantac
prophylaxis.  Her vaginal packing was removed on
postoperative day #2.  At this point her right internal
jugular catheter was changed to a triple lumen with a port
saved for parenteral nutrition should she need it.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit to the floor in stable condition.  She
continued to receive intravenous fluids and was not eating as
she had not passed gas yet.  On postoperative day #5, she had
had a small bowel movement and her diet was advanced to sips
of clear liquids.  She continued to do well and was continued
on her subcutaneous heparin.  Physical therapy saw her and
began to mobilize her.  On postoperative day #6 the patient
underwent bilateral antegrade nephrostograms and she was
found to have prompt drainage from the right kidney through
the dilated right ureter into her ileal loop.  The left side,
which is her better-functioning kidney did drain but at a
slower rate when compared to the right side.

With this knowledge and the nephrostograms, both percutaneous
nephrostomy tubes were clamped on postoperative day #6.  The
patient developed no pain in the upcoming 12 hours, and on
postoperative day #7, the right nephrostomy tube was removed.
There was no leakage from this site and a dressing was
applied.  The left nephrostomy tube remained capped and the
patient was tolerating this quite well.  The decision was
made to leave this tube in place as this is her healthier
kidney and providing most of her renal function.  In the
event that she should develop left flank pain it could easily
be uncapped and placed to gravity drainage.

By postoperative day #7 the patient was out of bed, and
working with the physical therapist.  By postoperative day #8
her rehabilitation bed was ready at [**Hospital1 **] Facility in
[**Location (un) 246**] and she was transferred to rehabilitation in stable
condition.  The morning of postoperative day #8 her
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed as it was draining small
amounts of fluid and the creatinine from this fluid revealed
it was consistent with peritoneal fluid and not urine.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9, heartrate
84, blood pressure 136/74, respiratory rate 18 breaths per
minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  She is in no
acute distress.  Her heart is regular rate and rhythm.  Her
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with decreased
effort.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender and slightly obese.
Her midline incision is clean, dry and intact with staples.
Her right lower quadrant urostomy stoma is pink with clear
yellow urine draining.  Her left flank nephrostomy tube is
capped and the site is clean, dry and intact.  Her previous
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site is covered with a dressing and
intact.  Her extremities are warm and well perfused with
trace edema bilaterally.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  All of her preoperative medications
without change as well as stoma supplies.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  [**Hospital3 13268**] in [**Location (un) 246**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient's midline abdominal
staples can be removed on postoperative day #14 and
Steri-Strips applied.

1.  Nutrition - The patient is advanced to a house diet, but
her intake has been somewhat questionable, secondary to
decreased appetite.  When the patient was transferred here
from her rehabilitation facility she was receiving peripheral
parenteral nutrition.  There may be need for this in the
future if she does not continue to improve with her oral
intake.

2.  Genitourinary - The patient's left nephrostomy tube
should remain capped at all times.  Should the patient
develop left flank pain or have minimal output from her loop
for an extended period of time, the left nephrostomy could be
placed back to gravity drainage but we would like to keep
this capped in an effort to have it removed at the
postoperative visit.  The patient's ileal loop urostomy
appliance was changed on [**2180-6-16**] and extensive
instructions have been left in her chart for additional
changes on her Page 2 summary completed by the enterostomal
therapy nurse.

3.  Follow up - The patient should follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**] in two weeks time for possible left nephrostomy tube
removal in the office.  This is scheduled through his office
at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6445**].

ADDENDUM:  Addendum to her discharge medications.  Please add
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. three times per day.

Addendum to her hospital course.  Number 3 would be
cardiovascular.  The patient was found to be hypertensive and
tachycardic postoperatively and was begun on intravenous
Lopressor.  This was converted to Lopressor orally 25 mg p.o.
three times per day, and she did well from this standpoint.
She was borderline hypertensive on admission and was
continued on this Lopressor at the time of discharge.

Number 5 on hospital course will be non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus issues.  The patient's fingersticks
remained in the 110 to 150 range she was in house, and she
received subcutaneous insulin according to the sliding-scale
as needed.  Please continue her on the sliding-scale at

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14893**] is a 62 year old male transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for
ICU level care after a dx of severe R sided PNA. He presented to
the OSH today from home after one day of increased work of
breathing, SOB, lethargy (per wife), change in MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**],
and decreased po intake. He has a history of PNA and has had
similar presentations in the past. At the OSH, a CXR showed a
near white out of the R lung. He was noted to be hypoxic (82% on
RA), tachypneic (23), and tachycardic (109). He was given IVF
for an episode of transient hypotension that resolved. He was
also started on levo/flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia,
and subsequently switched to broader coverage with
Vanc/Meropenem after cultures returned negative. He did not
require intubation and was never on pressors. He has remained
hemodynamically stable and his breathing treatments have
decreased in frequency. He subjectively feels better and was
transferred from the MICU in stable condition.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2107-1-20**] 10:56 AM
Since most recent film, there has been interval placement of a
right-sided PICC catheter with its tip in the mid SVC. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax. Underlying reticular nodular
disease within the lungs is stable as is alveolar consolidative
process within the right mid and lower lung fields and
retrocardiac region. Right apical scarring is stable in
appearance. Large amount of stool within the bowel is again
identified.

IMPRESSION:
Right-sided PICC with tip in mid SVC. No evidence of
pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.

#) Pulmonary Infiltrate: Patient admitted with elevated lactate,
leuckocytosis and hypotension suspected pneumonia/UTI
empirically started on Vancomycin/Meropenem while awaiting
cultures/sensitivities. Current thought is that pneumonia may be
either aspiration or CAP. Patient with underlying brochiectasis
predisposing patient to infection. Patient has not had a CT to
assess interstitial lung disease. Patient's imaging did improve
with diuretics suggesting some underlying CHF incited by
respiratory condition.  Given that the patient's cultures were
negative, tghe broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and
he was discharged on a 10-day dcourse of Levofloxacin.
.
#. ILD/COPD: Pt has history of ILD/COPD/Emphysema. On
Albuterol/Atrovent at home. Goal oxygen saturation is low 90's.
Patient was continued on his home regimen and maintained
appropriate oxygen saturation while on the floor.

tracheal-bronchial atresia and subglottic stenosis with history
of recurrent pneumonia, s/p tracheostomy in [**2100**], s/p
unsuccessful intrabronchial stent placement in [**2101-12-29**].
She has been lost to follow up with us since [**2101**]. In the mean
time she was being seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12517**] [**Name (STitle) 16991**] at the Mass eye and
ENT infirmary. Since [**2101**] she had three tracheostomy tube
changed with laser ablation of the subglottic lesion. She had
the tracheostomy tube removed between [**2104**] and [**2105**] and has also
weaned off the oxygen.

Over the last three months she has been progressively more short
of breath with worsening stridor. She has had three pneumonia
over the last year, never needing admission to hospital. Treated
with Solu-Medrol and antibiotics including a antifungal. She has
also developed increasing DOE- she could climb one flight of
stairs, now she has to go very slow. The voice is more horse,
and noisy. She finds herself tired and fatigued. Cough is
productive of brown phlegm.

She underwent a scheduled rigid brochoscopy with balloon
dilation to her tracheal stenosis. Subsequently, she had
difficulty after extubation in the PACU. She develop stridor and
became agitated. She appear hypoxic and she was re-intubated,
which was proven to be difficult. She transciently became
bradycardic for <30 seconds, which improved with bag-mouth
ventalation. She recieved dexamethasone 5mg x 1 dose post-op.
Bronchoscopy was performed after re-intubation and no obvious
source of stridor was found. She is now being transfer to the
TSICU for further management.

CXR [**2110-8-7**]: AP single view of the chest was obtained with
patient in
semi-upright position.  The patient is intubated, the ETT is
seen to terminate in the trachea, 5 cm above the level of the
carina.  No pneumothorax or any other placement-related
complication can be identified.  An NG tube has been assed and
reaches well below the diaphragm including its side port.
External instruments and lines are overlying the right apical
area, but there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal
infiltrate anywhere in the lungs, and the lateral pleural
sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures grossly within normal
limits on this single view AP chest examination.  The next
preceding chest examination of this patient in our records is
dated [**2102-1-10**] and did not show any acute pulmonary
abnormalities.

CXR [**2110-8-10**]
FINDINGS:  The right IJ line has been removed.  There is no
focal infiltrate.
There is blunting of the right CP angle, consistent with small
effusion.
There is a linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm that does
not conform
to the expected position of the stomach and is unclear if this
represents free
air.  This finding was called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13651**] at 4:20 p.m. on
[**2110-8-10**] after
noticing this finding at 4:18 p.m.  Recommend clinical
correlation and

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**] is a 34 yo F w/ extensive PMH included right lung
hypoplasia and multiple tracheostomy tubes with subsequent
tracheomalacia and subglotic stenosis who presented for an
outpatient elective rigid bronchoscopy with ballon dilation that
was complicated on extubation by likely laryngospasm with
stridor and reintubation who was reextubated successfully.

#Tracheo-bronchial atresia and Laryngospasm- patient had
striodor and respiratory distress following extubation from the
balloon dilation. A flexible bronchoscopy done in the PACU
showed some subglottic edema and the stenosis was patent.  She
was reintubated and admitted to the ICU.  There she received a
RIJ central line for access and ENT was consulted who performed
a fiberopstic evaluation where they did not see any evidence of
stenosis and it was felt to be most consistent with
laryngospasm.  She was treated with 24 hours of decadron and
then successfully extubated.  She was monitored by IP and will
require follow-up with them in the future to reassess her
hoarseness.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital after you had a
procedure to open up your trachea and you had some difficulty
breathing after the procedure. The breathing tube was placed
back in your throat and you were admitted to the ICU for a
couple of days and had the breathing tube removed. It is felt
that the problem breathing was likely due to a spasm of the
muscles in your throat.  You are now safe to go home.

We made the following changes to your medications:
Prednisone 60mg on [**9-28**], 40mg on [**9-21**], 20mg on [**7-20**], 10mg on [**7-17**]
Bactrim 1 tablet daily

Followup Instructions:
Your pulmonologist will call you for a follow up appointment in
3 to 4 weeks.

ADMISSION ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
A/P: 79 year old right-handed woman (currently using left
hand-only because of R paralysis due to MS), with secondary
progressive MS (R hemiparesis from MS for 25 years), DM who
presented with L visual field cut, dysarthria at 10:30am,
followed by L neglect, L hemiparesis; s/p IV tPA at 12:25pm at
OSH; transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was found to have a L
neglect, R gaze preference (she can cross midline on L gaze)
dysarthria, L facial weakness, L visual field cut, and L
hemiparesis besides baseline R hemiparesis from MS. [**Last Name (Titles) 18246**] 27. A
CTA head and neck showed an extensive R MCA territory stroke and
occlusion of R carotid artery. After discussion with family of
further procedures, family opted for IA tPA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
NEURO: The patient was transferred to the angiogram suite with
the IR team where she underwent IA TPA.  She was admitted to the
neurology ICU under Attending Physician [**Name9 (PRE) 18249**] [**Name9 (PRE) **].
Follow-up head CT the next morning revealed extensive edema nad
midline shift with possible contrast extravasation versus
hemorrhagic conversion.  In conversation with the family, they
brought the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy documentation to the
attention of the medical team who requested that the patient be
made comfort measures only given her poor prognosis.  She was
therefore transferred to the floor on a morphine drip and
expired at 21:16.

In accordance with the patient's wishes, the MS tissue bank was
[**Hospital 653**] prior to her death regarding brain donation.
Unfortunately given funding constraints donation was no longer
possible out-of-state.  Alternative tissue banks in [**State 4565**],
[**State 18250**], [**State 12000**], and [**State 350**] were [**Name (NI) 653**], however
given her medical issues of stroke and multiple sclerosis her
brain was not appropriate for donation.  Therefore, in
accordance with her healthcare proxy documentation, her brain
was designated to undergo autopsy for donation to research and
education purposes at the request of her family.  Pathology was

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right forearm skin biopsy.


History of Present Illness:
33F with history of multiple sclerosis and recent admission in
[**2177-1-27**] for fevers, fatigue, and wheezing, presenting with
fevers and pain, as well as progressive weakness and
numbness/tingling in the arm and leg. During her last admission,
she was admitted for FUO and had an extensive workup, including
TTE, multiple blood cultures, autoimmune workup, and multiple
imaging studies. Multiple etiologies of her (then) low-grade
fevers and asthma were entertained, including Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**],
eosinophilic pneumonia, ABPA, and infectious etiologies.
.
She was started on high dose steroids with improvement in
wheezing and fevers; she was discharged with appropriate follow
up. She was seen by an OSH rheumatologist who diagnosed her with
Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] clinically; her steroids were tapered to 80mg
daily, and he started her on azathioprine. She took these
medications for 10 days, but on or about [**3-22**] was seen by a
pulmonologist, who did not feel her symptoms were related to
vasculitis, and apparently instructed her to discontinue her
prednisone.  Within a few days, she started feeling more pain,
and her fevers started two days prior to admission. The day
prior to admission, she noted diarrhea and dizziness. She is
frustrated with the different opinions she has received from all
different providers.
.
In the ED, triage vitals were T106F, BP 123/101, HR 165, RR 16,
Sat 100%. She was given 3L normal saline, morphine for pain,
Zofran for nausea, Tylenol and Motrin, at which time her fever
came down. Blood and urine cultures were sent, and she was
admitted to the floor for further workup.
.
At the time of admission, she is complaining of chills, body
pain, including nerve and muscle pain in her right arm and right
leg, as well as a burning pain in her left hand and left toes.
She also has a pain in her upper back. She denies cough,
dysuria, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sore throat, neck pain,
headache, and other signs of infection.

by
[**2177-3-31**] [**2177-3-31**] [**2177-4-8**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. ZIMAROWSKI/mrr??????
Previous biopsies:    [**Numeric Identifier 18565**]  GASTRIC AND COLON BXS (2).
.
DIAGNOSIS:
Skin, right forearm, punch biopsy:
Perivascular granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation with
scattered eosinophils, focal vascular injury, and associated
polarizable foreign  material.
.
Note:  The combined pathologic features are unusual.  There are
granulomatous areas comprised of histiocytes, neutrophils with
some leukocytoclasia, and eosinophils (some within
interstitium).  The granulomas form palisades about polarizable
foreign material and vessels involving the dermis and subcutis.
Some foci show vascular injury consistent with granulomatous
vasculitis.
.
The differential diagnosis includes infection.  Special stains
([**Last Name (un) 18566**], AFB, PAS, GMS, and gram) are negative for organisms,
however, culture  is a more sensitive method to detect
organisms.  A recent biopsy was taken for cultures.   If
infection is excluded the combined findings of small palisading
granulomas with neutrophils, eosinophils and focal vasculitis
are suggestive of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] (allergic) granulomatosis.  The
polarizable foreign material and history of scar / trauma at
this site suggests the possibility of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**]
granulomatosis Koebnerizing a site of prior injury.

The findings are not typical of foreign body granulomas which
would show more giant cells and lack neutrophils.  Rarely
palisading granulomas may be observed as a reaction to foreign
material, but again, they usually lack neutrophils.  Sarcoidosis
(which may Koebnerize)  is considered, however, the granulomas
are not typical of ""naked"" granulomas of sarcoid.  While
neutrophils may be observed in sarcoidosis, the number of
neutrophils in this specimen would be unusual.  Lastly the
histologic differential diagnosis for disorders that may show
Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] type of granulomas includes Wegener's
granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid
arthritis, however, these disorders usually lack eosinophils.
Clinical-pathologic correlation is recommended.
.
Clinical: Punch biopsy right forearm-4 mm- patient with fever of
unknown origin to 106, mild eosinophilia, arthralgias, history
of asthma. Biopsy to help team determine if ? vasculitis.
Clinically appears to be an erythematous scar with some soft
tissue swelling.
Gross: The specimen is received in a formalin-filled container,
labeled with the patient's name, ""[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 2048**]"" and the
[**Hospital 228**] medical record number. The specimen consists of a 4 mm
punch biopsy of tan-white skin excised to a depth of 0.5 cm. The
epidermal surface is grossly unremarkable after fixation. The
margin is inked blue. The specimen is bisected and entirely
submitted in cassette A.


Brief Hospital Course:
33F h/o multiple sclerosis, recently diagnosed clinically with
churgg-[**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome and being treated with oral steroids,
who presents with high fevers, diffuse muscle spasms, and R LE
weakness, in the setting of discontinuation of oral steroids.
.
# fever / vasculitis / churgg [**Doctor Last Name **] disease - initial ddx
includes acute infection, but was felt more likely to represent
flare of underlying vasculitis.  pt was empirically covered with
broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc, cefepime) and restarted on
oral prednisone 80mg qdaily.  CXR, blood, urine cultures were
obtained and unremarkable.   she continued to spike high fevers
(>104) despite antibiotics, cooling blanket, acetaminophen,
NSAIDs.
.
with high fever, despite IVF, her heart rate would increase up
to 170bpm, prompting breif ICU transfer.  She improved with
tylenol, antibiotics, fluids, and continuation of steroids.
.
she was evaluated by the rheumatology service, who recommended
initially continuing prednisone and azathioprine, while
attempting to obtain pathologic confirmation of her diagnosis,
then recommended discontinuing azathioprine.  biopsy of the
lungs and sural nerve were considered, but pt declined lung
biopsy given her vocation as a singer, and EMG was unremarkable
in the setting of R LE weakness, thus this was felt to be low
yeild.  dermatology was consulted to perform a right forearm
skin biopsy in the bed of a former scar, which ultimately was
felt to be supportive of, but not definitive for, churgg [**Doctor Last Name **]
disease.   the patients hosiptal course was complicated by
severe muscle spasms and neuropathic pain, attributed to her
multiple sclerosis, and treated as below.
.
after review of the final pathology results, with rheumatology,
pt's clinical symptoms and pathology were felt consistent with a
diagnosis of vasculitis, specifically churgg [**Doctor Last Name **].  she was
treated with high dose steroids iv x5d as below for optic
neuritis, then transitioned to oral prednisone 60mg on [**2177-4-6**]
without difficulty.  the patient was discharged home on a
regimen of oral prednisone 60mg po qdaily without taper, with
instructions to follow-up with her primary rheumatologist on
[**2177-4-15**], to discuss initiation of methotrexate or cytoxan.  she
was otherwise discharged on calcium, vitamin d, bactrim, and
fosamax.
.
.
# multiple sclerosis / optic neuritis / muscle spasms - pt was
evaluated by the neurology service given symptoms of right foot
weakness, shoulder, lower extremity, and rib muscle spasms which
were felt to be likely related to her history of multiple
sclerosis.  EMG testing was performed to see if the new RLE
weakness could be attributed to a mononeuritis (which would
suggest vasculitis), but the findings were felt more consistent
with a peripheral neuropathy versus a central process likely MS
versus pain/cooperation.
.
the patient then developed right eye pain consistent with prior
episodes of optic neuritis, for which she was evalauted by
opthalmology service, and felt consistent with optic neuritis.
she was treated with methylprenisolone 1000 mg IV Q24H x5d
starting [**2177-4-1**] with resolution of her symptoms.  MRI of the
head/orbit was obtained which revealed stable appearance of
""U-shaped focus of FLAIR-hyperintensity in the right
perirolandic subcortical white matter, without discrete
abnormality of the overlying grey matter, when compared with
previous examinations dating back to [**2174-9-11**]. No new foci of
abnormal signal intensity or enhancement are identified to
suggest progression of demyelinating disease.""  There was no
evidence of abnormal signal intensity or enhancement involving
the optic nerves, tracts or chiasm.""
.
her hospital course was otherwise complicated by severe muscle
spasms, and neuropathic pain, which were treated initially with
iv ativan, dilaudid, and ultimately transitioned to oral
dilaudid, valium, baclofen, tizanidine, and klonipin per
neurology and pain service recommendation.  she was also
restarted on topamax 50mg po BID, and should increase to 100mg
PO BID within the next week if she tolerates the present dose.
she was instructed to follow-up with her outpatient chronic pain
provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] consider baclofen pump insertion in the future
should her pain persist, at [**Hospital1 112**].  she was evaluated by physical
therapy, and discharged home with plan for outpatient physical
therapy.
.
Pt was otherwise discharged home on oral regimen of steroids as
above, with instructions to follow-up with her neurologist, and
to coordinate discussion between rheumatology and neurology
regarding anti-inflammatory regimen.  She was also encouraged to
consolidate her medical care into a single institution to
facilitate care.
.
.
# hyperglycemia - pt with likely steroid induced diabetes, she
was admitted on a regimen of lantus and metformin, which was
continued at discharge.

Pertinent Results:

TTE [**2112-9-4**]:

Marked tachycardiac (HR>140/min).
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Basal segments
contract best. No left ventricular thormbus is identified, but
apical segments are not well visualized. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w
diffuse process (tachycardia, toxin, metabolic, multivessel CAD,
etc.). Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Based on [**2100**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

[**9-4**] CXR:

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-30**] through [**9-3**]:

ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric tube are
in standard
placements, respectively.

There has been no change over 48 hours in the severe
infiltrative abnormality
predominantly in the lower lungs. This is probably pulmonary
edema, cardiac
or otherwise. Heart is top normal size and there is persistent
but mild
distention of mediastinal veins and a small right pleural
effusion. No
pneumothorax.







Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 y/o female with a medical history significant for
MS, prior PE, recurrent pneumonias, who was admitted on [**2112-8-30**]
from her NH with hypotension and tachycardia.  Initial VS at the
NH were a BP of 106/60 and HR 118.  Her CXR upon admission
demonstrated bibasilar opacities consistent with infiltrate vs.
effusion with pulmonary edema, so she was given Ceftriaxone and
Metronidazole to cover possible CAP +/- aspiration PNA.
On [**2112-8-31**], the patient triggered for tachycardia with HR in the
140s.  Initial labs were significant for a normal D-dimer,
normal BNP, and normal cardiac enzymes.  Her heart rate
stabilized with fluid boluses; however she triggered again on
[**9-1**] with a HR of 150s and BP of 90/p, necessitating transfer to
the ICU. She was given adenosine with some improvement in her
heart rate.  She had evidence of volume overload by exam and
with a markedly elevated BNP, so she was initially treated with
lasix boluses as well as a diltizem drip for her tachycardia,
however the diltiazem was discontinued after consultation with
Cardiology, given her rhythm was consistent with sinus
tachycardia. An echocardiogram demonstrated acute systolic heart
failure, with a depressed EF of 20% and severe LV global
hypokinesis, consistent with a diffuse process (toxin,
metabolic, multivessal CAD, Takosubo's cardiomyopathy).  The
patient was intubated emergently overnight on [**2112-9-3**] due to
impending hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was continued on
lasix for diuresis, however was begun on vasopressor support
with levophed and dobumatine for persistent hypotension
secondary to cardiogenic shock.  Extensive work-up failed to
reveal an etiology for her acute systolic CHF.  The patient
failed to improve over the next few days and continued to have
persistent hypotension.
After discussion with the patient's husband and family regarding
her poor prognosis, it was decided that aggressive support would
be withdrawn on [**2112-9-6**].  The patient expired on [**2112-9-6**], at
approximately 220 AM.

ketones.  An arterial blood gas showed a PO2 of 181, a PCO2
of 25, and a pH of 7.28.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
effusions.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 36-year-old gentleman with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and diabetic
ketoacidosis, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The hematemesis was likely from a small [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears
from the nausea and vomiting.  The diabetic ketoacidosis was
likely from a poor diet and insulin compliance secondary to
depression and social situation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was was guaiac-positive at
admission.  A nasogastric tube was placed, and NGT lavage showed
a small amount of red blood that quickly cleared.  However, his
hematocrit throughout this admission was stable in the high 30s
and low 40s.

He was given intravenous fluids, potassium, and insulin and had
his sugars monitored to maintain fingerstick blood glucoses
between 140 and 180.

He was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit from [**2181-12-31**] to [**2182-1-1**] when he was transferred to the
floor on the evening of [**2182-1-1**] with a corrected
anion gap of 11.  He continued to remain stable on the floor
and had a change of his diabetes regimen for better control.
He was instructed on his new regimen by the medical team,
then Endocrine consultation from [**Last Name (un) **], and a diabetic
teaching nurse.  He was discharged with followup at the

Cardiac Cath [**2175-8-7**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis
with a patent prior RCA stent. The LMCA was a short vessel with
almost dual ostia. The LAD was heavily calcified proximally and
had a proximal 40-50% stenosis and diffuse plaquing to 50% in
the mid-distal vessel. The LCx had heavy calcification. There
was mild diffuse plaquing throughout to 30-40% with tortouous
terminal branches of a single major OM. The RCA had diffuse
plaquing throughout with mild in-stent restenosis of the
mid-distal RCA [**Doctor First Name 10788**] stent with a 35% distal edge restnosis. The
distal RCA was tortuous. The origin of the R PDA (<2 mm diameter
by QCA) had a 70% stenosis. There were multiple RPLs.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic systolic
arterial hypertension (SBP 189 mm Hg) and moderately elevated LV
filling pressure(LVEDP 19 mm Hg).
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse
atherosclerosis.
2. Patent prior mid-RCA [**Doctor First Name 10788**] bare metal stent.
3. Severe systemic systolic arterial hypertension.
4. Moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
.
.
ECHO [**2175-8-7**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >65%) The estimated cardiac
index is normal(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-6-10**],
biventricular systolic function remains preserved. Borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo Female with Type I DM who presented with hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar state after her insulin pump malfunctioned. There
did not appear to be an infectious cause that precipitated this.
.
# CAD: The patient had known CAD, with known PCI in [**2166**] to RCA.
Since then no cardiac cath. Stress (P MIBI) in [**6-7**] and Echo in
[**6-7**] were normal (with the exception of focal calcifications of
the aortic arch). The patient has been chest pain free and on
this admission but was found to have EKG changes in V5/V6 TWI /
ST depressions and mildly elevated troponins. Given the
patient's high risk (known CAD, multiple risk factors, age, +
enzymes, EKG changes) and TIMI score of 5, it was felt she would
benefit from early angiography for NSTEMI. She was started on
aspirin 325 daily and heparin IV. Given the high risk and STE in
aVR leading to ? LM disease, plavix was held in case CABG would
be needed. Her lopressor was increased to 25mg po bid. Her lipid
panel came back normal. She received a cardiac catheterization
on [**2175-8-7**] which did show diffuse disease (see report) but
nothing that was deemed intervenable. Her post-precedure course
was unremarkable. Given her MS and difficulty ambulating (she
currently uses a wheelchair), she requested transfer to rehab
and was evaulated by PT/OT. She was discharged on [**2175-8-9**].
.
#hyperglycemia: She has had DM typeI from age 18. The gap was
closed, and the cause was felt to be due to a malfunctioning
insulin pump. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and the patient was advised
to restart her pump after the catheterization procedure. Until
that time, she was covered with sliding scale insulin. Her pump
was restarted on [**2175-8-8**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **], her sensitivity for
correction was switched from 1:45 to 1:30. She was discharged
after monitoring her pump to ensure it was properly functioning.
.
#skin lesion - The patient was maintained on an antibiotic
regimen (keflex) recommend by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21210**] for possible
cellulitis.
.
#burn - The patient had sustained superficial skin burns to her
back in an accident about one week prior to admission. She was
given routine wound care for this.
.
#Multiple sclerosis - The patient was maintained on outpatient
meds including meds for neurogenic bladder.
.
#Depression - The patient was maintained on outpatient meds.

Charcot foot deformities), peripheral vascular disease status
post right popliteal-->DP bypass from [**6-6**], two-vessel coronary
disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed
to RCA, who was initially transfered to the cardiac ICU
intubated, on pressors, with balloon pump in place. She was
eventually able to be weaned off the balloon pump and
ventilator, however she showed worsening respiratory status
shortly thereafter with increasing oxygen demand and increased
work of breathing.  On day 6 of her admission, she developed a
spontaneous pneumothorax which made postive pressure ventilation
difficult without re-intubation.  On day 7 of her admission, her
CXR showed widespread bilateral airspace opacities which were
worse on the left side than previous images.  Family meeting was
held to discuss the patient's worsening resp status and she was
changed to DNR/DNI status by her HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] PCP was notified as
well.  On the evening of day 7, she desated to the 80s and
became hemodynamically unstable.  Her family was called and pt

Abd XR [**3-10**]: A large amount of free intraperitoneal air is seen,
which is consistent with patient's history of second day after
operation. The bowel gas pattern appears within normal limits.

CTA [**3-13**]: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is a small
right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. There
is free air within the abdomen consistent with the patient's
postoperative state.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent dx hysteroscopy, D&C, dx laparoscopy which was
converted to operative laporatomy secondary to copious adhesions
and L endometrioma on [**2170-3-7**].  As noted in HPI, pt initally
presented secondary to chronic pelvic pain and irregular
bleeding.  Pt tolerated the operation well - see operative note
for full details.

1) Pulm - on POD #0, pt received 8 mg Morphrine for adequate
pain control and a drop in RR rate to 6 when asleep was noted.
Her O2 saturation was 92% on room air. Pt was tranferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for close monitoring.  Apnea resolved and was thought to be
likely related to strong response to narcotics with possible
component of MS playing a role. CXR at this time was clear and
O2 sat increased to 98% on RA.
-on POD #5, pt complained of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea.
Her vital signs were stable and O2 saturation 100%RA.  EKG was
checked wnl and CTA was negative for pulmonary embolus.  She had
just had a fever to 100.7 and urine and blood cultures were
rechecked and negative to date. WBC 4.5.  Further CTA identified
some atelectasis and pt was encouraged to ambulate and use IS.
Rib pain resolved later in the day.

2) Fever - Pt had temp to 101.9 on POD #2 and temp 100.7 on POD
#5. Blood and urine cultures/Urinalysis were checked at both
these episodes and were negative.  As noted above, CXR was wnl.
In addition, on POD#5 w/u for PE was performed which was
negative.  Incision was C/D/I without erythema or exudate
throughout entire hospital course.  Pt did have pain control
issues and had not been ambulating or using IS as much as
recommended.  CTA did show atelectasis and likely this was a
source of fever. Clear etiology not identified. Pt remained
afebrile after POD #5 without further treatment and increased in
ambulation.

3) Neuro/MS - Pts neurologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] aware of
hospitalization.  Pt was evaluated by physical therapy and found
to be stable - no acute or home PT needs. Pt continued her home
dose of Rebif while in house. No signs of MS flare.

4) GI - On POD #2 pt experienced increased abdominal distention
and pain and nausea.  KUB was not consistent with post op ileus.
 Pt was made NPO/bowel rest.  No signs of infection. Pt Hct was
stable. Nausea resolved spontaneouly with bowel rest and was
likely do to flatus buildup. Pt was advanced to clear liquids in
afternoon and tolatered well.  After that episode pt's diet was
advanced to general and pt tolerated well. Pt was later started
on Colace to help counter constipation.

5) Pain -  Pain control was an issue with this patient. Pain was
initally controlled with low doses of Morphine though pt was
very drowsy with Morphine and did not find the control adequate.
Given previous episode of apnea with high amounts of Morphine,
pt was given only 1 mg q4-6 hours prn. OTC Tylenol.  Pt was then
transitioned to Toradol once Hct was deemed to be stable in
order to better control pain. Once course of Toradol expired, pt
was tried on trial of Percocet. She tolerated Percocet well and
Motrin was added - no signs of allergy to Percocet, about which
pt was concerned. Chronic pain consultation was undertaken and
OTC Motrin and Percocet was recommended for 2-3 days then prn
medication. Pts pain was controlled well on Percocet and Motrin
on discharge. Pt to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1004**] [**Name (STitle) **] and it will
be deemed if further appointments with chronic pain will be
necessary as outpt.

6) Dispo - pt was discharged home in stable condition, afebrile,
pain controlled, tol po without N/V, ambulating, voiding on POD
#7.

- [**2166-3-31**] Urine culture: Pending.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 59 year-old female with IDDM, seizure disorder, and
multiple sclerosis transferred from nursing home for acute
respiratory distress and found to be in septic shock.

# Septic shock: Patient borderline hypotensive with fever to
104, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. Right IJ CVL
placed for CVP monitoring as well as for IV antibiotics. She
responded to volume resuscitation and did not require pressors.
Infectious source likely UTI based on Ucx from [**2166-3-30**] now
growing enterococcus, sensitivities pending. Plan to complete a
14-day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for urosepsis - to be
continued until [**2166-4-13**]; may be able to narrow down antibiotics
based on sensitivities. Blood cultures are also pending at time
of discharge but negative to date. Her SBPs have ranged from 85
to 105 with patient requiring and responding to occasional 500cc
LR IVF boluses; urine output maintained throughout.
.
# Urinary retention: Foley placed with urine output of 2L on
presentation. Likely related to UTI. [**Month (only) 116**] have component from MS
as well although per nursing home, had not required consistent
straight cathing. Foley in place at time of discharge. Rehab
physician [**Name (NI) 653**] to change out foley in setting of UTI. Also
recommend removing foley for voiding trial as soon as able and
routine straight cathing as indicated, especially given multiple
recent UTIs.
.
# Seizure disorder: Question of observed seizure in ED. Pt was
treated with one dose of Ativan in ED. Most likely due to
lowered seizure threshold in setting of sepsis, fevers. Possible
also that significant leukocytosis due to seizure. Pt having no
movements on arrival to floors and did not have any during ICU
course. Given phenytoin bolus and increased phenytoin regimen to
50 mg qAM, 75 mg qPM, and 100 mg qHS) with therapeutic level on
discharge. Outpatient keppra dosing maintained. She was
maintained on seizure precautions.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was tachypneic with reported
O2sat 89-91% on 2L at OSH, but question of poor pleth in setting
of peripheral vasoconstriction. She was intubated for airway
protection here. ABG not done until after intubated, which
demonstrated PaO2 290. CXR without clear pneumonia, and patient
was extubated without complication. She was maintained on 40%
face mask without any further oxygen desaturations.
.
# Acute renal failure: BUN 95 with Cr 1.6; baseline Cr appears
to be 0.7.  Most likely pre-renal. This resolved with IV fluid
resuscitation; Cr 0.5 on discharge.
.
# Metabolic acidosis: Anion Gap 13 and lactate 3, rising to 3.6
on presentation. Glucose markedly elevated but no urinary
ketones suggestive of DKA in this patient with type 2 DM. The
patient's metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis improved with
fluid resuscitation.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Pt with Type 2 DM, on Lantus 14 units qhs with
gentle ISS. Most likely elevated [**1-1**] infectious process as
above. No e/o DKA. The patient was initially started on an
insulin gtt but weaned off this as better glycemic control
attained. The patient was restarted on home lantus dose with
regular insulin sliding scale after tube feeds restarted.
.
# Hypernatremia: Na corrected for hyperglycemia is 157. Likely
secondary to dehydration from infection and osmotic diuresis in
setting hyperglycemia. Treated with combination of NS for fluid
resuscitation D5W IVF with slow correction of this over several
days. She was continued on free water flushes 200 cc q4h.
.
# MS: Lives in nursing home, and is nonverbal at baseline,
reportedly for years. Nursing home records note persistent
vegetative state. We tried to obtain medical records from [**Hospital1 2177**]
regarding prior neurologic evaluation to better ascertain her
cognition (?locked-in syndrome) but did not receive any
information prior to her discharge. Would recommend further
neurologic evaluation as outpatient if no previous work-up has
been done.
.
# Ppx: Heparin SC tid started and recommended to be continued
for DVT ppx.
.
# Access: Right IJ central venous line placed for access.
.
# Code status: Patient confirmed to be DNR but ok to intubate
and hospitalize per brother [**Name (NI) 382**] # 2). Would recommend further
discussion of goals of care as an outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
56yo M h/o MS (wheelchair bound), DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
h/o SDH who was found down at home in the bathroom on [**7-4**] and
admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**]. He was between the tub and sink
with
his head resting on the radiator and knees raised, ""unresponsive
to all stimulation"" but ""eyes open and moving"" per his ED note,
not able to verbally respond. He was being moved to a stretcher
and had ""a grand mal [**Hospital3 862**]"" and taken via EMS to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

There, he received narcan with no effect, as well as ativan and
etomidate and intubated for airway protection with concern for
status ""asthmaticus"" with all limbs ""flailing"" and
""unresponsive"". CT showed ""s/p L craniotomy w/o bleed or change
from prior scan [**2139-2-1**]"" CT C-spine showed ""cervical spondylosis
and cervical disc disease C4-C7"". CXR negative for acute
infiltrates.

He was given dilantin 1200mg x 1, 2 doses of ativan, and then
propofol, and was admitted to the ICU.

Seen by neurology, there, who had followed the patient for
""break
through [**Month/Day/Year 862**]"" and EEG had ""suggested L TLE"". Keppra was
started but discontinued due to ""cognitive SE"" and he was
maintained on ""carbitrol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]"". The consultant noted on
speaking to his RN that when propofol had been attempted to be
discontinued, he would have twitching of his ""thigh and hand
(esp
R)"" and pick at his clothes. It was unclear to the consultant
whether this represented [**Hospital1 862**] activity so the patient is
transferred here for taper off of propofol under continuous EEG
monitoring. He was given dilantin 1200mg IV on transfer.

IMPRESSION:
1. No cause for fever identified within the chest, abdomen, or
pelvis.
2. Extensive old traumatic injuries involving the ribs, pelvis
and vertebral column. Mild widening of the L3 vertebral body
anterior margin with soft tissue prominence is also likely
post-traumatic. However, an underlying destructive bone lesion
cannot be completely excluded. This is likely unrelated to the
patient's cause of fever and can be evaluated with a nonemergent
MRI.
3. Marked degenerative changes with near complete loss of joint
space involving the femoral heads bilaterally, likely related to
patient's history of avascular necrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26713**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of
long-standing MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] disorder transferred for the
question of continued [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] activity. His hosptial course by
problem is as follows:

1. NEURO: [**Last Name (Titles) **]. After admission to the ICU, he was quickly
weaned from propofol and was extubated. He had occasional
rhythmic beats of his ankle but remained alert.  On the 4th day
of admission the patient had an episode of confusion/agitation
that resulted in a code purple (psychiatric code) in the middle
of which he had a brief [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] episode characterized by head
turning to the right and right shoulder clonus.  Routine EEG
demonstrated initially demonstrated muscle artefact but a
subsequent study (on the 14th) revealed intermittent bifrontal
or generalized 4-7hz slowing. LP was performed by IR was notable
for slightly elevated protein at 52, normal glucose, no WBC, 1
RBC, negative HHV6 PCR, and negative HSV 1 and 2 PCR.  Gram
stain and culture were obtained.  CT from the OSH showed no mass
lesion or hemorrhage, which was confirmed here.  His carbatrol
was increased to 800mg q12.  He was initially started on
Dilantin, but this was stopped for fear that it was causing a
drug fever.  He was subsequently started on Keppra 1000 [**Hospital1 **].


2. ID. He had fevers as high as 102.4 over several days. He was
cultured numerous times and numerous imaging studies were
obtained including chest x-rays and a CT-torso.  No infectious
source found initially and thus the dilantin was implicated and
stopped.  Subsequently enterococcus grew from a [**7-9**] urine
culture, but was felt to be a contaminant as the UA wa negative
and the number of colonies was low (4000).  Also, his leg
wounds, likely sustained at the time of the fall were observed
to be infected.  A wound care consult was obtained and they
suggested consulting the plastics service for debridement.  They
performed some debridement and ultimately recomended against
antibiotics after suggesting them.  Again the CSF did not
demonstrate an infection.

3. RESP: Asthma. Continued on prn nebs and his steroid taper was
continued for asthma exacerbation.  The patient was also noted
to desat at night with sleep apnea.  Pulmonary was consulted and
will arrange for an outpatient sleep study.  Until that time the
patient should be maintained on nocturnal oxygen.  He shouldn't
need this during the day.

4.Psych: Confusion. On the second night of admission, he became
acutely confused, requiring restraints and seroquel to keep from
jumping out of bed. He had another episode of confusion on the
8th day of admission, threatening to through his urinal/jug at
the nursing staff.  No etiology could be identified despite the
toxic metabolic workup discussed above.  An EEG performed on
[**2140-7-15**] was likewise unrevealing regading his aberrant
behaviour.  His behavior was controlled with with PRN seroquel.


5. Cardiovascular: Patient was kept on aspirin, atenolol,
lipitor, and quinapril.  Nifedipine was restarted prior to
discharge.

6. Anemia:  This was present on admission with a HCT of 31.8,
normocytic.  Fe studies revealed iron deficiency.  He was
started on daily iron.  B12 was continued as at home.

7. Back pain:  this was controlled with baclofen, ibuprofen and
tylenol.  Oxycontin was held.

8. Endo:  Insulin sliding scale was maintained intiatlly.
Metformin and avandia restarted several days prior to dishcarge.


9. Contact was maintained with the patient's HCP [**Name (NI) **]:

Called by Emergency Department to evaluate new visual
deterioration.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23486**] is a 66-year-old woman with a nearly 20-year
history of MS who presents with decreased visual acuity in the
right eye. She was initially admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital about
a
month ago and treated for a UTI. She was discharged to home, but
she began having frequent falls. She was re-admitted to [**Location (un) **]
and began using a wheelchair. She was discharged to rehab a few
days ago. Today, however, she began complaining of an acute loss
of vision in her right eye (her left eye has minimal light
perception only due to corneal scarring). She was sent back in
to
the [**Location (un) **] ED.

At [**Hospital **] Hospital, her initial vitals included BP of 190/84;
she was afebrile. She was found on CT to have stable evidence of
demyelination and an old right cerebellar infarct. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

Here, she presented with a BP of 205/77 initially. Ophthalmology
saw her in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and found that her VA OD was 20/400,
light perception OS. Her optic nerve appeared normal on their
exam. They recommended MRI to look for enhancement of optic
nerve
and infarct of occipital lobe.

She was given 10 mg of hydralazine for her blood pressure, and
when she didn't respond she was given another 20 mg. This
resulted in a reduction of her systolic pressure into the 80s.
She was also given Phenergan for nausea. After these two events,
she became minimally responsive. An oral airway was placed, but
with rapid infusion of NS and placing her in reverse
trendelenburg, her BP improved to the 120s and she began moving
her extremities and opening eyes to command.

ROS is not possible.


Past Medical History:
1. Multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2160**], including tremors of
the
left arm and inability to write, and dragging of the left leg.
Had been independent at home with walker until a couple of weeks
ago, when had to start using a wheelchair due to frequent falls.

2. Status post corneal scar on the left, with no vision
3. s/p Tubal ligation
4. Coronary Artery Disease
5. Hyperthyroidism
6. Trigeminal neuralgia on left
7. Carotid stenosis
8. Fibromyalgia


Social History:
Denies smoking, alcohol, and illicits. Had been independent at
home, recently (last 2-3 weeks) required use of wheelchair due
to increased gait instability.

Vitals: T: 96.4 P: 60 R: 18 BP: 89/53 (from 198/66) SaO2: 99%NRB
(from 100% on RA)
General: Asleep, unresponsive to noxious.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, large corneal scar OS,
MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Eyes closed, minimally responsive to noxious
stimuli - withdraws but does not open eyes. GCS 6 (E1, V1, M4).
After receiving 2L NS and improving BP, she improved to have
spontaneous speech and followed all motor commands (GCS 15). She
remained severely dysarthric with very slow speech, however, to
the point of being unable to understand anything she said.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: Pupil on right 11 mm and fixed after pharmacologic
dilatation. VF testing not possible at this time due to minimal
responsiveness; later I believe she said she could not see a
finger in any part of her visual field, though communication was
limited by her severe dysarthria. Funduscopic exam revealed
sharp
disc margins.

Radiologic Data:
NCHCT (From [**Hospital **] Hospital - report only): Extensive
hypodensities consistent with demyelination, unchanged from
prior
study. Chronic cerebellar stroke.

NCHCT (Here): FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures,
mass effect, hydrocephalus, or acute vascular territorial
infarction.  Hypodensity of the periventricular and subcortical
white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular
infarction.
Well-defined hypodensity is noted of the right cerebellar
hemisphere consistent with remote infarction at this site.  The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  No
concerning
osseous or surrounding soft tissue abnormality is seen.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute vascular territorial
infarction.  Encephalomalacia of the right cerebellar hemisphere
and evidence of chronic microvascular infarction.

CXR:  Limited lateral view.  Otherwise no acute pulmonary
process.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-2-21**] 5:05 AM
FINDINGS: There is a regional area of abnormally restricted
diffusion in the left inferior cerebellar hemisphere, as well as
small areas of restricted diffusion in the left medulla, pons
and midbrain. Additionally, there are scattered foci of
abnormally restricted diffusion throughout the territory of the
posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally. On FLAIR images, there
is mildly increased signal in the region of the left cerebellar
hemisphere infarct, suggesting a more subacute time course. Old
right cerebellar hemispheric infarct is unchanged.

There is extensive FLAIR/T2 signal hyperintensity in the
bilateral callosal/subcallosal white matter, in a distribution
most characteristic of multiple sclerosis. There is also
periventricular and subcortical white matter FLAIR signal
hyperintensity, which may be related to multiple sclerosis, but
could also be consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic
change.

The optic nerves appear normal. There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass, or mass effect. There is no abnormal
enhancement after contrast administration.

IMPRESSION:

1. Acute/subacute infarction regionally in the left inferior
cerebellar hemisphere, in the territory of the left posterior
inferior cerebellar artery, as well as scattered foci of acute
infarction in the left medulla, midbrain, pons, and along the
territory of the bilateral posterior cerebral arteries.
Presumably, this distribution could be seen with an acute
thrombosis of the left posterior inferior cerebral artery,
followed by embolic phenomenon in the territory of the basilar
artery.

2. Extensive callosal/subcallosal white matter changes, most
consistent with history of multiple sclerosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23486**] is a 66-year-old woman with a nearly 20-year history
of MS who presents with decreased visual acuity in the right
eye. Her neuro exam is most notable for a
decreased mental status, improving from its nadir but still with
slow and limited responses; she also appears to be severely
dysarthric, which may or may not be new. These two facts make
the rest of her exam difficult to determine. However, if I
understood her correctly, she appears to have a loss of her
entire visual
field, which would imply either a a pre-chiasmatic lesion (e.g.
optic neuritis or central retinal artery occlusion, though this
latter was not seen on ophtho exam) or bilateral occipital lobe
infarct. Her mental status deterioration does raise concern for
this catastrophic latter possibility, and the exam cannot rule
out other brainstem dysfunction.

1) complete Left PICA, basilar artery infarction-
MRI notable for complete left PICA infarction with smaller
infarcts to midbrain and bilateral occipital lobes. Pt was
admitted to the neuro ICU and within the next few hours required
intubation for hypoventilation. Neurosurgical consultation was
obtained, but later declined following family discussion. The
family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and decided that given the critical
severity and location of her strokes that she would not want to
live with such severe disabilities especially in the setting of
her longstanding MS. The level of care was adjusted for comfort
measures only and the patient was extubated with morphine gtt
for comfort. The patient expired shortly thereafter. The family
declined autopsy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 38112**] is a 50-year-old
female transferred from an outside hospital for management of
a large saddle pulmonary embolus.  She had presented to an
outside hospital four to five days prior to admission with
shortness of breath, cough, and  chest pain.  She was
diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with azithromycin.

She returned on the morning of this admission with worsening
shortness of breath, left-sided chest pain, and cough; but
without hemoptysis, and also reported at that time that she
has had bilateral calf pain for two days.  She reported that
she had significant dyspnea with minimal exertion.  A CT
angiogram revealed a large saddle pulmonary embolism.  She
was hemodynamically stable and without tachycardia.  Her
oxygen saturations were 100% on nonrebreather mask.  A
cardiac echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilatation
and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular
volume and pressure overload.

She denies periods of inactivity.  She does not smoke.  She
reports no history of malignancy and has had gastrointestinal
and breast cancer screening in the past.  She reports no
bleeding or clotting disorders in her family; although, she
does report that her brother at one time (while attempting to
donate blood) was told that his blood ""had too much
clotting.""  She denies recent travel or long plane rides or
car rides.  She has been on oral contraceptive pills for
menorrhagia secondary to fibroids.  She does not have a
history of prior deep venous thromboses or pulmonary emboli.
Given the cardiac echocardiogram findings she was offered
thrombolysis.  She initially refused but then accepted this
therapy.  She denied recent surgeries, history of stroke,
active or recent bleeding, bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled
hypertension, or thrombocytopenia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2162-10-23**].
2.  Fibroids requiring oral contraceptive pills secondary to
menorrhagia.
3.  Iron deficiency anemia.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, duodenal ulcer.
5.  Mitral valve prolapse.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2162-3-23**].
7.  Gravida 2, para 2; no spontaneous abortions.
8.  Status post tubal ligation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Azithromycin (day three out of five).
2.  Advil p.o. p.r.n.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.o.d.
4.  Oral contraceptive pills; not specified.
5.  Iron supplementation.
6.  Prevacid 15 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Ditropan-XL 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  DEPAKOTE and OFLOXACIN (both causing rashes).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married with two children.  She works
as a [**Hospital6 407**] nurse.  She has a remote
smoking history; quit 10 years ago, rare alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No formerly diagnosed family history of
bleeding disorders or clotting.  The patient states that her
brother was told (at the time of blood donation) that his
blood had excess clotting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Heart rate of 104,
blood pressure of 130/70, oxygen saturation of 99% on
nonrebreather mask.  In general, in no apparent distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed pupils were
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Cardiovascular
revealed a regular rate and rhythm, slightly tachycardic.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary revealed decreased
breath sounds at the left base, otherwise clear.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  Normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically,
alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII were intact.  Strength was [**3-27**] bilaterally.  Sensation
was grossly intact.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 14.1, hematocrit of 33.7, platelets of 280.  Sodium
of 137, potassium of 4.2, bicarbonate of 22, creatinine
of 1.1.  INR of 1.1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  CT from outside hospital revealing large
saddle pulmonary embolism involving the left side and most of
the right.

Echocardiogram revealed right ventricular dilatation,
abnormal septal motion; suggestive of right ventricular
pressure and volume overload.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment revealed a 50-year-old female
with large saddle pulmonary embolus with only known risk
factor of oral contraceptive use for fibroids and
menorrhagia.  The patient has a ? family history of clotting
disorder.

1.  PULMONARY/CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient received t-PA
100 mg intravenously over two hours and then was started on a
heparin drip.  She had no complications from thrombolytic
therapy and was transferred to the floor the next day in
stable condition.

A repeat echocardiogram was obtained on hospital day three
which showed improved but residual right ventricular
dilatation and abnormal septal motion.  Coumadin was started
on the floor, and the heparin drip was continued with a
48-hour overlap with therapeutic INR.  Her oral contraceptive
pills were discontinued.  A Factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**], prothrombin gene
mutation, anticardiolipin antibody, and homocystine were sent
off for [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 38113**] workup.  Antithrombin III,
protein, culture and sensitivity will need to wait until
after her anticoagulation therapy is completed.  Most of this
workup was pending except for the homocystine level which
came back as normal.

2.  GYNECOLOGY:  The patient with a history of fibroids and
menorrhagia and had oral contraceptive pills withdrawal
bleeding while in the hospital which was not severe.  Her
hematocrit remained stable.

Gynecology was consulted regarding future management of her
menorrhagia given her anticoagulation therapy.  They
suggested using Lupron intramuscular injections; however,
given that Lupron causes a transient estrogen levels before
it suppresses estrogen, it was decided with the advice of
Hematology that Lupron not be initiated at this point;
especially since the patient was not having significant
bleeding problems at this time.  She was to follow up with
her gynecologist to monitor her menorrhagia and initiation of
Lupron may be readdressed in the future if problems should
arise.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to
home on Coumadin to follow INR levels with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 38113**] workup was pending.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  In stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Saddle pulmonary embolism.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 24791**] is a 34 y/o female previously seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the neurosurgery clinic on [**2112-7-25**] with c/o drainage from
the incision site. She was accompanied by her husband and
friend.  She was previously seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 2358**] and
treated for presumptive meningitis although there was no obvious
infection of the intrathecal baclofen pump at that time.  She
has done well since then and still looks good today, but had
some drainage yesterday apparently with some cloudy, reddish
brown material that oozed out of an opening in her back. There
was some serous fluid very lightly in and around some area where
maybe there was an opening, but could not express
anything she was afebrile.  The abdominal part of the pump looks
perfectly fine.  There is a little bit of erythema near the area
in her back possibly from pushing or pressure or placing a
dressing there.  It does not look obviously infected.  She
underwent a CT scan of the lumbar area which showed a
superficial collection, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm below the
surface of the skin and dermis layers as well as above the
fascial layer.  It is about 6 x 5 x 2-3 cm in size.  She
underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy which has been finalized as
sparse growth of methicillin resistant staph aureus. She
presents for an I & D and removal of baclofen pump hardware and
tubing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 24791**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and was taken to the OR with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. The lumbar wound was explored, washed out and hardware was
completely removed. She was taken to the ICU post operatively
for baclofen withdrawal monitoring. She was started on PO
baclofen (10mg), prednisone taper and was given ativan prn. ID
was consulted and she was started on vancomycin.
On [**7-28**] she complained of pain and spasms but was neurologically
stable. Her ativan dose was increased.
On [**7-29**] her vanco level was noted to be 9.9 so ID recommended
increasing her dose to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **].
On [**7-30**] she was again neurologically stable but complained of
spasms in her LE's. Her PO baclofen was increased to 20mg.
On [**8-1**] the patient reported improved muscle spasms. She was
requiring significantly less ativan for spasticity so she was
transferred out to the step down unit.
On [**8-2**] Baclofen dose was increased to 30mg QID.  Prednisone was
tapered to 30mg x 3 days.  She was started on Fluconazole for a
yeast infection and Nystatin for thrush.  Valium currently 15mg
PO Q4 hours prn muscle spasm.
On [**8-3**] Valium tapered to 10mg PO every four hours with Valium
5mg PO every four hours as needed for muscle spasm.  LENS
negative.
On [**8-4**] she was neurologically stable but continues with
complaints of muscle spasms.  She has been well maintained on
Valium 10mg Q4 hours with an additional 5mg as needed.  She
worked with physical therapy who determined she could be
discharged to home with PT services.
On [**8-5**] the patient agreed to discharge home.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, slurred speech and rectal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral central venous line
PICC line

History of Present Illness:
46 year old male with history of multiple sclerosis, [**First Name3 (LF) **]'s
disease, PUD s/p multiple bowel resection and partial
gastrectomy who presented from home to OSH with weakness,
slurred speech and rectal pain; he was found to be hypotensive,
hypokalemic, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
At the OSH, he complained of increased rectal pain, but could
not tell for how long. He denied previous peri-rectal abscesses.
He has not had a change in his bowel habits, with frequent
diarrhea [**1-13**] bowel resections. A CT torso was reportedly normal.
He was hypotensive and received 7 liters of NS and was started
on norepinephrine after a femoral CVL was placed. He was given
unasyn and gentamycin and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
continued management. In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, he was given vanc and
continued on norepi.
.
He was admitted to the surgical ICU given concern for a
peri-rectal abscess and sepsis as the cause of his hypotension.
He was found to have a RLE DVT, provoked from the R CVL placed
at the OSH and was started on a heparin drip. R femoral CVL was
d/c'ed and L IJ CVL was placed. He was also started empirically
on vancomycin, cipro, and metronidazole. He was transfused 2U
PRBCs for Hct 24 -> 28.
.
He was evaluated by neurology given his episode of slurred
speech. TTE with bubble study identified a PFO. MRI identified a
possible subacute stroke in the left parietal region. Given the
DVT, it was thought that this represented a paradoxical embolic
stroke (acute vs. sub acute) and recommended anticoagulation
with coumadin. Neurology also recommended outpatient follow up
for MS.
.
Norepinephrine was weaned off on [**2179-7-13**]. Vascular surgery was
consulted for consideration of IVC filter placement given need
for possible intra-operative drainage of peri-rectal abscess,
who did not feel that it was indicated. Ultimately it was
decided not to I&D the abscess. Overall, peri-rectal abscess is
3 x 1.5 cm, non-operative, likely old per attg, within rectum,
not amenable to drainage.
.
The patient was then transferred out of the ICU. He triggered
[**2179-7-17**] for SBP in the 70s. Blood and stool cultures for C. diff
were sent, and have been negative to date. He recevied 500 cc of
LR and one unit of PRBCs. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2179-7-14**],
cipro and metronidazole have been continued.
.
ROS:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Imaging:
TTE [**2179-7-13**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale is
present with right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest (using agitated saline contrast). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CT A/P: [**2179-7-11**]
1. 3.6 x 1.6 cm perirectal abscess.
2. Evidence of bowel wall thickening and mucosal enhancement at
the junction
of the small and large bowel in the right lower quadrant is
likely
representative of acute inflammation, consistent with active
[**Month/Day/Year **]'s flare.
3. Right hydrocele with no evidence of Fournier's gangrene.
.
MRI Brain [**2179-7-12**]:
1. A focal area of high signal intensity demonstrated in the
left
parietal lobe medially, suggesting subacute ischemic changes
versus
demyelination, there is no evidence of mass effect or abnormal
enhancement in the region.
.
2. Subtle areas of high signal intensity are visualized in the
subcortical white matter associated with cortical volume loss
and likely representing sequela of chronic MS changes. These
areas are involving both cerebral hemispheres, right cerebellar
hemisphere and the left medulla oblongata.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 y/o male with hx of untreated MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]'s, chronic
diarrhea, chronic perirectal abscess, and hx of GIB presented to
OSH with weakness, slurred speech, and hypotension. Found to be
severely hypokalemic, hypocalcemic, hypomagnesemic and anemic as
well, and found to have a RLE DVT. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and treatment. A right groin CVL was placed
at the OSH and this was removed and sent for culture which was
negative. He was admitted to the SICU where he was fluid
resuscitated and started on levophed for hypotension and a left
IJ CVL was placed. His electrolytes were repleted and was
transfused 2 units PRBCs for HCT of 24.2. He was started on a
Heparin drip for the DVT.
.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/SUBACUTE STROKE:
Neurology was consulted for altered mental status and a HCT was
performed showing no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect with a hypodense area noted in the left frontal lobe
likely relate to volume averaging. A follow up MRI demonstrated
a focal area of increased signal intensity in the L parietal
lobe suggesting subacute ischemic changes vs. chronic
demyelination. Also, there are subtle areas of high signal
intensity in the subcortical white matter likely representing
sequelae of chronic MS changes. Further workup for causes of
stroke included an ECHO with bubble study which revealed a PFO.
Cardiology was consulted who recommend outpatient management of
the PFO. In addition, a CTA of head/neck was without vascular
occlusion, stenosis, aneurysm formation or other vascular
abnormality. Given his DVT and PFO, this was thought that he had
paradoxical embolus resulting in subacute vs. chronic stroke and
should be anticoagulated with recommended follow up with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 24391**]e specialists as an outpatient.
.
# DVT/ANTICOAGULATION:
A heparin gtt was started for RLE DVT and initially coumadin 2mg
was given. His INR returned supratherapeutic at 4.3 and his
coumadin was held allowing him to drift downwards, likely a
result of Vit. K depletion [**1-13**] chronic diarrhea. His coumadin
was resumed, and goal INR is [**1-14**] on discharge. Would consider
extended course in setting of PFO, unless this is closed sooner.
.
# [**Month/Day (3) **]'S/CHRONIC DIARRHEA/SHORT GUT/PERI-RECTAL ABSCESS:
GI was consulted for hx of [**Month/Day (3) **]'s disease and chronic diarrhea.
The patient was followed at [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2305**] and was
receiving Remicade but has not been seen at this facility since
2/[**2174**]. C. diff Ag x3 were sent which returned as negative.
Stool cultures were sent and were all negative. Etiology for
chronic diarrhea is felt to be short gut syndrome from his
numerous prior bowel surgeries. Antibiotics were initially
started, but discontinued when no infectious source was found.
Loperamide, cholestyramine, and psyllium were initiated for
management of chronic diarrhea. TPN was initiated for management
of nutrition, as his albumin was < 1.5 on presentation. Per
surgery, patient will require improved nutrition and wound
healing prior to correction of his peri-rectal abscess. Per GI,
peri-rectal abscess would need drainage prior to initiating
effective [**Year (4 digits) **]'s therapy (budesonide vs.
prednisone vs. infliximab); however, patient is currently
reluctant for future treatments of [**Year (4 digits) **]'s.
.
# DECONDITIONING/NUTRITION
Deconditioning has been a major issue for him as well. He has
been mostly bed bound for the past year. He lives at home with
family and they report having a difficult time turning the
patient and cleaning him after his frequent stooling. PT and OT
have been working with him and they recommend rehab after
discharge. He had significant skin breakdown from incontinence
and WOCN has been involved with recommendations for skin
treatments. During family meeting, patient and family agree that
rehab for improved nutrition and wound healing are important
goals, with the ultimate goal of returning home for improved
quality of life. Wound care recommendations are noted below
separately. He was initiated on TPN via PICC line, to continue
on discharge.
.
# WOUND CARE
Recommendations:  Continue pressure relief measures per pressure
ulcer guidelines.
 Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn side to side
 Heels off bed surface at all times
 Waffle Boots to B/L LE's
.
  Moisturize B/L LE's and feet [**Hospital1 **] with Aloe Vesta Moisture
Barrier Ointment
.
 Gentle cleansing of back tissue with Foam cleanser
 Pat the tissue dry.
 Apply Aloe Vesta Moisture barrier ointment to the peri wound
tissue
 Apply Xeroform Gauze to the ulcerated sites-right trochanter,
right flank, midline
 Cover with large Sofsorb sponges
 No tape-just lay in place
 Change dressing daily and prn
.
 Apply antifungal critic Aid clear moisture barrier Ointment to
the penile shaft and scrotal tissue daily and prn or every 3rd
cleansing. Obtain securing device for indwelling Foley catheter.
.
 Apply antifungal Critic Aid Clear Moisture Barrier Ointment to
the perianal
tissue daily and prn or every 3rd cleansing to protect perianal
tissue from stool irritation. Place xeroform around the FSM at
the insertion site.
.
Nutrition has also been a major issue for him. He did pass a
bedside speech and swallow and was placed on regular diet with
Ensure supplements and protein supplements. His albumin came
back at 1.2. Nutrition was consulted to perform calorie counts
([**Date range (1) 24392**]) which are pending. If he doesn't meet needs they
recommend enteral feeds however, with multiple bowel resections
and chronic diarrhea TPN may be a better option for him. He does
have R IJ placed in the SICU since PICC can't be placed in the
setting of elevated INR. Family have been very involved and they
are currently working with the MS society about attempting to
get PCA and PT for home when the patient is discharged from
rehab.
.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital1 700**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY:
1. Chronic diarrhea from short gut syndrome
2. Untreated [**Hospital1 **]'s disease
3. Untreated multiple sclerosis
4. Chronic malnutrition
5. Chronic deconditioning
6. Peri-rectal abscess
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer
8. Deep venous thrombosis
9. Subacute stroke from patent foramen ovale

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Bedbound.


Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for management of your
chronic diarrhea, low blood pressure, peri-rectal abscess,
change in speech, and blood clot. Your electrolytes were
corrected and you were treated aggressively for shock with
fluids and antibiotics. You met with the neurology team, who
felt that you suffered from a subacute stroke. You were found to
have a patent foramen ovale, which may be the cause for your
stroke. Cardiology felt that this can be managed with surgery in
the future, if you would like. Fortunately, your speech
continued to improve. You will need to stay on coumadin for the
blood clot and the stroke.
.
With regard to your chronic diarrhea, a thorough infectious
work-up did not reveal an infectious cause. The GI doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**]
that the cause may be related to short gut syndrome from your
numerous prior bowel surgeries. It was noted that you have not
had treatment for your MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]'s since [**2174**], and it will be
important to re-establish care with your previous doctors after [**Name5 (PTitle) 17773**] are discharged from rehab.
.
With regard to your peri-rectal abscess, the surgery team felt
that this was not amenable to drainage or correction right now,
but that in the future, with improved nutrition, you may be able
to undergo correction of this. For nutrition, you were started
on TPN. For wound healing in the rectal area and management of
the chronic diarrhea, you are continuing with the rectal tube,
which was placed by surgery.
.
Prior to your discharge, a family meeting occurred and you
agreed that going to rehab to become stronger was a good option,
with the ultimate goal of going home. For any questions in the
future, please feel free to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (surgery) or
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] (GI).

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2405**] (PCP), Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **]
(surgery), and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] (GI) after being discharged from
acute care rehab. Please have your primary care doctor establish
care with a neurologist and cardiologist for your stroke and
patent foramen ovale.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Nasogastric tube
2. PICC line

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year-old female who is a pathologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] with a
history of worsening MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presents to the ED
with Baclofen overdose. The history was obtained from the
patient's husband. The patient has relapsing progressive
multiple sclerosis that has been worsening over the last two
years and has been wheelchair bound. The husband states that she
has had [**Last Name (Titles) **] for years, but seemed more depressed over the
last week. He could not identify a particular trigger, but
thought that the holidays had made things worse. The patient was
at home alone when the husband got a call from his wife who was
tearful and said she had taken ""20 tabs"" of baclofen, but the
husband thought she had taken more. Per ED they had estimated
~80-170 pills equaling 3400mg) He called EMS and on arrival they
cound her ""sleepy"" and tachycardic to the 120-140's.
.
In the ED she was 97.6 98 158/78 14 100% RA. She became more
somnolent then unresponsive and was intubated for airway
protection. She was started on a propofol gtt in the ED. Initial
vent settings were Tv: 500, PEEP: 5, RR: 12 and FiO2: 50%. CXR
showed right main-stem intubation and tube was withdrawn 3 cm.
Her ABG was 7.32/45/132/24. She was given 25g of charcoal. Her
labs were significant for a tox screen positive for opiates and
amphetamines. She had a mildly positve UA and was give cipro.
She was seen by Tox in the ED who recommended supportive care,
tachyarrhythmias per ACLS and bradydysrhythmias with atropine.
.
On arrive to the ICU the patient was intubated and sedated.

Imaging:
[**2160-1-11**] CXR: OGT in stomach. RUE PICC stable. Lungs remain clear
without effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2160-1-8**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This tracing gives evidence for a severe
diffuse
encephalopathy with periods of runs of what looks like
relatively
sustained epileptiform activity over both central regions and
also
occasional multifocal independent interictal epileptiform spike
wave
discharges seen on the spike detection algorithm only. It is
also noted
that the frequency of the sustained epileptiform activity seemed
to
decrease during the course of the study.
[**2160-1-7**] CXR: The ET tube tip continues to be relatively low, 2 cm
above the carina. There is progression of the left lower lobe
opacities, still most likely represent atelectasis, but should
be further followed to exclude the possibility of developing
infection. Otherwise, no significant change has been
demonstrated.
[**2160-1-6**] CXR: The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube
in the
proximal aspect of the right main stem bronchus. If the tube is
withdrawn
approximately 3 cm, it would be appropriately positioned. There
is left
retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
present.
There is an OG tube within the stomach. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  IMPRESSION: Right
mainstem bronchial intubation. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year-old female pathologist with history of worsening MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34499**] admitted with Baclofen overdose.  Hospital course
complicated by seizures and delirium.
.
#Baclofen overdose: Husband reports that she took 70 Baclofen
pills. Tox screen was negative for coexisting substances.  She
was intubated for airway protection given sedation in the ED.
She was seen by toxicology in the ED who recommended supportive
care.  On the first hospital day, she had brady and
tachyarrhythmias.  In addition, she had two seizures that day-
the first of which was self limited and the second which did not
respond to IV Ativan.  She was started on a midazolam drip for
seizure prevention.  She was subsequently loaded with Dilantin
and then midazolam was weaned once Dilantin was therapeutic.
She was also hooked up to cEEG. The seizures were beleived to be
due to Baclofen withdrawal. Her Baclofen was restarted at half
dose 36 hours after intoxication taking the half life of
Baclofen into consideration.  It was subsequently increased to
home dose. Her EEG improved after she was restarted on her home
dose of Baclofen. Her Dilantin was then stopped as she does not
have an underlying seizure disorder but rather had seizures as
she was withdrawing from thr Baclofen.
.
#Respiratory Distress: She was intubated for airway protection
in the setting of sedating overdose with Baclofen.  Initial CXR
showed right main stem intubation with subsequent LLL
atelectasis.  The ETT was pulled back and confirmed with CXR.
On the third day of hospitalization ([**1-8**]), she had a new
leukocytosis, a fever to 100.7, and thick secretions with some
concern for a RLL infiltrate.  Vancomycin and Cefepime were
started for HCAP treatment for a planned 8 day course.  A PICC
line was placed for these antibiotics. She was extubated without
issue after 5 days of invasive ventilation.  After transfer to
the Neurology service from the ICU, she had no evidence of any
infection and her CXR was clear, so it was decided that her
antibiotics would be stopped (on [**1-13**]). During her stay on the
floor, she has had no respiratory issues.
.
#Psych: Given her impulsive suicide attempt, she was followed by
the psych department while she was an inpatient. They determined
that discharge to [**Hospital1 **] reheab, where she would be followed
by the psych department there, would be a safe discharge for
her. Her Effexor ER was initially held, but was subsequently
restaretd at a dose of 37.5 mg as per psych. Can Consider adding
Adderall when at rehab as per psych.
.
#UTI: She had a mildly positive urinalysis and a urine culture
revealing pansensitive E.coli.  She was initially treated with
ciprofloxacin on [**1-7**].  However, this was discontinued once
Vancomycin/Cefepime was started on [**1-8**].
.
#MS: She has secondary progressive MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] her outpatient
psychiatrist and neurologist, venlafaxine and mycophenalate were
held during her acute illness.  Mycophenalate was restarted on
[**1-12**].  Venlafaxine was also subsequently restarted at a dose of
37.5 mg daily as per psych.
.
#FEN: She was fed with TPN during her intubation.  She failed
speech and swallow on the day of extubation.  A nasogastric tube
was placed for both tube feeds and medication administration.  A
repeat speech and swallow evaluation showed that she had no
difficulty with swallowing and she was started on a regular
diet.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a Baclofen overdose,
which you say was an impulsive and not a planned act. Upon
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, you were intubated for airway
protection. You were seen by toxicology, who reccommended
supportive care. During your first day in the hospital, you had
2 seizures for which you were started on Dilantin and placed on
cEEG. The seizures and the subsequent delusions you experienced
were likely due to withdrawal from Baclofen. You have since been
restarted on your home dose Baclofen. The Dilantin has also been
stopped as you do not have an underlying seizure disorder. After
you were extubated, you were transferred to the Neurology
service. While on the neurology service, you passed a speech and
swallow eval and was started on a regular diet. You were also
seen by PT, who reccomended that you would benefit from rehab
given that you were bedbound for 1 week. You were seen by
psychiatry, who restarted you on your home Effexor and also
helped formualte the plan for a safe discharge to [**Hospital1 **], where you will be followed by the psychiatry service
there. With regards to your MS, you were continued on your home
dose of Cellcept.

MEDICATIONS:   Neurontin 300 mg three times a day,
amitriptyline 75 mg daily at bedtime, primidone one-half
tablet twice a day, and Baclofen 10 mg three times a day.

ALLERGIES:   She has an allergy to penicillin, which causes
hives, and an allergy to bee stings.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 154/67 taken on the
right, pulse 100.  General:  Well-appearing, appears her
stated age, walks with a cane, uses wheelchair for long
distances.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No
lymphadenopathy.  Tympanic membranes clear.  Chest and lungs
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdominal examination:  Soft,
nontender, slightly distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly and
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Motor strength 5/5
bilaterally in the lower extremities.  Reflexes are 3+
patellar bilaterally, and 2+ Achilles tendon bilaterally.

PLAN:   Schedule for nucleus caudalis Drez procedure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2173-2-3**], and she was taken to the operating room, where she
underwent a suboccipital craniectomy and a C1-C2 laminectomy
with a radio frequency Drez lesion in the trigeminal nucleus
caudalis (C2 to Obex) on the left side.  Findings included
possible mild atrophy of the caudal medulla with left-sided
PICA adherent to an grooving the surface directly over the
nucleus caudalis.  This was separated and held apart with
shredded Teflon.  The patient tolerated the procedure well,
and was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.  Her left-sided facial pain had been
resolved.  Her trigeminal sensation appeared symmetric at
branches V1 and V3.  Grip was good bilaterally.  Her
iliopsoas motor strength was symmetric, though examination
was somewhat limited secondary to her pronounced nausea.

Over the next several days, her postoperative nausea improved
substantially.  She was transferred up to the Neurosurgical
floor, and continued to do well.  She was seen
postoperatively on [**2173-2-4**], by the Cardiology service,
following up her preoperative evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in
which she seemed to have an abnormal preoperative
electrocardiogram.  Cardiac enzymes were sent, and her CK/MB
came back at 15, slightly elevated, however, her MB index was
2%, and her troponin was 0.4.  Her CK was substantially
elevated at 872.  Cardiology recommended increasing her
Lopressor to 50 mg twice a day and start aspirin as soon as
safe postoperatively.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, diarrhea, and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old woman with
progressive multiple sclerosis diagnosed approximately 11
diarrhea.  At her baseline she can only speak a couple of
words and responds to questions with hand squeezing.

Approximately two month prior to admission she developed
diarrhea with intermittent fevers.  She was taken to [**Hospital6 3622**] and diagnosed with a urinary tract infection
and treated with a course of levofloxacin.  On [**12-4**],
Hospital where she developed a pneumothorax after central
line placement.  A colonoscopy on [**2189-12-8**]
reportedly showed ischemic colitis, and she was discharged.
On [**2189-12-10**], she again developed fever to 103, now
with shortness of breath and congestion.  No cough, but she
normally cannot cough.  Her diarrhea is typically five to six
large volume stools with mucous, without any [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] day.

Upon presentation to the Emergency Department she was
lethargic with temperature equal to 101.4 rectally,
pulse 120, [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure 96/50, with a saturation of 94% on
2 liters.  She responded well to hydration and became much
more alert.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed approximately 11 years ago;
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25427**].  It has been recently rapidly
progressive.
2.  Suprapubic catheter placed about two years ago and
recurrent urinary tract infections.
3.  History of bladder stones.
4.  History of renal stones, status post lithotripsy and
surgical interventions.
5.  Aspiration pneumonia approximately three years ago in the
setting of hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Baclofen 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 600 mg p.o. q.p.m.
3.  Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Atropine for her diarrhea which was prescribed on
[**2189-12-8**], after the colonoscopy at [**Hospital6 3426**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN gives a rash.  VANCOMYCIN gives a
rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] elderly
facility.  No tobacco.  No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination
temperature was 101.4, pulse 110, [**Hospital3 **] pressure 120/64,
respiratory rate 25, saturation 97% on 2 liters.  In general,
she was in no acute distress, able to answer questions by
squeezing hands.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed mucous membranes were moist.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Her neck was stiff, which is baseline.  It was
difficult to assess jugular venous distention from her
posture.  Respiratory revealed coarse breath sounds
anteriorly.  Rhonchi at bases, left greater than right.
Cardiovascular was tachycardic.  A 3/6 systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border which is known.  Abdominal was
soft, left upper quadrant tenderness.  No peritoneal signs.
Suprapubic tube indwelling without erythema.  Extremities
revealed dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Feet were
contracted.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White [**Hospital3 **] cell count 18;
90 neutrophils, 5.4 lymphocytes, 4.2 monocytes.
Hematocrit 37.1, platelets 425.  SMA-7 revealed sodium
of 135, potassium 3.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 21, [**Hospital3 **]
urea nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose of 139.  Liver
function tests were pending.  Amylase and lipase were
pending.  When seen in the Emergency Room urinalysis
remarkable for moderate [**Hospital3 **], specific gravity of 1.015,
pH 5, nitrite negative, 2 red [**Hospital3 **] cells, 11 to 20 white
[**Hospital3 **] cells, many bacteria, 3 to 5 epithelial cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray revealed kyphotic woman with
a left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate
of 102, axis approximately zero, intervals 142/80/340.  A
T wave inversion in III.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of
multiple sclerosis evaluated by Neurology in the Emergency
Department who presents with a fever, pneumonia by chest
x-ray, and left upper quadrant tenderness.  The patient will
be started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for the possibility of
an aspiration pneumonia.  As per the Neurology evaluation in
the Emergency Room, there did not seem to be any appreciable
neurologic change from baseline.  Gastrointestinal workup
with stool for C. difficile times three will be sent given
history of recent antibiotic use.  A Gastrointestinal
consultation will be obtained to evaluate this ongoing
chronic diarrhea.  The patient will be given fluids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**12-12**] an abdominal CT was
obtained that showed bibasilar consolidation, left greater
than right, and bilateral pleural effusions.  The urine
culture sent from the Emergency Department grew out
enterococcus, and she was started on vancomycin.  She has a
prior history of a rash to vancomycin, so the patient was
premedicated with Benadryl, and the vancomycin was run over
six hours.  She tolerated this without complications.

The abdominal CT showed no evidence of ischemic colitis.  On
[**12-13**] a rash was noted, and her antibiotics were
changed to ceftriaxone and clindamycin, and then to
clindamycin and vancomycin.  Her oxygen saturations continued
to be in the high 90s on 4 liters demonstrating her
significant oxygen requirement.

On [**12-14**], she developed a increased oxygen requirement,
and on chest x-ray was noted to have left lower lobe
collapse.  An arterial [**Month (only) **] gas at that time was 7.44/34/99.
Clindamycin was discontinued at that time and Flagyl was
started.  A bronchoscopy was performed that revealed thick
secretions which were suctioned and demonstrated no mucous
plus or endobronchial lesions.  For the gastrointestinal
workup, Clostridium difficile times three was negative.

On [**12-14**], an Infectious Disease consultation was
obtained and thought the rash was secondary to ceftriaxone.
For the pneumonia she was restarted on Levaquin and Flagyl,
and vancomycin was continued for the enterococcus urinary
tract infection.

On [**12-15**], the colonoscopic biopsy at [**Hospital6 3426**] were reviewed here at this hospital which showed
right colon with nonspecific inflammation of the lamina
propria without active colitis, and in the left colon
melanosis coli.  These findings were possibly consistent with
laxative use.

The patient also had a few episodes of mucous plugging which were
cleared with deep suctioning which also triggered
a cough.  A chest x-ray demonstrated persistent collapse of
the left lower lobe.  A thoracentesis was done to evaluate
the pleural effusion on the left side; 600 cc of bloody fluid
was drained with a hematocrit of 5%.  Studies revealed an
exudative process with a pH of 7.37.  A chest x-ray after the
thoracentesis demonstrated improved aeration.

On [**12-15**], lower extremity Doppler was performed that
were negative for deep venous thrombosis.

On [**12-16**], the patient's elevated INR was reversed with
vitamin K.  The elevated INR was thought secondary to
nutritional deficiency and antibiotic use.  Her tube feeds
were restarted, and her diarrhea was resolving.  After the
tube feeds were started the patient had another episode of
respiratory distress thought secondary to aspiration.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with diffuse
inferior T wave inversions.  At that time, a CT angiogram was
also done that revealed partially occlusive pulmonary emboli
in the left upper lobe lingula and proximal segment of left
lower lobe with some interval decrease in the pleural
effusions.  With these findings, the patient was started on
heparin.

On [**12-17**], the patient had another episode of
respiratory distress.  An arterial [**Month (only) **] gas done at that
time was 7.44/33/72.  This resolved with deep suctioning and
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  Her tube feeds continued to be
held secondary to high residuals and concerns for aspiration.

On [**12-18**], the patient again developed respiratory
distress.  An arterial [**Month (only) **] gas done at that time was
7.19/70/45.  Otherwise, the patient was hemodynamically
stable.  A STAT chest x-ray at that time showed no evidence
of left lower lobe collapse.  She was intubated and transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.

On [**12-18**], in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the
patient underwent another bronchoscopy that showed thick
secretions in her upper airway which were suctioned.  The
patient was weaned from the vent, and her tube feeds were
held in anticipation of an extubation.

On [**12-19**], the patient was extubated.  On [**12-20**],
the patient remained stable after extubation and was called
out to the medicine floor team.  Active issues at this time
included (1)  Pulmonary emboli with no evidence of deep
venous thrombosis.  The possibility of in situ thrombosis has
been raised.  Either way, the patient was on heparin and will
be placed on Coumadin for six months once the patient is more
stable.  (2)  Aspiration:  The patient is on levofloxacin,
clindamycin, and Flagyl; at this point day 9 of 14.  The
patient was still requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet, and
deep suctioning, and cough stimulation.  The patient has not
had a formal swallowing evaluation; however, the patient
coughs when given sips of fluids.  The patient will be
formally evaluated by the Swallow Team during this admission.
(3)  The diarrhea is still present, although slightly
decreased.  Multiple causes exist including liquid diet with
tube feeds only and heavy antibiotics.  (4)  Infectious
Disease:  Antibiotics per Pulmonary for the pneumonia.  The
patient was on day eight of an unclear course of vancomycin
for her urinary tract infection.

On [**12-21**], the patient had a formal swallowing
evaluation which she failed.  Vancomycin was discontinued as
well.  Overnight from [**12-21**] to [**12-22**], the patient
became short of breath and tachypneic.  A workup at that time
including an electrocardiogram, and arterial [**Month (only) **] gas, and a
chest x-ray with the conclusion was most likely the patient
experienced a mucous plugging event which resolved.  At that
time the patient was also bolused 500 cc of normal saline.
Stool studies on [**12-22**] returned as rare fecal fat;
therefore, the likelihood of malabsorption was thought to be
very low, and her diarrhea was thought secondary to
originally laxatives and now antibiotics and a liquid diet
only.  Progressive pulmonary toilet was performed.

On [**12-23**], the patient remained stable without any acute
events.  The patient again had a swallowing evaluation and
failed this evaluation.  The possibilities for why the
patient could not swallow were (1) deconditioning after 10
days in the hospital including an intubation; or,
(2) progression of her multiple sclerosis.  Either way, the
patient is an aspiration risk now, and to maintain her
nutritional status and recover her strength needed a feeding
tube placed.  The family was presented with these choices by
the attending and will talk amongst themselves and decide
overnight and will tell us on [**12-24**] whether they would
like a feeding tube for the patient.

On [**12-24**], the family decided against the feeding tube
and wanted the nasogastric tube taken out, and they would
cautiously feed the patient understanding that she is an
aspiration risk, but stating that this is not entirely
different from her baseline, and that if one is careful and
spends much time with her as the family does at home that the
patient will not aspirate.  After a long discussion, the team
agreed to follow the patient's family wishes, and the nasogastric
tube was discontinued, and there were no plans to place a feeding
at this time.  Thus, the patient was started on Coumadin.  Her
vancomycin had been stopped two days prior.  The patient had
one day remaining on her Levaquin and Flagyl.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  On [**12-25**], her Levaquin and
Flagyl for the aspiration pneumonia were discontinued.  The
patient was given Lovenox and Coumadin.  Arrangements were
made for follow up, and the patient was discharged close to
baseline, in sick but stable condition on [**2189-12-25**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow-up arrangements were made
with a new primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1446**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]
with Pulmonary; an appointment was made for [**Last Name (LF) 2974**],
[**1-1**].  Follow up with Gastrointestinal, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
was made as well for [**1-19**].  These appointments were
provided to the patient's family, and arrangements were made
with the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at [**Hospital6 733**] and [**Location (un) 86**]
[**Hospital6 407**] for INR checks on Monday, and
discontinuation of the Lovenox and further management of the
Coumadin.  The patient's family was provided with all of
these arrangements.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 600 mg p.o. q.p.m.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Baclofen 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Imodium 4 mg p.o. first bowel movement; 2 mg each loose
stool after, at first loose stool, maximum 24 mg per day.
6.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. until INR is
therapeutic, per the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic at [**Hospital6 2399**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diarrhea secondary to melanosis coli.
2.  Pneumonia, thought aspiration.
3.  Multiple sclerosis.
4.  Suprapubic tube.
5.  History of bladder and renal stones.
6.  History of aspiration and current aspiration risk.

The family acknowledged understanding the risks of taking the
patient home and feeding her, but wanted to pursue this
option for the patient's quality of life.  The team thought
this was a reasonable choice and communicated these plans to
the primary doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1446**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow-up appointments were made as
previously dictated, and the patient will follow up as
specified.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hemoptysis and altered mental status and
hypoxemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 67-year-old
female with end stage multiple sclerosis at [**Known lastname 5348**] who is
aphasic and minimally interactive.  She was brought to the
Emergency Room by her daughter for an episode of hemoptysis
this afternoon associated with three weeks of increasing
lethargy and a cough productive of yellowish-clear sputum.
The day of admission, the patient developed a worsening cough
productive of dark sputum.  Of note, the patient has a
decreased intake through her G-tube over the past three days
secondary to coughing and for fear of aspiration.  The
daughter denies any fevers, chills, diarrhea.  No abdominal
pain.  In the field, the patient was apparently found to have
oxygen saturation in the 80's on room air, otherwise, her
vital signs were stable.  In the Emergency Room, the patient
was placed on a non-rebreather mask and her oxygen
saturations came up to the mid 90's.  She intermittently had
cough productive of dark brown and greenish sputum and when
she had difficulty clearing the secretions and, with the
secretions, her oxygen saturation would drop temporarily
until she was able to be suctioned.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further treatment and monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis.  This is a chronic progressive form
    of the disease and was diagnosed 14 years ago.
2.  Seizure disorder first diagnosed a year ago, on Dilantin.
3.  Frequent UTI's with MRSA and VRE in the past.  The
    patient has a suprapubic catheter that is indwelling.
4.  Nephrolithiasis.
5.  History of multiple aspiration pneumonias.
6.  History of PE.
7.  History of GI bleed, ill defined.  The patient had a
fairly normal EGD and colonoscopy in [**2189**].

MEDICATIONS:  At home, the patient is taking the following
medications:
1.  Neurontin, 300 mg per her G-tube in the morning, 600 mg
per G-tube in the evening.
2.  Dilantin, 125 mg G-tube b.i.d..
3.  Protonix, 40 mg G-tube q d.
4.  Diazepam, 2 mg PO t.i.d..
5.  Prozac, 10 mg PO q d.
6.  Thiamine, 100 mg PO q d.
7.  [**Doctor Last Name **] Cream to the face.

ALLERGIES:  Patient has known allergy to penicillin and
vancomycin.  She has apparent Redman syndrome, although the
patient has tolerated vancomycin in the past with slow
infusion and premedication with Tylenol and Benadryl.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a niece with multiple
sclerosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, but has 24 hour
care between visiting nurses and her four daughters.
Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] is the health care proxy.

LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  The patient laboratory data on
admission was as follows:  White count of 10.4, hematocrit
39.4, platelets 390.  Chemistry-7 was 129, 4.8, 92, 25, 19,
0.4, and 68.  Her venous [**Name2 (NI) **] gas was 7.28, 64, and 52 on a
non-rebreather.

Her chest x-ray showed no acute CHF or infiltrates.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 80 with no acute ischemic
changes.

Her UA had moderate leukocyte esterase, [**Name2 (NI) **], and 20 white
[**Name2 (NI) **] cells.  She had cultures of the [**Name2 (NI) **], urine, and
sputum which were pending on [**6-15**].  By [**6-15**], the patient's
white count was 7.5, hematocrit 37.2, platelets 320.  Her
Chemistry-7 was 135, 4.3, 100, 24, 14, 0.4, and 70.  Of note,
her Dilantin level on admission was 35 and on [**6-15**] it was
29.8.

CTA to rule out PE was considered, but the patient was
considered too unstable in the Emergency Room to have this
done and the patient's daughter, the health care proxy, was
reluctant to have exams and insisted they be done only if
absolutely necessary.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure
was deemed likely due to either a bronchitis with mucous
secretions or an aspiration pneumonia superimposed on her
neuromuscular dysfunction from her multiple sclerosis with
poor pulmonary reserve.  The patient was treated empirically
with levofloxacin for pneumonia, despite the clear chest
x-ray, due to the heavy and copious secretions.  Over the 48
hours after admission in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's respiratory status stabilized.  She was saturating
95-100% on five liters nasal cannula, although she continued
to have the secretions.  She was treated with albuterol and
Atrovent nebulized p.r.n..  To allow her to minimize
secretions and to clear those secretions, she was treated
with a scopolamine patch and with chest physical therapy.

2.  Neurologic:  The patient's mental status improved little
over her hospitalization.  On [**6-15**], she opened her eyes to
name, but that was it.  Her mental status was due, likely, to
a combination of her acute illness and the underlying
multiple sclerosis, and it was deemed that her mental status
was not far from [**Month/Year (2) 5348**].  The patient's Dilantin was held
for a super therapeutic level and should be restarted when
she has a level less than 20.  A free Dilantin level is
pending at the time of discharge from the Intensive Care
Unit.  The patient was continued on her diazepam for spasm,
and Prozac and Neurontin at their outpatient doses.  The
patient's regular neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25427**] and he was
notified that the patient was in house and he said that he
would try to come and see the patient, although he had not
done so by [**6-15**] in the morning.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient had low grade fevers,
along with the white cells in the urine.  The patient has
recurrent UTI's.  She was treated with levofloxacin
empirically, and all the sputum, [**Month/Year (2) **], and urine cultures
were still pending on [**6-15**], and the source of her low grade
fevers and white cells in the urine was uncertain.  The
antibiotics will need to be adjusted for the culture data,
given the patient's history of MRSA and VRE in the urine.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  On arrival to the Intensive Care Unit,
the patient had one episode of coffee ground aspirate from
her G-tube.  The patient had a normal EGD and colonoscopy,
with the exception of some erythema in the gastric mucosa and
some diverticula, roughly one year prior to presentation.
The etiology of the upper GI bleed.  It was likely gastritis
versus [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear from coughing or retching.  The
patient was treated with b.i.d. PPI.  She had two large bore
peripheral ID's placed.  Her coagulation studies were normal
and her hematocrit stabilized roughly 1 to 2 points below her
admission hematocrit.  If the patient was treated
conservatively for this GI bleed, she had no recurrence of
the GI bleed nor aspirate of heme positive contact.  She was
actually guaiac from below in the Emergency Department.  In
order to undergo EGD, the patient would have to be intubated,
which the family is not eager to do at this point.  Should
the patient ever have a brisk bright red [**Doctor Last Name **] GI bleed, the
family would have to be notified as the patient would be
extremely difficult to intubate and would need fiberoptic
endotracheal tube placement for the EGD.

5.  Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition:  The patient was
continued on maintenance IV fluids through her hospital stay,
and her tube feeds were restarted on [**6-15**].
6.  Code status:  Patient is Do Not Resuscitate, however, the
patient should be intubated temporarily for acute respiratory
compromise with the understanding that this would likely be
just for the family to arrive to the hospital and see the
patient and then make their final decision to withdraw care.

 s/p left hip fxr repair with failure to extubate.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
81-year-old female, with a history of COPD on home O2, severe
MS, PAF, PVD, who sent to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) 620**] on [**7-27**]. She
initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] [**2129-7-22**] with cough. She was
admitted and treated for a COPD exacerbation with a steroid
taper and ceftriaxone and Z-Pak for empiric coverage of acute
bronchitis. She was also noted to have renal failure thought
secondary to dehydration. From the DC summ, she was also felt to
be volume overloaded later in the stay. She was evaluated with
an echo which showed high filling pressures, mild MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of
50%. Cardiology recommend restarting her Lasix on [**7-26**] at
20mg/day (had been on 120) and her Cr decreased with this. Plan
was to titrate up her Lasix dose as her Cr would tolerate. Her
HCTZ was restarted on [**7-26**] as well.
.
On [**7-27**], she was scheduled to be transfered to rehab and had a
mechanical fall at [**Location (un) 620**]. Xrays showed left complex acetabular
fracture. Decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for a surgical
repair. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2637**] accepted the patient, however upon arrival
to the floor, it was felt that the complexity of the patient
necisitated a transfer to the medicine team.
.
Treated on medicine until [**7-29**] when taken to OR. Post-op, unable
to extubate patient secondary to respiratory distress so sent to
MICU for furhter care.

terminating in the SVC. The catheter is ready for use.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yof with MMP s/p hip fracture repair, failed exutbation
in PACU.
.
1. Respiratory failure: Pulling TV of 1000+ on [**6-18**]. RSBI 25. ABG
7.33/40/140. Suspect failure to extuabte post-op was anesthesia
related. She does not appear fluid overloaded on exam. Nothing
concerning for PNA. Was extubated successfully the night of
[**7-29**].  Her COPD exacerbation was successfully treated with
steroids, nebulizer treatments, and 1 week of CTX.  Her wheezing
greatly improved and she was transitioned to prednisone 20mg
daily at time of discharge.  She should continue this for 2 more
days, then decrease to prednisone 10mg daily for three days.
Her Advair, Spiriva and nebs should be continued.
.
2. Hip fracture: s/p acetabular fracture repaire through groin.
Ortho took her to the OR on [**7-29**] and performed a left acetabular
ORIF.  She was given 1 week of post-op antibiotics empirically.
She was initially on Lovenox once daily for DVT ppx given her
hip fx, but this was converted to fondaparinux 2.5mg SC qD given
concern for HIT (see below).  This should be continued until her
HIT Ab returns negative, and then may be transitioned back to
Hep SC tid.  She is to f/u with orthopedics in 2 weeks after
discharge.  Her dressings are to be changed as needed as these
have been draining serous discharge from her wound.  On day of
discharge, orthopedics evaluated the would who felt there was no
infxn present.  She is to be touch-down weight baring on her
Left leg until cleared by orthopedics to advance.
.
3. Decreasing Plts
There was a concern for HIT given drop in plts >50% in 4 days
from 360->140.  Her Lovenox SC qD was switched to Fondaparinux
2.5mg SC qD and a HIT Antibody was sent out.  This was pending
at day of discharge and should be followed up.  If this returns
negative, she may be re-challenged with Hep SC tid and her
platelets should be closely monitored.
.
4. DM:
She was on an aggressive Insulin sliding scale given FS in teh
300s while on the steroids for her COPD exacerbation.  Given her
elevated BS, she was started on NPH 7 units qAM and 4 units qhs
along with her Humalog SS tid with meals.  Please follow up on
her BS and adjust her scale accordingly as she is tapering off
of the steroids over the next week.
.
4. ARF:
Developed anuria in the first 24 hours post-op.  Likely ATN
given extensive intra-op blood loss of 2L.  Cr peaked at 3.3 on
[**7-31**] and slowly trended back down to 1.6 on day of discharge.
Her nephrotoxic meds were held and all other meds were renally
dosed.  Please continue to monitor her Creatinine daily or every
other day until her creatinine returns to baseline (1.1-1.2).
.
5. CHF: Currently appears euvolemic. Will hold her Lasix for now
until ARF resolves.  Please restart Lasix 40mg once daily once
her creatinine returns to normal.
.
6. Rhythm: History of afib; currently vpaced. Off coumadin prior
to admission. No plans to restart now given fall risk and
dementia.
.
7. COPD flare:
Initially diagnosed with COPD flare at [**Hospital1 **]; started on
ABx, steroids.  No evidence of bacterial PNA.  Continue Abx x1
week. On Prednisone 20mg daily x2 more days, then 10mg daily x3
days.  Cont spiriva, advair, nebs.
.
8. HTN:
Initially held BP meds given ARF, post-op blood loss.  Now
hypertensives to 200s and
restarted home dose of lopressor 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem 360 qD.
Her HCTZ 25mg daily was held and should be restarted once her
creatinine returns to normal.
.
9. Gout: Cont renally dosed allopurinol of 100mg every other
day.
.
10. Nutrition: Renal, cardiac, diabeteic diet.  Passed a formal
speech and swallow eval that did not show evidence of
aspiration.
.
DISPO - Pt was discharged to rehab with ortho f/u in 2 weeks.
Pls f/u on HIT Ab; no heparin products are to be given until
that is found to be negative.  Pls f/u on her creatinine daily
until it returns to baseline.  PICC may be removed once blood
draws are no longer required.

Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-12-30**] - CABGx4 (Left internal mammary->left anterior
descending artery, vein->ramus, Vein->first obtuse marginal
artery, vein->second obtuse marginal artery).
[**2127-12-26**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 42 year old male with a history of
hyperlipidemia and a family history of early CAD who presents
from an outside hospital with a history of SSCP and ETT showing
an anteroapical and inferior-lateral wall deficits.  He reports
that on [**12-10**] he was walking to the corner of his street (about
3 blocks) when he felt like ""someone hit my chest with a sledge
hammer.""  He felt [**8-25**] burning/pulling SSCP that radiated down
his left arm and up his neck causing his neck to feel ""on fire.""
 His left arm also felt numb.  He reports feeling SOB, dizzy,
lightheaded, and diaphoretic.  He denies nausea/vomiting.
Because of these symptoms, the patient returned home and rested,
and his chest pain lasted for several hours and then decreased
to 0/10.  The patient reports that since the summer he has had
decreased exercise tolerance and increased fatigue with
exertion.  He can normally walk 15-20 miles each day.  He says
that all his life he has had angina which he describes as both a
burning sensation and tightness in his chest that usually
ressolves with palpation.  His most recent angina was 4 weeks
prior to this episode, and he usually has this once every 2
months.  He reports he has this once every 2 months.  He reports
eating a poor diet with many fried foods.  He did not take an
ASA for the 7 days PTA.
.
On [**12-15**], the patient presented to his PCP with complaints of
nasal congestion and subjective fever, and he also mentioned
this episode of chest pain.  He was prescribed a Z-pack for
sinusitis.  An EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V6.  Since this
was a change from his previous EKGs, he was referred for a
thallium stress test.  The stress test was done on [**12-24**], which
showed a fixed anterior apical wall infarct, a reversible
inferior lateral wall defect, akinesis of the apex, and EF of
30%.  He was notified of these results, seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-25**],
and referred to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital.
.
He was admitted on [**12-25**] to [**Hospital3 1443**]. CEs: Trop T 0.09
-> 0.10 -> 0.08, CK 77 -> 75 -> 73, CKMB 3 -> 2. proBNP 1585.
Chol 282, TG 191, HDL 29, LDL 215.  TTE showed EF 30%. He was
started on ASA 325 daily, Plavix 600 mg PO x1, Plavix 75 PO
daily, Lopressor 25 mg PO bid, and Zocor 80 mg PO daily.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was given Plavix 600 mg x1, ASA 325 mg x1,
Lopressor 25 mg x1, Zocor 80 mg x1. Cardiac catheterization
showed
.
He reports his last chest pain was on [**12-10**].
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.  He does
report recent fever in relation to his URI.  He reports that he
gets the taste of iron in his mouth on occasion.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain and orthopnea. He does report increased dyspnea and fatigue
on exertion since the summer.  He reports occasional ankle
edema, occasional PND (wakes up feeling like he is ""choking""),
occasional palpitations, and the feeling of
dizziness/lightheadedness when going from sitting to standing.

EKG [**2127-12-25**] at OSH: Sinus rhythm at a rate of 65. Q waves in
V3-V6, ST segment elevations in V2-V3, T wave inversions in
V2-V6.
.
EKG ([**12-26**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 69. Q waves in leads V2-V6
with deep biphasic T waves in leads V2-V6 suggest anterior wall
myocardial infarction, probably acute or subacute. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads.
.
ETT performed on [**2127-12-24**] demonstrated (OSH): 42 year old male
exercised on standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with Myoview for 4 minutes
and 30 seconds. Maximum heart rate achieved was 152 or 85%
predicted maximum. Maximum systolic blood pressure was 120/70.
The baseline EKG reveals normla sinus rhythm with nondiagnostic
inferior Q waves and probable age indeterminate anterior
mycardial infarct pattern. With exercise: the patient noted
fatigue and mild lightheadedness. There was a mild nondiagnostic
ST segment elevation superimposed upon the baselin changes in
the septal precordial leads. Pre and post exercise Myoview
cardiac SPECT imaging was obtained and reviewed.
CONCLUSION:
1. Nondiagnostic stress test for ischemia based on EKG criteria.
2. Review of the post stress and rest myocardiac SPECT images
demonstarte a large in size, sever in degree fixed anterior
apical wall infarct. There is a large in size, severe in degree
reversible inferior lateral wall defect. There is akinesis of
the apex. EF equals 30%.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2127-12-26**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had mild non flow limiting disease.  The LAD was totally
occluded after a small first diagonal.  The mid and distal LAD
as well as D2 filled via left to left and right to left
collaterals.  The Ramus had a 70%
proximal stenosis.  The LCx was totally occluded proximally.
The RCA
was a dominant vessel with a 30% stenosis in the mid segment.
2.  Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 34%
and
severe anterior/apical hypokinesis.  There was apical akinesis.
There
was no mitral regurgitation.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated a LVEDP of 9 mmHg.

Central aortic pressure was 103/71 (systolic/diastolic in mmHg).
 There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. CT surgery consult for CABG.
.
CXR PA/Lateral ([**12-26**]): IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic
pathology including no pneumonia or heart failure.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2127-12-29**] demonstrated: EF 35-40%,
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is an
inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls and akinesis of
the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum and apex. A
left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with multi-vessel coronary artery
disease. Small inferobasal LV aneurysm. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.

[**2127-12-30**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with Apical hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. Mild to
moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine and
phenylephrine and is being A paced
1. Bi ventricular function is unchanged from pre- CPB
2. MR is still mild to moderate.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are uncahnged

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27091**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-12-26**] for further
management of his chest pain and abnormal stress test. He
underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe two
vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical revascularization.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27091**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.
Plavix was stopped in anticipation of surgery. On [**2127-12-30**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 27091**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
separate dictated operative note for details. Postoperatively he
was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. By
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 27091**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically
intact and was extubated. He was then transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He did well postoperatively and was ready for
discharge home on POD #4.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was initially transferred to the trauma SICU. He was
found to have R intertrochanteric fx, L midshaft femur fx, R
calcaneal fx, B pulmonary contusion, and a liver lac.  He had
b/l chest tubes placed.  He had pinning R femur ([**4-14**]) by ortho.

Once transferred to the floor, he was taken to the OR on [**4-15**]
for L femur ORIF. In the PACU, he had decreased O2 sats in the
low 80s.  He was given O2 and monitored with a continuous O2
monitor and telemetry.  He was weaned off O2 throughout the
night and into the following am without complications.  It was
likely from his anesthesia.  His chest tubes were then pulled as
his ptx appeared to be resolved.  He had no other complications
regarding his pulmonary status.  His diet was slowly advanced
without complications. Ortho followed his while he was in-house
in which a short leg cast was placed on the right foot/ankle and
he was made NWB on the R and FWB on the L.  His foley catheter
was d/c'ed on [**4-17**], however, pt was unable to void.  After
placing a straight catheter, he had ~1300 ccs of UOP, therefore
his foley was replaced overnight.  On [**4-18**], his foley was d/c'ed
once again and pt was able to void on own. Pt was evaluated by
PT and OT to aid in NWB of R LE.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
female with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder,
status post excision, status post chemotherapy and radiation
following local recurrence, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] after a 3-week hospitalization in
[**Location (un) 34553**], [**State 108**] where she was with mental status changes
and renal failure.  As per the patient's husband, the patient
presented to urologist in [**State 108**] about one month ago with
symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection with nausea,
and vomiting, fevers, and dark urine.

On [**9-9**] she had an ultrasound that was consistent
with bilateral hydronephrosis and ureteral obstruction.  On
[**9-10**] the patient was admitted to [**Location (un) 34554**]
[**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 34553**], [**State 108**] with decreased
functional status, fatigue, nausea, low-grade fevers, and
decreased colostomy output.  The patient was found to have
evidence of colonic stool impaction and ileus and bilateral
hydronephrosis with a urinary tract infection.  The ileus was
presumed to be secondary to urosepsis.  Initially the patient
was treated with mineral oil and started on total parenteral
nutrition.  She was transfused packed red blood cells and
treated with antibiotics.  On [**9-11**] the patient became
increasingly disoriented, incoherent, and decreasing
responsive.  She had a magnetic resonance imaging of the head
that was negative for metastatic disease.  She had a CT of
the abdomen on [**9-11**] which showed dilated bowel loops
suggestive of obstruction with bilateral ectasia of renal
collecting septum.  She had a repeat abdominal CT on

[**2109-10-2**] with new 5-cm soft tissue density in the
right pelvis with a question of abscess versus hematoma
versus neoplasm.  On [**10-3**] a tagged red blood cell scan
was negative for localization to right upper quadrant and
right lower quadrant.  As per the husband, the medical team
planned a biopsy of the soft tissue density, but the husband
decided to drive his wife back to [**Name (NI) 86**] for her care.  He
does note her mental status has been poor for the last two to
three weeks but has had some days that are better than
others.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission white blood
cell count of 26.2, hematocrit 34, platelets 248;
93% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes.
Potassium 6.2, sodium 134, chloride 98, bicarbonate 23, blood
urea nitrogen 113, creatinine 3.5, glucose 80.  Calcium 11
(corrected to 12.2), albumin 2.5, magnesium 1.9,

cells, no epithelial cells, small blood.  Cultures were
pending.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with a rate of 75,
regular rhythm, normal axis, no P-T, and no acute ST-T wave
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient with an elevated white
count and low-grade fever suggestive of acute infectious
process, likely urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis.
The patient was started on Zosyn.  Later in her course when
she decompensated levofloxacin, Flagyl, and one dose of
vancomycin were added.  This was for presumed
hospital-acquired pneumonia that led to some respiratory
failure.

2.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient with a high
calcium likely secondary to renal failure and/or metastatic
disease.  The patient was treated with fluids, Lasix, and
pamidronate.  Also with hyperkalemia treated with Kayexalate
and insulin.  These eventually normalized.

3.  RENAL:  The patient with acute-on-chronic renal
insufficiency.  The patient with known bladder cancer.  She
had a right pelvic mass that was re-evaluated on magnetic
resonance imaging that was thought to be recurrence of tumor.
She had a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed during
her hospital course.  She also had a bone scan that showed no
metastatic disease to her bones.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient with initially elevated INR and
given vitamin K.

5.  RESPIRATORY:  The patient had respiratory decompensation
on [**2109-10-10**], with desaturations into the 80s on 100%
nonrebreather.  During that time the patient was tachycardic
up to the 200s and with elevated blood pressure.

The patient required intubation and was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for two days where she was stabilized and
additional antibiotic coverage was added.  She was extubated
successfully and transferred back to the floor with a comfort
measures only status.

The patient expired on [**2109-10-13**] at 7:50 p.m. with
respiratory failure.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Headache.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44 year-old woman with
history of multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2149**], maintained
on Avonex, who was in her usual state of health until one
week ago when she went in for an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography for gallstones.  Two days after her
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, she woke up
in the middle of the night with an acute headache involving
the back of her head.  This was very maximal onset and felt
like a punch in the back of the head.  The head pain was dull
and not throbbing.  This did not let up at all and two days
later she had some nausea and neck stiffness.  She did not
have any fever, chills, eye pain or bloody vision or other
visual symptoms.  She states that the headache is worse when
she cough or strains.  She has had vertigo in the past but
this is not the case now.  She went to the [**Hospital3 2358**]
Emergency Room yesterday for evaluation and received Demerol
25 mg times six as well as Versed, Phenergan, Dilaudid.  She
had a normal CT scan and a lumbar puncture which showed 0
white cells (tube number four had 10 white cells), 400 red
cells  (tube four had 240 red cells), glucose 49 and protein
55.  No opening pressure was recorded.  Afterward she felt
worse with the headache and it extended to the bifrontal
region.  She also received one dose of ceftriaxone for
meningitis coverage.  She currently has a 7 out of 10
headache pain.

She does report having occasional headaches around her period
located in the occiput.  There are no fevers, chills,
problems breathing or diarrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple sclerosis treated with
Avonex with past flares including numbness from the waist
down, blurred vision.  Per patient there were no spinal cord
lesions on imaging.  2) Avascular necrosis of bilateral
shoulders, status post shoulder replacement.  3) Tubal
ligation.  4) Two successful pregnancies, one miscarriage.
5) Gallstones.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Effexor 150 mg p.o. q.d., Avonex 30 mcg
intramuscularly q weekly, Flexeril 1 tablet p.o. q..s.,
Percocet p.r.n., Protonix 30 mg q.d., Ativan 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Rifampin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with her husband.  She is
a nonsmoker and does not drink alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no history of migraines.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission patient is afebrile,
blood pressure 110/80, heart rate 97, 100 percent on room
air. This is a well appearing obese female in mild distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  mucous membranes moist,
no carotid bruits are noted.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, no
murmur, rubs or gallops heard.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities no edema noted.  Skull and spine
neck movements are somewhat limited on lateral rotation, very
painful to palpation of the paraspinous soft tissue pressure
on the left.  On neurologic examination patient is attentive,
recalls three out of three objects at three minutes.  Has
good knowledge of her medical history.  Her language was
intact to naming, repetition and comprehension.  There is no
apraxia or agnosia.  On cranial nerve examination visual
acuity is 20 out of 25 in OD, OS and OU.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Optic disks are extremely difficult
to visualize given her discomfort and inability to keep the
eyes still.  There is no red desaturation.  Eye movements are
normal with deep pupil suggested in the left eye.  Pupils
react normally to light, good direct and consensual.
Sensation on face is intact to light touch and pinprick.
Facial movements are normal and symmetric.  Hearing is intact
throughout.  There is no nystagmus.  The palate elevates in
the midline.  The tongue protrudes in the midline and is of
normal appearance.  The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius
muscle are strong bilaterally.  On motor examination the
patient has normal tone and bulk.  She had full power 5 out
of 5 throughout.  There is no pronator drift.  On
coordination examination there is no ataxia.  The finger to
nose and heel to shin test are performed accurately.  On
reflexes are symmetrical and trace in upper extremities and
lower extremities bilaterally.  There is no ankle clonus.
Plantar responses are mute.  On sensory examination she is
intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature and joint
position of all extremities.  On the gait examination she had
narrow base gait.

IMAGING:  CT of the head at [**Hospital3 2358**] shows no obvious
hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was had another lumbar puncture
done in the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 188**].  Opening pressure was 9 cm water which was normal.
She has 518 red cells and the first two which decreased to
379 red cells in the fourth tube.  There were three white
cells with 35 percent neutrophils, 58 percent lymphocytes, 7
percent monocytes.  Protein was normal at 15, glucose normal
at 56.  An MRI-MRA was done which revealed no evidence of
aneurysm or infarct.  She did have a temperature of 100.4 and
complained of some paraspinal tenderness around the L4.  At
the encouragement of her primary care doctor, an MRI of the
thoracic and lumbar spine was done revealing no evidence of
epidural abscess.  Patient's headaches were managed with
morphine and Percocet and later switched over to Percocet
given the nausea secondary to the morphine.  She was also
given Reglan and Compazine for her nausea.  After four days
of hospitalization, patient was taken by the anesthesiology
pain service for a lumbar puncture and blood patch under
fluoroscopy.  The cerebrospinal fluid taken at this time
showed 10 white cells with 84 percent lymphocytes and 1
percent neutrophils.  There were 689 red cells, protein 46
and glucose of 49.  Given that the patient still had some
persistent red cells in her spinal fluid, we could not
definitively rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhoid or aneurysm.
Patient was then taken to angiography which revealed an
intracranial dissecting right vertebral artery aneurysm proximal
to the vertebrobasilar junction.  She was then transferred over
to the neurosurgery service for management of the aneurysm.

Upon transfer the diagnosis was a right vertebral dissecting
aneurysm.

TRANSFER CONDITION:  Stable.

Transferred to neurosurgery on [**2165-12-12**].

diminished.  Lasix 80 mg IV was given.  Sublingual
nitroglycerin times three was given for presumed congestive
heart failure.  On examination the temperature spiked to 103
degrees, tachypnea worsened, and the patient was intubated.
By family's report she was feeling okay recently, but over
the past month, she had had increased lower extremity edema
and Lasix dose had been increased.  She had an ""infection"" in
the lower extremity that was treated with antibiotics one
month ago.  Lately, she has had increased lower extremity
swelling with negative LENIs on [**2196-7-8**] and pain in both

STAT ADDEDNUM:

NOTE:  This addendum will include the hospital course and
disc medications and plan.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had been on a ventilator for
respiratory failure, diuresed and weaned on the vent over two
days.  She was extubated for four hours, increased tachypnea
and increased PCO2 and then reintubated, felt to be secondary
to flash pulmonary edema.  She diuresed aggressively over the
next 10 days and extubated in the setting of tight blood
pressure and heart rate control.  She had intermittent
wheezing felt secondary to cardiac asthma, responsive to
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Now, she is status post
extubation on the [**3-24**] and tolerating well.  Her
oxygen has been weaned down to 3 liters nasal cannula and she
has been on standing doses of Serevent and Atrovent, as well
as prn medications for wheezing.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  She had flash pulmonary edema which led
to the initial intubation, history of coronary artery disease
and congestive heart failure unclear given the patient
received majority of care in [**State 5111**].  Transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**7-12**] showed an ejection fraction greater
than 65% with 1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ MS, 1+ AS and 1+
aortic regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.  She
was felt to have the flash pulmonary edema secondary to
diastolic dysfunction.  She was aggressively diuresed over
the next 10 days with Lasix drip and 5.5 liters were removed
prior to extubation.  A pulmonary artery catheter guided
therapy with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures around 16.
Pulmonary artery pressures were approximately 50 to 70/25 to
30 at the time of discharge to the medical floor.  She was
extubated a second time with strict control of blood pressure
and heart rate with nitroglycerin drip, Nipride drip,
Diltiazem drip and Lasix drip.  She was weaned off drips
quickly three days prior to extubation and had increased
respiratory distress.  She is currently off all drips and
receiving Diltiazem and Isordil.  Lasix had been held because
of the increasing creatinine and will be restarted as an
outpatient.  ACE inhibitor was held also and may be restarted
at a later time when the creatinine is more stable.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Respiratory failure in the setting
of increased fevers, appeared to have a right hip cellulitis
which was treated with vancomycin and clindamycin for 10
days, resultant improvement in the erythema over the right
hip.  In addition, she was treated with a 10 day course of
Levaquin for pneumonia.  Sputum sample six days prior to
transfer to the floor grew out Acinetobacter, but the patient
was afebrile with normal white count, so it was not treated.
She has no signs of ventilator associated pneumonia and she
has been afebrile now for many days with a stable white
count.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a nasogastric tube
placed and was given tube feeds while in the unit.
Nasogastric lavage was trace positive on Protonix.  She
received one blood transfusion, but now had a stable
hematocrit for many days.  She is currently taking po, but
needs encouragement and may need intravenous fluids if her po
improvement does not improve.

5.  RENAL:  Slightly increased BUN and creatinine on
admission secondary to dehydration.  BUN and creatinine are
stable the majority of the hospitalization, but over the past
few days had increased slightly and now appears to be
decreasing again.  Probably it had increased because of over
diuresis and now appears stable at 1.9.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has -6.7
liters for the hospital course and had been on tube feeds and
is now tolerating diet well.  Suggest following patient's
weight, adjusting according to dry weight on admission to
rehabilitation.

7.  PSYCH:  The patient is anxious during hospitalization
with increased heart rate and blood pressure worsening her
diastolic dysfunction.  Prn Haldol and morphine have been
helpful.

8.  PAIN:  The patient has a history of polio and is on
OxyContin for pain relief.  She is also receiving morphine
initially and Neurontin has been added back for discharge.

CODE STATUS:  The patient was full code upon admission, but
is now DNR/DNI per the family's decision and the
communication should go through the patient's [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **].  Her number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 32585**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**] is the primary
care physician.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intensive Care, Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
57 y.o. male with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented
to [**Hospital1 **] with complaints of fatigue, ""low vision"" and
nausea, and decreased function of his hands, b/l hip pain,
constipation x 1 week.

While being worked up was found to have a low-grade fever (per
wife- baseline temp is 94-95F) and UTI for which he received
Ceftriaxone and Vancomcyin and was also hyponatremic to 120.

He was given NS and shortly thereafter had two seizures and bit
his tongue during one of them with bleeding and was thus
intubated for airway protection in addition to receiving a total
of 3 mg IV Ativan.

He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurological evaluation. Of
note, patient does not have a history of seizure disorder and is
not on seizure medications. He has had one seizure in the past,
in the setting of an infection. After arriving to [**Hospital1 18**], he was
evaluated by neurology who felt that the patient's seizure was
likely multifactorial in etiology with infection and
[**Hospital1 **] being the likely contributors. Meningitis was on
the differential, though not felt to be very likely and given
his clinical instability, an LP was deferred and Ceftriaxone and
Vancomycin were continued. Head CT was also unremarkable. He was
then admitted to the MICU for further management.

ROS: No HA. No menigismus. Inc confusion, clumsiness, low vision
(typical of infection per wife). Erythema around suprapubic cath
site, but no exudate.


Past Medical History:
MS - since [**2119**], progressive, quadriplegic, neurogenic bladder
with suprapubic catheter, restrictive [**Year (4 digits) 1570**]'s
History of Aspiration PNAs
Esophageal Ulcer - [**12-23**] NSAIDs, [**2139**], small bowel bx negative
Recurrent UTIs
CHF (EF > 65% with moderate LVH in '[**39**])
HTN
Legally Blind


Social History:
He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.  He has
three children and three grandchildren. He was a professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25931**] engineering at [**University/College 25932**], but
retired on disability after the [**2128**] spring semester due to his
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is wheelchair-bound.  He denies tobacco, alcohol, and
recreational drug use.  Has personal care assistant.



Family History:
Father had CAD and CVA. Mother has [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease. Brother
has diabetes.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 99.9, HR 71, BP 118/66, R 16, 98% intubated
Gen- obese, critically ill, bleeding from the mouth, intubated
and sedated.
HEENT: NCAT, R corneal hyphema at 3 0'clock, anicteric sclera,
blood from mouth, + tongue trauma.
NECK: no carotid bruits bilaterally, no nuchal rigidity.
CV: distant sounds, RRR, accentuated split S2, no MRG
PULM: CTA B
Abd: obese, RLQ with baclofen pump, + BS, ND
Extrem: generalized edema with 1+ pitting LE edema bilaterally
to
above the knee. 1+ dp pulses bilaterally.

NEUROLOGIC EXAM:
MS- occasionally chewing on ET tube. pt does not open eyes to
voice. he does not follow commands. he does not localize noxious
stimuli.

CN- PERRL 5-->3 sluggish, corneal reflex intact bilaterally,
when
eyelids are opened he has conjugate roving eye movements, he
does
not regard the examiner, oculocephalic reflex intact, brisk gag
reflex.

Motor- withdraws left arm purposefully to nailbed pressure, no
withdrawal to pain on left, nail bed pressure on right foot
induces clonus but no withdrawal, left foot nailbed pressure
results in slight withdrawal.

left toe muted, right babinski reflex induces clonus.

Sensory- as above in motor exam. withdraws R arm, grimace on L
arm, RLE clonus, LLE grimace.

Reflexes- clonus at R ankle, absent patellar reflexes, 2+
symmetric brachioradialis, unable to elicit bicep or triceps
reflexes.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Normal sinus at approximately 80, nl axis, nl PR, narrow
QRS, < 1 mm STD in II and TWI in III.

CT Head ([**3-6**]):
There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of
normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct,
or intracranial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate
opacification of the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology.

CXR ([**3-6**]): Limited study due to low lung volumes. Endotracheal
tube
terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. Retrocardiac
opacity may represent the combination of atelectasis and pleural
effusion, cannot rule out consolidation. Followup is
recommended.

EEG
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording, there is an
interhemispheric
asymmetry with more complex rhythms, at times with faster
frequencies,
noted on the left compared with a slightly lower voltage and
slower
frequency activity over the right side.

ABNORMALITY #2: The background was of low voltage, disorganized,
and
slow typically in the [**4-28**] Hz frequency range, admixed with
bursts of
generalized mixed frequency theta and delta frequency slowing.

BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were noted.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
interhemispheric asymmetry with somewhat more complex and faster

frequency rhythms noted broadly over the left side compared with
lower
voltage and slower frequency rhythms noted over the right. The
findings
suggest bilateral subcortical dysfunction which is more
prominent over
the right side. In addition, the background was disorganized,
low
voltage and slow with admixed bursts of generalized mixed
frequency
slowing with this constellation of findings being consistent
with a
diffuse moderately severe encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic

disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of
encephalopathy but there are others. There were no epileptiform
features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2140-10-3**], the findings are similar.

VIDEO SWALLOW
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

An oral and pharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in
conjunction with speech and pathology department. Under
continuous videofluoroscopy, barium of various consistencies was
administered orally to the patient.

ORAL PHASE: Mastication of solids was slow. There was reduction
in AP tongue movement secondary to weakness. Bolus control was
mildly reduced with premature spillover into the pharynx. A mild
coating of the oral cavity residue remained after the swallow.
This was cleared with repeat swallows.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There was mild delay in swallowing initiation.
Epiglottic deflection was incomplete, although NG tube presence
may have been partially responsible. Pharyngeal transit time was
normal, but pharyngeal constriction appeared mildly reduced. A
mild coating of residue remained in the vallecula and piriform
sinuses after liquids and solids. This was cleared with repeat
swallows.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was penetration before the swallow
with thin liquids, nectar thick liquids and pureed solids. There
was one trace aspiration episode after the swallow. A
spontaneous throat clear was effective in clearing the aspirated
material.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia.
2. Premature spillover, swallow delay and reduced pharyngeal
constriction.
3. Penetration before the swallow, with one episode of trace
aspiration.

CXR [**2142-3-15**]
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Nasogastric tube is seen with tip
overlying the stomach, with residual contrast material within
the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. Improved aeration
of the left base is noted. No definite consolidation identified,
although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the image.

IMPRESSION: Improved aeration of the left base. No definite
focal consolidations are identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 y.o. male with MS who presented wtih UTI and
[**Year (4 digits) **] s/p seizures x 2.


SEIZURES
Patient does not have a history of a seizure disorder though he
has had one seizure in the past, in the setting of an infection.
He was found to have both UTI and pneumonia (possibly
aspiration) on admission. Additionally, he was hyponatremic to
120. Both of these factors likely contributed to the patient's
seizures. CT head was unremarkable. Neuro followed during his
admission.  He was loaded with dilantin and then transitioned to
Keppra.  No further seizures during admission. He should
continue to increase his keppra per schedule up to 1500mg PO
BID, up 500mg/day every 3 days.

WEAKNESS / MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
At baseline he is wheelchair bound and unable to life his legs.
He can raise both of his arms antigravity, and is typically able
to operate the remote control with his right hand.

The patient was followed by neurology. He has LE weakness at
baseline (in a wheelchair) and ha owrsening UE weakness that was
starting to improve on discharge. Admission exam as detailed
above.  It was not felt that he was having an MS flare; he
should follow up with his MS doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**], within [**11-22**]
weeks of discharge.

[**Month/Day (2) **]
Possible etiologies included hypovolemic hypoNa and SIADH. Given
that this was symptomatic [**Month/Day (2) **] and not clearly
hypovolemic in nature, slow infusion of hypertonic saline was
used to increase sodium by [**2-24**] mEq.  Urine osmoles initially
above 500.  The lowest urine osmolarity achieved was 390 despite
normal volume status, suggesting SIADH as a component.  Renal
saw the patient and agreed with SIADH, recommending a high salt
diet. The importance of fluid restriction was discussed
(previously drinking 3 liters per day free water). However, if
the patient needs to drink copious amounts for his suprapub
catheter (as recommended by urology), then he should have high
salt, high protein diet. With mild fluid restriction, sodium
improved into mid to upper 130s.


UTI / PROTEUS, YEAST
Patient has a history of recurrent UTIs s/p suprapubic catheter.
 UA appeared infected rather than colonized given the high
amount of WBCs. Cultures from OSH grew Klebsiella sensitive to
ceftriaxone and he completed a 7 day course.  Suprapubic
catheter was changed on [**3-9**].

He had low grade temperature to 100.1 and was pancultured. His
urine continued to grow yeast, and he was started on 5 days of
fluconazole on [**2142-3-15**].

BLOOD CULTURES were drawn sevaral points during this admission
and have all been negative in house.

ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA
Had infiltrate, fever, and clear aspiration after seizing with
tongue trauma.  He was treated with a 7 day course of
ceftriaxone/metronidazole.  Sputum cultures did not isolate
pathogens.  Support for respiratory failure as detailed below.

The patient was evaluated for recurrent aspiration risk. A
modified soft solid diet with thin liquids was recommended after
video swallow.


RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Patient reportedly has a history of restrictive lung disease,
which is evidenced on CXR, though by history, he was only
intubated for airway protection in the setting of a seizure. He
initially had higher than anticipated oxygenation requirements,
but this improved with treatment of his pneumonia.  He was
extubated [**3-8**].

[**Hospital1 **]/PAP was used on the medical floor at home settings [**10-31**].

THROMBOCYTOSIS
The patient developed elevated platelet counts while in house.
This was felt to be reactive process, possibly from yeast UTI.

CHF
Appears euvolemic to mildly fluid-up.  Some evidence of
pulmonary and peripheral edema.  Echo showed mod LVH with EF
70%.


DYSAUTONOMIA
The patient's wife reports that he runs low temperatures, and
was very concerned about temperatures which were 98-99, which
she considered fever. He was pancultured for these in the ICU
but cultures were all negative or no growth to date.

He had several swings in his blood pressure, for which iv
medication for hypertensive urgency (BP 200/100) were avoided.

HTN
Initially with borderline hypotension requiring decrease in
hypertension regimen.  Eventually HTN worsened - added back home
regimen (clonidine and beta blockade) plus hydralazine and
amlodipine.  He was transitioned to carvedilol from lopressor.
BP was overall quite labile and required frequent adjustment of
his regimen.

History of Present Illness:
48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital
[**2168-3-13**] with complaints of fever on last Fri. Prior to
presentation, pt had fevers and UTI and was treated with 10 d of
levo (completed [**3-11**]). Initial CXR from [**Last Name (un) 4068**] demonstrated
enlarged L pleural effusion. While at [**Location (un) 620**], had CT chest
which demonstrated large pericardial effusion / L pleural
effusion. Was started on Ceftriaxone/Azithro to cover for Strep

diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis.
.
220 ml serosanguinous fluid was removed from pericardial sac,
pigtail was placed for continuous drainage. Effusion was thought
to be loculated.

Pertinent Results:
Pericardiocentesis [**2169-3-15**]:
1. Baseline resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
right sided pressures (RA mean 10 mmHg), normal pulmonary, and
normal
left sided pressures with a normal cardiac index (3.3 l/min/m2).
The
initial pericardial pressure equaled the RA pressure (10 mmHg).
2. Pericardiocentesis was performed and approximately 220 ml of
sero-sanguinous fluid was removed until pericardial pressure was
less
than 0. It was not possible to remove more fluid despite
posterior
positioning of the catheter. RA pressure following the
intervention was 5 mmHg. A pericardial catheter was left to
drain and the patient left the laboratory in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 F with PMH MS (wheelchair bound) presenting with intermittent
fevers, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion.
.
# Pericardial effusion and Cardiac:
Differential Dx:  Possibilities for etiology of pericardial and
pleural effusion include drug-induced hypersensitivity
(increased serum eosinophil count), drug effect (patient was
taking copaxone for years and zenapax for 4 months, both of
which deviates T cells to a Th2 response, which promotes an
eosinophilic response), infection (GPC in broth from pericardial
biopsy), and autoimmune disease (unusual presentation of lupus
or vasculitis to have isolated effusions).
.
On admission, a TTE showed a large possibly loculated
pericardial effusion (greater posteriorly - 3.5 cm compared with
anteriorly - 1.2 cm) that was echodense and consistent with
blood, inflammation and cellular elements without evidence of
tamponade.  The patient was taken to the cath lab for
pericardiocentesis with removal of 220 ml of serosanguinous
fluid and placement of a pigtail catheter.  Another 200 cc
drained on the floor before the catheter stopped draining and
was pulled on [**3-17**].  Analysis of the fluid was consistent with
an exudate (see pertinent results).  Cytology showed 79%
lymphocytes, some activated forms consistent with a reactive
process.  Microbiology studies showed no bacterial or fungal
growth.  Acid fast culture continues to show NGTD, but the AFB
smear was negative.  Following pericardiocentesis and drainage,
she continued to have a large circumferential pericardial
effusion by TTE without signs of tamponade.  Repeat pulsus
checks were consistently 6.  CT surgery performed VATS to
evacuate the pericardial effusion without complication. TTE
showed EF 70%, 1+ MR, 1+ TR.
.
All autoimmune and vasculitic markers checked returned negative.
Pericardial biopsy showed Gram positive cocci only growing in
broth, which may be contamination. Biopsy showed lymphocytes,
degranulating eosinophils, and a few scattered PMNs.  Tissue
culture needs to be followed after discharge, although the
effusion is unlikely to be caused by a bacterial infection
because the patient has clinically been asymptomatic other than
fevers.
.
# Pleural effusion:
Pt has had fevers and 20 lb weight loss over the last several
weeks.  To evaluate for a source of possible malignancy and L
pleural effusion seen on CXR, she was sent for a CT with IV and
oral contrast following the pericardiocentesis which showed a
large left pleural exudative effusion, small right pleural
effusion, indeterminant 1.4-cm adrenal nodule, dilated common
duct measuring 7-8 mm with no obvious obstructing source.  The L
pleural effusion was tapped 1L by interventional pulmonology,
revealing straw-colored, clear fluid.  There was no pus noted in
the pericardial or pleural fluid.  Patient was asymptomatic
before and after procedure, with >95% O2 sat.
.
# Fevers:
Etiology unknown.  Fevers up to 103 were intermittent, and
patient would spike once a day and then remain afebrile for the
remainder of the day.  Patient's fever improved after surgical
evacuation of pericardial effusion, with maximum temp 99.5
during last day.
.
# Multiple sclerosis:
Patient was advised to follow up with her neurologist and stop
taking Copaxone (glatiramer) HS and Zenapax for life. Patient
will continue to take Baclofen 60 [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Osteoporosis:
Fosamax and Ca carb were held during admission, but may be
continued after discharge.
.
# Anxiety:
Paxil and Zyprexa prn were continued during admission.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] is a 58 yo m w/ multiple sclerosis and seizure
disorder who presented to an OSH for delusions and AMS x 2 days.
At OSH, he was noted to have a Na of 124. He does have a history
of hyponatremia; he had a Na of 117 in [**2-27**] but had been in the
mid 130s since then. He has seen nephrology. At the OSH, he had
an approx 45sec generalized tonic clonic seizure, received 1mg
Ativan, and transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**]. He also has a
history of seizures especially in the setting of infection and
hyponatremia. It is unclear if he has had seizures without an
inciting event. He is currently being weaned off of Keppra and
Gabapentin and is being started on Tegretol. In the ER, his VS
were: 97.5; 189/105; 78; 16; 95% 3L. He was given 2L of NS.
Given that he has had AMS in the setting of infection and is
known to have chronic UTIs [**12-24**] indwelling suprapubic catheter
and neurogenic bladder, blood and urine cultures were obtained
as well as a CXR. He had a urine culture from [**11-28**] that grew
pseudomonas and his CXR showed a possible infiltrate and he was
treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A head CT was negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo male w/ progressive multiple sclerosis was admitted for
AMS and seizure after having a 45s GTC at the OSH that responded
to 1mg Ativan.  He had a negative head CT but was found to have
a Na level of 126.  He has been hyponatremic in the past and
this has often caused changes in his mental status.  In the ED,
he was treated with 2L NS for concern of hypovolemic
hyponatremia.  At that time, his urine osm was 423 and serum osm
was 263. He also had a CXR and there was prelim concern for
pneumonia which can cause an ADH like effect (the final read was
neagtive).  Neurology was consulted for his AMS and seizure and
they felt that his hyponatremia was likely related to recent
initiation of carbamezapine for sensory illusions.
Carbamezapine has a known ADH like effect and can cause
hyponatremia.  Following discontinuation of carbamezapine along
with fluid restriction, his Na increased.  After several days,
the pt appeared slightly dehydrated so his fluid restriction was
lifted. By time of discharge, his serum Na was 140.
.
In the past, his seizures have been instigated by an underlying
infection. However, upon admission he was afebrile and did not
have a leukocystosis.  The most likely source was either
pneumonia or a UTI.  He has a suprapubic catheter [**12-24**] neurogenic
bladder and on the day prior to admission, he had a urine sample
that grew pseudomonas, a bacteria he has had in the past.  He
has also had several pneumonias in the past, most likely [**12-24**]
frequent aspirations and his first CXR was concerning for lung
infiltrate.  He was treated with one dose of vancomycin and
cefepime for pneumonia.  Ultimately, repeat CXR and a CTA were
both negative for pneumonia.
.
Because of his pseudomonal bacteriuria, he was started on
ciprofloxacin. A urine culture drawn prior to abx inititian also
grew pseudomonas.  Because he was afebrile and did not have a
leukocytosis and there was thought that it may actually have
been colonization as opposed to infection.  However, he was
treated with a full course of cipro for a complicated UTI.  His
catheter was changed and all other cultures remained negative.

.
On admission, the pt was afebrile and hypertensive to 180-200.
However, shortly after arriving on the floor, he had an episode
of hypotension down to the 70's systolic.  During this time he
was mentating well, he did not have any complaints, denied chest
pain, headache, and visual changes.  IVFs were given, however
the hypotension did not initially respond, however came up
eventually prior to getting to the ICU.  This labile blood
pressure was most likely secondary to the patient's autonomic
dysfunction secondary to his SPMS. Other considerations were
infection or possible sepsis, however the patient was continued
to be afebrile. Blood and urine cultures were negative. He was
monitored in the ICU for 24 hours with stable swings in BP which
were asymptomatic and consistent with autonomic dysfunction.
Changed clonidine dosing from 0.2mg [**Hospital1 **] to 0.1mg TID.
Maintained other blood pressure medications at home doses.
.
The next day, he was transferred out of the MICU and returned to
the floor.  Shortly after arrival, he developed a fever.  More
blood and urine cultures were sent and all were negative.
Pneumonia had been ruled out and his UTI was being treated with
a medication that was appropriate per sensitivities.  He had a
CTA which was negative for PE.  However, he was started on
meropenem and was treated for 2 days.  He was still slightly
febrile but his meropenem was discontinued for concern of drug
fever.  He defervesced without any further treatment.
.
However, his mental status continued to fluctuate despite being
afebrile, no obvious source of infection, and he was eunatremic.
 He was occasionally aggressive and would say that he was being
murdered or kidnapped.  Neurology was reconsulted but did not
feel that his symptoms were related to the keppra and they did
not think he was having subclinical seizures.  He continued to
have repetitive shaking moves of his head but he was conscious
and able to speak during these episodes. Also, despite the
Keppra, he continued to have sensory illusions, mostly centered
around the feeling of having a bowel movement (when he actually
was not).
.
During the work up for a source of infection and source of AMS,
he had a CTA which revealed a liver lesion.  He had an
ultrasound and a multiphase liver CT to further describe the
lesion because he cannot have an MRI [**12-24**] an implanted baclofen
pump.   Mr [**Known lastname 25925**] and his family decided to not biopsy the lesion
at this time but it was not ruled out completely for malignancy,
although unlikely.  During this work up he also had KUB that was
concerning for ileus but he continued to have BMs so he was kept
on a regular diet.
.
Prior to discharge, his mental status had not completely
returned to baseline but he was alert and oriented x 3 and was
no longer aggressive towards staff.  No definite etiology was
elucidated and it was hypothesized that this could be a result
of the progression of his established disease.

This is a 58 year old male with progressive end stage multiple
sclerosis with chronic pain, central sleep apnea, recurrent
UTIs, history of seizures in the setting of hyponatremia,
admitted for AMS, increased sputum production following witness
aspiration episode. Hospitalized a week ago for seizures with
hyponatremia neurology had changed his medication from Keppra to
Lamictal. On a Keppra wean. Per wife pt this morning was
producing a lot of sputum which he appeared to be aspirating.
Wife called [**Name2 (NI) 269**] to evaluate his lungs as he produced even more
sputum following this witnessed aspiration episode. [**Name2 (NI) 269**]
reportedly told wife that he seemed ""crackly"" and recommended
they go to the ED at [**Location (un) 620**]. As the day progressed pt's wife
noted that was becoming more and more lethargic. A CXR at
[**Location (un) 620**] showed a LLL infiltrate, ?pleural effusion. A WBC of
20.9 was also noted with 16 bands. Pt was transferred from

IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral consolidation of the bilateral
basilar lower lobes compatible with provided history of
aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Slight improvement in aeration
at the left lung base.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year-old Male with end stage [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] for
LLL PNA, general weakness. Admitted to the ICU for concern
regarding general weakness, increased secretions.

# Aspiration pneumonia-  Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] was admitted with
leukocytosis of 18.3 which is lower than his WBC of 20 at
[**Location (un) 620**] after an aspiration event with his BIPAP.  Pt had a
witnessed aspiration which is highly suspicious for the cause of
his PNA. He was for initially started on azithromycin,
clindamycin and levofloxacin, which was changed to
flagyl/levofloxacin.  He produced significant sputum, and was
hypoxic.  This was consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Speech and swallow was consulted, patient being placed on a diet
previously recommended by speech and swallow during his last
admission.  Given the nature of the event, while he was on
BIPAP, the sleep service was consulted and recommended nasal
bipap at night.  He was trialed on that while in the hospital,
but needs a mask refitted which will be performed by his
respiratory care company.  He was sent home on just nocturnal
oxygen to be provided via his BIPAP machine, until his nasal
mask is refitted.  By the time of discharge, he was off oxygen,
and clinically improved.  He was set up with suction at home to
help with his secretions.  He did not have a formal video
swallow study as he is unwilling to have a feeding tube placed.
He was placed on aspiration precautions and an aspiration diet.
He remains at high risk for recurrent events given his advanced
MS, and he may have to ultimately be discontinued off of BIPAP,
and have further changes to his diet.

.
# Funguria:  His initial UA was positive for yeast.  He has an
indwelling suprapubic catheter.   He was seen by Dr.[**Name (NI) 10529**]
service, who recommended treatment with 10 days of fluconazole,
and then reassessing for clearance of the yeast.  He has a
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3 weeks.
.
# Encephalopathy:  He had worsening of his mental status in the
setting of acute illness, but returned to his baseline with
treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
.
# [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Pt was recently admitted last week for [**Last Name (STitle) 862**]
activity in the setting of hyponatremia. Per family hyponatremia
was thought to be due to Tegretola dn pt was switched to Keppra
whilst on the Neurology service. Unfortunately Keppra made him
too sleepy, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 25950**] note a day prior to admission, Mr.
[**Known lastname 25925**] was pleced on a wean to start him on Lamotrigine.  He was
continued to be weaned off Keppra to Lamotrigine per Neuro recs.
Will cotninue Keppra and start Lamotrigine 25mg daily x 1 week
and keep on same Keppra dose.

# Multiple Sclerosis: He was treated with baclofen through his
pump (will need to be changed next thursday) as well as physical
therapy.

# Autonomic Dysfunction: Pt's home BPs are extremely labile
running anywhere from low 80s to high 150s-160s. Pt currently on
Clonidine patch and Carvedilol for BP control as an outpatient.
He was continued on these medications.

# Lower Extremity Edema: Pt has chronic LE edema for which he
takes Furosemide and wears [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings.  He was continued on
compression stockings and his home dose of Furosemide 20mg
daily.

# Deafferentation-type sensory illusion syndrome: Syndrome is a
result from terminal degenerative disease, pt believes in
illusions that pertain to his body such as the sensation of
having BMs, feeling itchy. Neurology had commented on this
during pt's last admission, only recommended therapy was to
continuing the use of his antiepileptic therapy.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-3-9**],
the findings are similar.

Video Swallow:
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Limited evaluation due to patient positioning
and poor
visualization of the structures. However, pharyngeal phase
demonstrated mild residue in the valleculae after puree and
solid boluses which cleared with sips of liquid. Pharyngeal
phase was within normal limits for swallow
initiation, palatal elevation, laryngeal valve closure,
epiglottic deflection, and bolus propulsion. Please note,
piriform sinuses or upper esophageal sphincter was not imaged.

AP POSITION: Not able to be obtained.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Laryngeal penetration of thin liquids
via teaspoon
and aspiration of thin liquids via straw occurred due to
premature spillover. Patient had coughing which cleared
aspirated material.
IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia as described above.
Please see
speech pathology note for further details.

CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2143-2-1**]
obtained at 03:40 a.m. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal
position, contour and width are unremarkable. Slight worsening
in bibasilar opacities might represent worsening of atelectasis,
although bilateral, in particular on the left aspiration cannot
be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
evidence of failure is present. Followup with chest radiograph
to exclude the possibility of worsening basal pneumonia is
recommended.

LENI:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58yo man w hc chronic progressive MS, quadriplegia, hx
aspiration PNA, chronic foley who was transferred from OSH ED
with increasing fatigue and productive cough.
.
# Progressive fatigue and cough - Patient had recently been in a
hospital and was still being treated with cefpodoxime and flagyl
for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.  There was a concern for a
worsening pneumonia and was changed to levo flagyl until his
cultures were negative.  He was then changed back to
cefpodoxime/flagyl and completed his ten day course while in
house.  He was seen by speech and swallow who recommended that
his liquids be thickened.
.
# Cards: He has hx of chronic diastolic CHF. EKG without
ischemic changes. Pt without chest pain. Troponin elevated but
CK normal.  His troponin continued to be high.  This was thought
to be related to demend ischemia in the setting of labile
hypertension.
.
# HTN: Continue coreg but at 1/2 dose. Continue clonidine.  His
blood pressures were difficult to control and at times he
required extra doses of hydralazine to bring his blood pressure
down.  No hypertensive medications were changed.
.
# MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of seizures: Continue lamictal. Recently titrated
off of keppra. He had a [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] in house and neurology was
consulted.  They recommended adding back keppra and increasing
the dose of lamictal.  This was done and he can continue to have
his keppra taper and increase lamictal as outpatient.
.
# Resp: continue nebs. BiPAP at night for OSA
.
# Autonomic Dysfunction: hx of labile BPs. Monitor and continue
meds as above.
.
# Lower Extremity Edema: Pt has chronic LE edema. His lasix were
initially held in the setting of concern for an infection.  They
were restarted and he was discharged on his home dose of lasix.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with progressive end stage multiple
sclerosis with chronic pain, central sleep apnea, recurrent
UTIs, history of seizures in the setting of hyponatremia,
admitted for AMS.
.
Pt with multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] ICUs, including last
week for aspiration pneumonia. He was discharged home on feeding
restriction and was doing well until 1 day prior to admission
when he was noted to be less responsive and have bleeding from
his tongue. Although there was no witnessed tonic clonic
movement, this was concerning for [**Hospital1 862**] activity which he
generally has in setting of hyponateremia or infection. Pt was
reportedly more confused and lethargic than baseline, grunting
in bed rather than interactive.
.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] wife called his neurologist, who asked to cont meds (except
hold seroquel) and have labs checked to rule out infection
sparked [**Name (NI) 862**]. He was then brought to [**Location (un) **] ED, where CXR
showed RLL PNA, and also UTI (bac and WBC in urine--chronic
suprapubic foley though). On exam he was SOB, had secretions and
harsh upper airway sounds, with productive cough. He was given
unasyn, solumedrol, albuterol, 1L NS and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On arrival here, pt with temp of 96.2, HR 88, BP 215/123--to

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year-old Male with end stage [**Hospital **] transferred from
[**Location (un) **] for LLL PNA, UTI, admitted to ICU for large O2
requirement.

## AMS: due to infection, most likely.  Improved with abx.
therapy (see below).  Neurology consulted for ? [**Location (un) 862**].  AEDs
titrated up (see below).  No overt evidence of [**Location (un) 862**] seen.

## UTI: UA at [**Location (un) **] with large leuk esterase, poisitve
nitrites, mod bacteria, 1 epi.  No leukocytosis. Urine culture
here grew a small amount (~8000/mL) of GNRs.  Unclear if this
represents true infection given indwelling (suprapubic)
catheter, and more likely source of infection is aspiration
pneumonia; antibiotics given for pneumonia would likely treat
urine GNR at any rate.

## End Stage Multiple Sclerosis: had a two hour family meeting
with pt., wife, son, son-in-law, neurology fellow, palliative
care team, social work, and myself to discuss goals of care and
plan moving forward to minimize recurrent hospitalizations.  PEG
tube discussed and decided against this (pt. does not want).
Palliative care to come to pt.s home to discuss palliative
approach and care further.  Cont. diet modifications as rec. by
speech therapist.  See OMR note by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] detailing this
meeting further.

This was verbally relayed to his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **].  She agrees.  I
also mentioned the following possibilities to her for
consideration:  home antibiotics to take if high clinical
suspicion for aspiration pna and or cystitis; levsin q hs to
reduce secretions, however, in my opinion, this may cause more
harm than good through decreasing gut motility and increasing
the risk of reflux aspiration.

Medication list greatly simplified.  All non essential
medications removed due to aspiration risk (to minimize number
and frequency of med administration and to have as many be
liquid or crushable as possible).

Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 88-year-old white male with
history of congestive heart failure, multiple sclerosis and
neurogenic bladder with an indwelling Foley catheter
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with fever and
hypertension.  The patient was initially transferred from the
nursing home to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency
Department because the patient's chronic indwelling Foley
catheter had come out.  After unsuccessful attempts to
replace the Foley by the Emergency Department staff, as well
as the urology service.  A cystoscopy was performed by
urology.  This revealed multiple urethral strictures.
Following this, a suprapubic tube was placed by urology.  The
patient was initially planned to go back to the nursing home,
but then decompensated spiking a fever to 101.8?????? with a heart
rate of 110 along with a blood pressure of 70/palpation.  The
patient was initially given intravenous fluid boluses and
then begun on a dopamine drip.  He was given doses of
ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  Upon arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the patient reported mild abdominal
pain, but denied shortness of breath. There was a report of
greenish sputum produced in the Emergency Department.
However, the patient denied chest pain or trouble breathing.

ADMITTING PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature current 100.2??????, heart rate 82,
blood pressure 113/51, respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation
100% on 2 liters.
GENERAL:  Elderly, frail white male in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Mucous membranes mildly
dry.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with occasional beats, S1 and
S2 audible with S4 gallop.
LUNGS:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft with mild periumbilical tenderness to
palpation (appropriate given suprapubic tube), nondistended,
no masses.  Active bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Calf soft, nontender.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented to person, but not place or
time.

ADMITTING LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.0,
hematocrit 41.5.  Sodium 141, potassium 5.1, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 29, creatinine 0.9, glucose 106, INR 1.2,
PTT 28.  Urinalysis notable for leukocytes, large blood,
large protein 30, red blood cells 21 to 50, white blood cells
greater than 50, epithelial cells 0, bacteria many.

RADIOLOGIC:  Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 124
with left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block.  Qs
in 3, F, V5 and V6 without acute change compared to [**Month (only) **] of
'[**91**]. Chest x-ray with a right lower lobe opacification,
increased bilateral interstitial markings with mild hilar
engorgement.  Chest CT with bibasilar opacifications, right
greater than left, atelectasis versus aspiration versus
pneumonia, distal aortic aneurysm.  Abdomen and pelvis CT
distal nonobstructive IVC thrombus without evidence of free
air or fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular/Hemodynamic:  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a presumed diagnosis of
sepsis from a likely urinary tract infection and potentially
a pneumonia.  Upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit in the
Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure remained
quite labile often cycling from a systolic of 80 to 130 over
the course of several minutes.  During these cycling
episodes, even with low blood pressure, the patient remained
tachycardic with no change in his mental status or
oxygenation.  It was concluded that his highly labile blood
pressures could very likely be secondary to underlying
autonomic dysfunction given his multiple sclerosis with
urinary and gastrointestinal involvement.  As a result, the
patient's pressors were weaned off very quickly and required
minimal fluid boluses for blood pressure control.  During
this admission, the patient appeared to tolerate a systolic
blood pressure in the 80s without tachycardia or symptoms.
During this admission, his Lasix and his Vasotec was held.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient remained on minimal supplemental
oxygenation without desaturation.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient defervesced over the
course of his admission.  His urinalysis revealed a urinary
tract infection and is felt to be the most likely source of
his bacteremia, given his genitourinary manipulation and
pneumonia was also diagnosed on chest x-ray.  At the time of
this dictation, all cultures remained negative.  The patient
was changed to Levaquin po for coverage of his community
acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection.  Because of
potential for bacterial seeding of his genitourinary tract,
he was recommended to complete a 14 day course.

4.  Hematologic:  A distal IVC thrombus was noted in the
patient as an incidental finding on his abdominal CT.  This
was felt by the radiology interpretation to be chronic rather
than acute.  Given the patient's multiple comorbidities an
desire for minimal amounts of treatments and potentially
invasive procedures, Coumadin or any kind of anticoagulation
will be deferred at this time.

5.  Neurological:  The patient was continued on his
Neurontin, Sinemet and Dilantin.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient
tolerated a soft pureed diet with thickened liquids and was
to remain on aspiration precautions.

7.  Genitourinary:  The patient's suprapubic tubes remained
in place.  As per the urology service, this will remain in
place for six weeks until he will follow up in urology clinic
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8872**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 24252**].

8.  Disposition/Code status:  After extensive discussions
were held with the patient's doctor, Mrs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
and her husband, along with the patient's primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 24253**], the patient's code status was
confirmed as DNR/DNI.  Because of his age, multiple
comorbidities, very frequent hospital admissions and the
desire to minimize any and all invasive and/or stressful
procedure, the decision was made that should the patient be
hospitalized again he specifically request that he not be
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and not have any
central lines placed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 469**] is a 76-year-old
woman with a history of end stage multiple sclerosis and
quadriplegia with dysphasia, decubitus ulcers, bilateral
pleural effusions and ascites, and a recent admission on
[**12-2**] for sepsis, who presented to the [**Hospital3 **] with
hypoxia requiring intubation and hypotension requiring
dopamine.  She had recently been admitted on [**12-2**]
through [**12-8**] with sepsis secondary to Prevotella and
Peptostreptococcus requiring a one day Medical Intensive Care
Unit stay.  She was discharged on [**12-8**] to [**Hospital3 6373**] on a regimen of vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl for a planned five week course.  At that time, the
patient was noted to have ascites and bilateral pleural
effusions which were not tapped.

On [**12-9**], while at [**Hospital1 **], her husband noticed the
patient reportedly to have aspirated secretions.  Her oxygen
saturations acutely dropping to 47%, which bumped to 96% on
100% nonrebreather.  She was transferred to the Emergency
Room where her vital signs were blood pressure 133/85, heart
rate 122, saturating at 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  The
patient was noted to rapidly deteriorate.  Her respiratory
rate rose into the 40s with significant hypoventilation
prompting her to be intubated.  With this, her blood pressure
dropped to 40/20.  She responded transiently to boluses of
normal saline intravenous fluids, but needed a dopamine drip
to be started in the Emergency Room.

A right IJ central line was placed and resulted in a
right-sided pneumothorax.  A right side chest tube was placed
draining 800 cc of clear yellow pleural fluid.

Subsequent to this, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End stage multiple sclerosis times 17 years, aphonia,
dysphasia, quadriplegia.
2.  Decubitus ulcers, Stage 4., thoracic and sacral.
3.  Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
4.  Incontinence.
5.  Fibroids.
6.  Ascites.
7.  Hyponatremia.
8.  History of sepsis.
9.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
10. History of atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Insulin sliding scale.
2.  Bowel regimen.
3.  Ambien 5 mg po q.h.s.
4.  Heparin subcutaneously.
5.  Vitamin C.
6.  Zinc.
7.  Multivitamins.
8.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 intravenously.
9.  Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d.
10. Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously q.d.
11. Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg q. 4 hours prn for pain.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco, no alcohol, [**Hospital1 595**]
speaking only, presently nonverbal, prior to her most recent
hospitalization, she had been living with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature was 98.6.  Her
blood pressure when examined on dopamine was 122/99.  Her
heart rate 115.  Respiratory rate of 15, intubated,
saturating at 97% on vent settings of assist control
500/12/5/1.0.  At this point her dopamine was at 10
mcg/kg/minute.  In general, flaccid, extremely cachectic
female, ill-appearing, significant blanching, mottling in a
reticular pattern over her anterior torso, bilateral upper
extremities, intubated and sedated at this time.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  She was edentulous.  An
ET tube was in place and secured.  She had a right IJ central
line in place.  Her lungs had right basilar rales, decreased
breath sounds at the left base.  Her heart rate and rhythm
were regular, but tachycardic and with distant heart sounds.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  She had no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Bowel sounds were present.  She had
flaccid muscle tone.  Her extremities had 2+ pitting edema,
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  A left PICC line was
in place with more edema on the left upper extremity than the
right.  Her left calf had a bandage which was clean, dry and
intact.  She had a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer, 2 cm thoracic, 4
cm sacral.  Neurologically, she was completely flaccid with
no muscle tone.  Her left arm had a deformity and was
contracted.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.2,
hematocrit 30.2, platelet count 514,000.  Sodium 133,
potassium 3.9, BUN 19, creatinine 0.4 up from a baseline of
0.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 30, calcium 7.4, magnesium 1.7,
phosphorus 2.7.  Urinalysis was clean.  An arterial blood gas
showed 7.44/43/330 on assist control 500/12/5/1.0.  Her
lactate was 2.3.

IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  Chest x-ray showed a moderate sized
right-sided pneumothorax.  An ET tube was in place.  PICC
line and right IJ lines were in place.  She had bilateral
pleural effusions.  A chest x-ray from two hours earlier,
prior to the line placement, showed no pneumothorax.  An
electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia in the 130s with
T wave inversions in II, III, V4 through V6, T wave
flattening in III, V3, no ST changes, no Qs, normal axis,
normal intervals, no evidence of right heart strain.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Intensive Care Unit, she
was rapidly weaned off pressors and extubated on the 29th.
She was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, Flagyl,
Ceftriaxone and vancomycin as per her prior infectious
course.  This was a presumed aspiration event and these
antibiotics were presumed to be sufficient to cover any
superimposed bacterial infection.

Subsequent to extubation, she was called out to the floor
where she initially did well, however, on the 31st, she had
an episode of decompensation with hypoxia to the mid 80s,
placed on a nonrebreather face mask.  A chest x-ray showed
that she had an almost complete white out of her left lung
consistent with either new consolidation or large pleural
effusion.  She was maintained on oxygen overnight.  The
following morning, thoracentesis was performed.  A liter and
a half of serous fluid was removed with resolution of much of
her shortness of breath and hypoxia.  Follow-up chest x-ray
showed almost complete resolution of the white out of her
lung.  However, she has continued to have bilateral pleural
effusions.

Her decubitus ulcers were continued with their existing
management.  Plastic Surgery was consulted for evaluation of
these wounds and proper dressing. They continued with
wet-to-dry packing and no changes were made to her management.

At the time of this dictation, she has a continued sacral
decubitus, a thoracic decubitus, both unchanged from her
prior admission, as well as small wound in her left axillary
line where a chest tube was placed.  This is healing well.

Her neurological status has been stable with severe neurologic
compromise. She does have end stage multiple sclerosis and is
immobile and bedbound.  Despite her inevitable decline, her
family has expressed strongly their desire to have all
interventions performed including intubation, and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation should she require it.  This
issue will need to be discussed further with them as there is
likely little utility in performing CPR.

In terms of nutrition, she has been maintained on tube feeds
through an nasogastric tube.  Of note, the Gastrointestinal
Service has been spoken with on several occasions about the
possible placement of a percutaneous feeding tube, either in the
stomach, or the jejunum.  The feeling of multiple attendings and
the Gastroenterology Service has been that this is not indicated
and that the risks of having a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube in a patient with ascites far outweigh the
benefits.  At this time, the plan is to continue tube feedings
via the nasogastric tube.

At the time of this dictation, the plan is for her to be
discharged to a long-term care facility, most likely [**Hospital **]
Hospital to receive continued care.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End stage multiple sclerosis.
2.  Aspiration pneumonia.
3.  Respiratory failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Malnutrition.
6.  Pleural effusions.
7.  Stage 4 decubital ulcers.

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
white female with a past medical history significant for
end-stage multiple sclerosis, decubitus ulcers, atrial
tachycardia, who presents with hypoxia from [**Hospital3 6373**] Center.  The patient was recently admitted for
sepsis secondary to decubitus ulcers.  She was discharged on
[**2176-12-7**] with an extended course of broad spectrum
antibiotics.

She presents the day after discharge with an episode of
hypoxia at her rehabilitation facility.  The patient was
noticed to have an aspiration event by the husband who was at
the bedside.  Following this, she had some coughing and was
found to be hypoxic with 02 saturation at 47% on room air by
the medical staff.  The patient was placed on a
nonrebreathing with improved saturations to 96%.  However,
the patient remained tachypneic and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further workup and
management.

Upon arriving in the Emergency Department, the patient was
initially on a 100% nonrebreather with good oxygenation at
98%.  However, she then developed significant tachypnea with
respiratory rate into the 40s.  She maintained her
respiratory rate for some time; however, then began to have
decreased rate, eventually dropping to less than ten.  She
was finally noticed to be apneic and was intubated.
Approximately 30 minutes after the intubation, the patient
became severely hypotensive with systolic blood pressure at
40.  The patient responded to 1 liter of normal saline and a
dopamine drip at 10 micrograms.  Central venous access was
obtained.  A subsequent chest x-ray showed a small to
moderate right-sided pneumothorax.  A chest tube was placed
at this time with withdrawal of 800 cc of clear yellow
pleural fluid.

On mechanical ventilation, the patient initially had
oxygenation and was hemodynamically stable.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.
2.  Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d.
3.  Vancomycin 1 gram q.d.
4.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
5.  Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
6.  Subcutaneous heparin.
7.  Multivitamins.
8.  Senna.
9.  Colace.
10. Vitamin C.
11. Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg q. four hours p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of tobacco or alcohol use.  The
patient is a [**Hospital6 595**]-speaking female, although she has been
nonverbal secondary to her multiple sclerosis.  She had been
living with her husband until her recent admission and
transfer to the [**Hospital3 **] Facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.6, blood pressure 122/99, pulse 118, respiratory rate 15,
02 saturation 97% on assist control ventilation with tidal
volume of 500 cc, respiratory rate of 12, positive
end-expiratory pressure of 5, FI02 of 100%.  General:  The
patient was flaccid and extremely cachectic and ill
appearing.  The patient had a significant blanching rash in a
reticular pattern over the anterior torso and bilateral upper
extremities.  HEENT:  The patient was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Her pupils were equally round, and reactive to
light.  Lungs:  The patient had right basilar rales with
decreased breath sounds at the left base, otherwise clear.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac with a regular rate, distant
heart sounds.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  The patient had 2+ pitting edema of the
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  There is a left PICC
line in place.  Skin:  The patient has stage IV decubitus
ulcers at the sacrum and at the thoracic spine.  Neurologic:
the patient is completely flaccid with no muscle tone.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  CBC revealed a white blood cell
count of 9.2, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 514,000.
Chemistries of significance were a chloride of 99,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 19, creatinine 0.4, calcium 7.4,
phosphate 1.7.

Microbiology studies:  The patient had positive blood
cultures from a previous admission on [**2176-12-1**].  She
had one out of two bottles positive for Prevotella and one
out of two bottles positive for pepto streptococcus.  Her
urine cultures from previous admission were negative.  Repeat
blood culture on [**2176-12-3**] was also negative.

Chest x-ray:  The patient had a moderate right-sided
pneumothorax, as previously mentioned.  There were moderate
bilateral pleural effusions.

EKG showed tachycardia with rate in the 130s with T wave
inversions in II, III, V4 through V6 and no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Initially, the patient was intubated due to her respiratory
failure.  She did well initially on mechanical ventilation
and was able to be weaned off without difficulty. The patient
was extubated on hospital day number two and subsequently had
good respiratory function and oxygenation.  She was continued
on her previous broad spectrum antibiotics for a history of
sepsis as well as for a possible new aspiration pneumonia.

2.  HYPOTENSION:  The patient was hypotensive after her
intubation.  This was likely secondary to initiation of
positive pressure ventilation, perhaps in combination with
medications that she received prior to the intubation.  She
was quickly weaned off the dopamine and maintained good blood
pressure off the pressors.  She had no further hemodynamic
instability.

3.  PNEUMOTHORAX:  The patient had a small right pneumothorax
likely secondary to placement of her central venous line.
Chest tube was placed and discontinued after two days.  The
pleural fluid that was drained and analyzed during the
placement of the chest tube showed that the effusion was
transudative.

Once the patient was transferred from the ICU to the floor,
she had an episode of hypoxia which was likely secondary to
reaccumulation of the pleural fluid.  She had a repeat
thoracentesis done for drainage of the fluid and subsequently
had good respiratory function.

4.  DECUBITUS ULCERS:  The patient was found to have
decubitus ulcers on her previous admission.  She continued to
have wet-to-dry dressing changes b.i.d.  The Plastics team
was consulted and recommended continuing the dressing
changes.  The patient was also continued on her antibiotics
with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl for a total of a six
week planned course.

On this admission, there were no clinical signs or symptoms
of bacteremia or sepsis secondary to her decubitus ulcers.

5.  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:  The patient has end-stage multiple
sclerosis and was given supportive care.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
placed on aspiration precautions and tube feeds were advanced
as tolerated.

7.  CODE STATUS:  The patient was full code on admission and
at discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged back to
[**Hospital3 **] Center.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is in good condition,
afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating tube feeds.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration.
2.  Decubitus ulcers.
3.  End-stage multiple sclerosis.
4.  Pneumothorax:  Right-sided pneumothorax resolved.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.
2.  Vancomycin 1 gram q. 24 hours.
3.  Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d.
4.  Vitamin C.
5.  Colace.
6.  Senna.
7.  Subcutaneous heparin.
8.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
9.  Multivitamins.
10. Magnesium sulfate.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] Center where she will continue her
broad spectrum antibiotics for a total of six weeks.  She
should also continue q.d. to b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing
changes for her decubitus ulcers.  The patient should be
placed on aspiration precautions and tube feeds should be
continued.

FOLLOW-UP: The patient should follow-up with her primary care
provider.

Date of Birth:   [**2145-9-28**]     Sex:  F

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
female who was noted to have a flow void on her internal
communicating artery after undergoing an magnetic resonance
imaging for followup of her multiple sclerosis.

She underwent a cerebral angiogram on [**2199-9-13**] for
better visualization of here cerebral vasculature.  At this
time, an 8-mm and a 4.5-mm aneurysm at the internal
communicating artery and left middle cerebral artery
bifurcation were discovered.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis effecting the left leg and the left
arm.
2.  Migraine headaches.
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Increased cholesterol.
5.  Frequent bronchitis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left elbow surgery.
2.  Total abdominal hysterectomy.
3.  Left knee surgery.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to DECADRON, and
TETRACYCLINE, and PENICILLIN, and KEFLEX.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 60-pack-year smoking
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile with normal
vital signs.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  The extraocular muscles were
intact.  Pulmonary examination revealed the lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Her extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
Neurologic examination revealed a woman who was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  Strength in her left upper extremity was [**2-20**]
proximally and distally.  Strength in her left lower
extremity was 0/5 proximally and distally.  The right upper
extremity was [**3-23**] proximally and distally.  The right lower
extremity was [**3-23**] proximally and distally.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2199-9-24**] the
patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and
taken to the operating room where she underwent a craniotomy
and left middle cerebral artery and internal communicating
artery aneurysm clipping by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**].

She was extubated in the operating room and transferred to
the Postanesthesia Care Unit where she continued to recover.
The patient was then transferred to the Neurosurgery
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control and every one
hour neurologic checks.

The patient was monitored overnight in the Neurosurgery
Intensive Care Unit.  She was placed on a Nipride drip to
maintain a systolic blood pressure of less than 140.  On
postoperative day one, her potassium and magnesium were found
to be low and were therefore repleted.  Neurologic
examination postoperatively, revealed the patient was easily
arousable and oriented to person, place, and time.  The face
was symmetric.  She had limited abduction of her right pupil
and was only able to move her right upper extremity against
gravity.  Her grips were full on the right.  Her grip and
deltoid muscles were [**3-23**] on the left.  Her biceps and triceps
were [**1-23**] bilaterally limited by effort.  Her iliopsoas were
[**4-22**] on the right and antigravity on the left.  She had
upgoing toes on the left.

On postoperative day two, the patient was transferred to the
floor.  The Physical Therapy Service and Occupational Therapy
Service were consulted to see the patient.

On postoperative day three, the patient underwent an
angiogram to evaluate the success of her surgery.  The
impression of this angiogram was that her internal
communicating artery and left middle cerebral artery
bifurcation aneurysms were clipped with no evidence of
residual aneurysmal filling.  The patient's post angiogram
check revealed that she was stable.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged on
postoperative day four in stable condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aneurysm of internal communicating artery.
2.  Aneurysm of bifurcation of the left middle cerebral
artery.
3.  Status post craniotomy and clipping of both aneurysms.
4.  Status post follow-up angiogram of the cerebral and
carotid circulation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Percocet by mouth as needed (for pain).
2.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day as needed (for
constipation).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] in one month.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
female with a past medical history of progressive multiple
sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes Type 1, obesity, saddle
pulmonary emboli secondary to deep vein thrombosis,
obstructive sleep apnea.  Over the past month she has been
noticing increasing lower extremity weakness with recurrent
falls as well as increasing shortness of breath.  Due to
recurrent falls she has been using a wheelchair.  Her
multiple sclerosis type is relaxing and remitting and she has
had in the past bilateral optic neuritis requiring multiple
hospitalizations as well as treatment for multiple sclerosis
with Cytoxan, adrenocorticotropic hormone and high dose
steroids.  She has never returned to baseline after her
initial flare at age 31.  Her multiple sclerosis has also
resulted in the loss of gag reflex with increasing difficulty
swallowing and a baseline very hoarse voice although she has
had no documentation of aspiration pneumonia.  Her shortness
of breath is described as progressive and she has significant
dyspnea on even mild exertion.  There is no reported
shortness of breath at rest or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
or orthopnea or chest pain.  She presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2143-12-11**] for a
suspected multiple sclerosis flare due to weakness and falls.
A PICC line was placed and she was treated with a nine day
course of high dose steroids.  [**Hospital1 **] was called for control
of her diabetes on steroids.  Later that day she was felt to
be volume overloaded and in light of her symptomatology she
was started on Aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. p.o.  Pulmonary was
consulted to assess her shortness of breath on [**12-14**] and
electrocardiogram was ordered and read as normal.  The
patient was ruled out for acute myocardial infarction by
cardiac enzymes.  Pulmonary requested pulmonary function
tests which were done and were found to be within normal
limits.  FVC was 90%, FEV 1 of 97%, FEV 1/FVC 108%, total
lung capacity of 91% and DLCO corrected for lung volumes of
80% which were read as low normal.  The MIP of 67% which was
indicative of mild respiratory muscle weakness.  A
computerized tomography scan was ordered to assess for
pulmonary emboli and was read as low probability.  Lower
extremity noninvasive studies were read as negative for deep
vein thrombosis.  Cardiac echocardiogram showed no
significant abnormality and arterial blood gases taken with
readings of 7.37 pH, pCO2 of 36 and pO2 of 73 on room air.
The patient then underwent a chest computerized tomography
scan and was found to have evidence of severe tracheomalacia
with narrowing of the trachea and main stem bronchi to a near
crescent with partial collapse on inspiration.  There was no
evidence of interstitial lung disease.  In addition the
patient was found to have acute renal failure with a rise in
creatinine from a baseline of .8 to 1.0 to a peak recorded
value of 1.6 in the hospitalization on [**2143-12-23**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for multiple sclerosis, diabetes Type 1, obesity,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea
for which she does not use CPAP, saddle pulmonary emboli in
[**2136**] in the setting of hospitalization and deep vein
thrombosis.  The hospitalization was secondary to multiple
sclerosis.  She has had thoracic herpetic eruptions status
post excision of two benign breast masses and numerous basal
cell carcinomas of the face.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin NPH 40 q. AM, 20 q. PM;
Betaseron 1 cc q.o.d.; Pravastatin 20 mg q. PM; Macrodantin
500 mg q. PM; Diazepam 2 mg q.h.s.; Halcion 0.25 mg q.h.s.;
Effexor 112 mg/75 mg; Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s.; Baclofen 40 mg
p.o. q.h.s.; Cardizem CD 300 mg p.o. q.d.; Mirapex 0.27 mg
p.o. q.h.s.; Multivitamins; Fibercon; calcium supplements.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa and Tetracyclines, nature of
reactions is unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a past smoker, she quit many
years ago.  She lives with her husband.  She is on
disability.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She has two other siblings with multiple
sclerosis and there is also significant coronary artery
disease.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had no fevers, no nightsweats, no
chest pain, no weight changes, no heat or cold intolerance,
no headache, no urinary symptoms, no change in bowel habits,
no bright red blood per rectum, no melena, no abdominal pain,
no visual changes and no rashes.  Positive chronic lower
extremity edema.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
orthopnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission 99.8 temperature, blood
pressure 140/80, heartrate in the 90s, respiratory rate 16,
99% on room air, fasting.  Blood sugars were recorded at 120
to 200.  General, she is not in apparent distress, morbidly
obese with hoarse voice.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Respiratory,
clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild upper airway
noises.  Abdomen, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, 2+ lower extremity edema
bilaterally.  Neurological, alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values on transfer to Medicine
revealed white blood cell count of 19.1, hematocrit 30.7,
platelets 224, INR 1.5, sodium 133, potassium 5.4, chloride
106, carbon dioxide 23, BUN 58, creatinine 1.5, glucose 141,
calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.6, phosphate 3.5.  Urinalysis had
100 mg/dl of protein, otherwise clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (By systems)  1.  Multiple sclerosis -
Neurological, the patient was treated with high dose steroids
per routine for multiple sclerosis.  Neurology felt that she
responded well.  She was taken off Prednisone without a taper
and then due to her electrolyte abnormalities there was worry
of adrenal insufficiency and she was put back on Prednisone
on a short taper.  There were no further neurological issues.

2.  Shortness of breath - Initial differential for this
patient's shortness of breath included cardiac, coronary
artery disease, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia or interstitial
lung disease, respiratory muscle weakness.  Tracheomalacia
was found incidentally on computerized tomography scan as
well as a mild respiratory muscle weakness.  As other causes
of shortness of breath and dyspnea were ruled out it is felt
that the patient's shortness of breath is multifactorial
caused by a combination of morbid obesity, tracheomalacia and
respiratory muscle weakness secondary to multiple sclerosis.
The patient's trachea and bronchi were stented open by
Interventional Pulmonology with good effect and no
complications which resulted in a subjective improvement in
this patient's breathing.  She was also counseled and given a
nutrition consult for weight loss which should improve her
breathing as well.  Hopefully also conditioning at
rehabilitation will improve her exercise tolerance.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Over the course of
the hospitalization the patient had a recent drop in sodium
and increase in potassium.  This was most probably secondary
to the patient's starting Aldactone at a relatively high dose
of 25 b.i.d.  The patient's Aldactone was discontinued on
[**12-24**].  There was not significant improvement by the
time of dictation on [**12-26**], however, values remain
stable and the patient was asymptomatic.  It is probable that
she is having residual electrolyte balancing abnormalities
secondary to the acute renal insufficiency complicated by the
residual effects of Aldactone expected to resolve over time.

3.  Acute renal insufficiency - This patient had her Pheno
recorded at 0.6 which is less than 1% which is consistent
with prerenal failure.  The patient was not taking p.o. as
well and was diuresed as well during hospitalization for
thoughts of volume overload as the cause of shortness of
breath.  The patient was given fluids and her creatinine
promptly responded dropping to less than 1.2 by the time of
discharge.

4.  Diabetes - With the help of [**Hospital1 **] attending this
patient's glucose was well controlled throughout the
admission observing no change from her insulin regimen and
this will be followed up as an outpatient.

5.  Cardiac - There was no evidence of substantial cardiac or
coronary artery disease in this patient at this time.

6.  Pulmonary - Emboli, this patient is maintained on
Coumadin with goal INR of 2. to 2.5.  She will be restarted
on Coumadin prior to leaving and bridged with Lovenox at
rehabilitation.

7.  Psyche - Her Effexor was continued.

8.  Endocrine - This patient's thyroid function was assessed
as a possible cause of the patient's dyspnea and contributing
factor and obesity.  TSH was found to be 1.2, within normal
limits.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to rehabilitation
and from there to home with services.

Chief Complaint:
urinary incontinence, fever


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous catheter placement -- [**10-3**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 35 yo M with advanced progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
urinary retention who was hospitalized on [**10-1**] with urinary
retention and discharged without a foley after improving and who
presented again on [**2190-10-3**] with fever, chills, rigors,
worsening left sided upper/lower extremity weakness and 2
episodes of urinary incontinence found to have urinary tract
infection.

Patient was feeling well until 3am on Sunday when he woke up
with weakness in LLE and LUE.  His mother felt that he was very
warm to the touch.  His temp was 102.4.  He had chills and
rigors.  Patient had 2 episodes of urinary incontinence.  Pt's
neurologist was called, and advised pt to present to ED.

In ED, initial vitals were 102.6 110 110/68 20 100% RA.  ECG:
NSR at 95 bpm. Lactate was 1.5. Blood, urine sent for culture.
U/A demonstrated UTI and patient was given Ceftriaxone 2gm and
Tylenol.  CXR did not show pneumonia.  Patient was having little
UOP, foley was placed.  Got 8L NS, put out 650cc urine.  SBP
went to low 90s, RIJ CVL was placed. CVP was [**4-16**].  Got another
2L NS, CVP was then 12, total UOP 700cc. Patient was seen by
neurology in the ER.  They felt that given his current fever,
the weakness is likely an exacerbation of existing MS lesions
and not consistent with a new flare. In addition, in the setting
of his infection he should not receive high-dose steroids as
there would be no indication at this time. Last set of vitals in
the ER were SBP103, HR104, RR18, 97%RA T101.4.

On arrival to the ICU, vitals were T 99.4 HR 103 BP 132/68 RR 21
O2 100% RA.  He denied light headedness, SOB, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, cough.  His mother did not a rash on his
left thigh approximately 1 week ago which she thought might have
been related to his Avonex injection site or a spider bite. It
has since cleared and he has had no other skin manifestations.


Past Medical History:
1. Secondary-progressive MS
2. Visual impairment (bilateral severe optic neuritis) from MS
(denies any other medical history, including steroid-induced
diabetes or HTN)
3. Urinary retention (1st episode 5 years ago)


Social History:
Lives at home with parents. Uses a 4-pronged cane but often a
custom wheelchair at baseline. He is a college graduate and used
to work as an actor in a Shakespearean theater company and owned
an acting company. He is now too disabled to work, and spends
all day at home, ""entertaining my parents."" He is single.  He
exercises a few times per week, doing strength exercises, and
Pilates.  He
denies tobacco, EtOH, illicits.


Family History:
His mother is 65 and his father is 72.  They are healthy.  He
has one brother who is healthy.  There is no history of MS in
the family.  His grandparents all died from coronary artery
disease except for one who died from stomach cancer.

.
EKG-Sinus tachycardia. Short P-R interval. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2190-10-3**] there is no significant change.
.
CXR ([**10-3**]):
IMPRESSION: Increasing interstitial opacities, possibly
secondary to atypical pneumonia given the clinical history.
Bronchovascular crowding from low lung volumes may exaggerate
the findings.
.
[**10-6**] CXR-IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to chest radiographs
since [**2183**], most recently
[**10-3**]:
Hyperinflation due to obstructive airways disease is not as
severe as it has been. Lungs are clear. Small left pleural
effusion is new, probably the
residual of mild edema that was present on [**10-3**] and
subsequently
resolved. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.

Renal US [**10-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Within the limitations of poor visualization of the left
kidney,
unremarkable renal ultrasound with no evidence of perinephric
fluid
collections.
2. Relatively thick-walled bladder is collapsed about a Foley
catheter. This
is a nonspecific finding, though is compatible with the provided
clinical
history of infection.

CT abdomen/pelvis w/ contrast [**10-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of nephrolithiasis.
2. Thick-walled bladder raising the question of cystitis,
however this is
difficult to assess in the context of a foley catheter.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
4. Small amount of free pelvic fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo M with hx of advanced progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
urinary retention who was hospitalized on [**10-1**] with urinary
retention p/w with fever, worsening left sided upper/lower
extremity weakness and 2 episodes of urinary incontinence, found
to have urosepsis.

1) Complicated acute bacterial cystitis complicated by
Urosepsis: On presentation patient had fever, tachycardia, and
leukocytosis that with urinary tract infection suggesting
urosepsis.  After presentation he received 11 units of IVF on
the night of presentation for low urine output and relatively
hypotension (though unclear how far this is from his baseline).
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics that were then
narrowed to ceftriaxone when sensitivities became available.
Concerningly he remained febrile for the first few days of his
hospitalization despite good antibiotic coverage.  ID was
consulted and agreed one blood culture with coag negative staph
was likely a contaminant.  CT and U/S of kidneys showed no
complication of cystitis or stone.  He eventually defervesced,
however, and appeared well.  He completed the seven day course
of antibiotics recommended by ID on [**2190-10-9**] and was discharged
home thereafter. Afebrile on the day of discharge. See below for
discussion on urinary retention. Pt was also advised to have a
repeat ua and cx after discharge.

2) Urinary retention: Patient has had previous episodes of
urinary retention associated with his MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] had a foley placed
on presentation here and then upon it's removal had somewhat
high residual volumes suggesting some degree of retention.
Possibly a consequence of infection and general illness vs
worsening neurological disease.  Given concern that some
persistent retention between first and second hospitalization
led to this infection and family's large concerns about managing
[**Name13 (STitle) **] catheterizations at home he was discharged with a
foley in place and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] urology within the
next week to repeat urodynamic testing and make recommendations
for going forward.  He was also set up with [**Last Name (STitle) 269**] at home to help
manage the indwelling foley.

3)Multiple Sclerosis: Advanced progressive MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] was recently
an inpatient on neurology and received one dose of IV steroids,
but it was then decided he was likely not having an MS flare and
was discharged.  Per Neurology consult team, given his fever the
weakness is likely an exacerbation of existing MS lesions and
not consistent with a new flare. In addition, in the setting of
his infection he should not receive high-dose steroids as there
would be no indication at this time. His last dose of Avonex was
[**9-30**].  Per Neuro recs, pt's weekly Avonex therapy was held
during his stay.

4) Small pleural effusions: Pt had bilateral small pleural
effusions on imaging that were thought likely due to some volume
overload due to vigorous hydration (11 L) in a rather small
individual.  Considered too small to safely tap and given lack
of pulmonary infection symptoms or any lung disease to cause
yield was thought to be low.

5) Nutrition: The patient is very thin and per Neurology
struggles to gain weight.  Nevertheless, albumin was reasonable
at 4.3.  A Nutrition was consulted.  Pt's diet was supplemented
with Ensure.
.
6) Sinus tachycardia: Pt has a history of postural tachycardia
diagnosed on tilt table testing. No signs of hypoperfusion or
dehydration at this time. Would not be concerned about transient
rates in 100s to 130s on position change. PO intake encouraged.
Improved.
.
4) Borderline hypotension: Renal function and UOP good, no
alteration of mental status, and tachycardia appears a
longstanding issue per above description. Pt remained
asymptomatic. BP's ranged 80's-100's during admission. Afebrile
without leukocytosis leading up to day of discharge.

Transitional Issues:
-Pt will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in urology for removal of
his foley, repeat urodynamic studies, and to discuss plan for
further management of retention, of note during this
hospitalization patient's mother was insistent she did not feel
comfortable being the one responsible for catheterizing him
-Pt will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his multiple sclerosis
-He was Full Code

History of Present Illness:
53 year-old woman with a history of secondary progressive MS
with [**First Name3 (LF) **] indwelling foley, recent diagnosis UTI (started
levoflox yesterday) presents with episode concerning for
seizure. Per pt's partner, pt has had increased lethargy for the
last week, just been ""out of it,"" with inattention and some mild
confusion, worse than baseline. Reports this is pt's usual
manifestation of UTI, and says that pt recently diagnosed with
UTI by [**Location (un) 1468**] VNA. No fevers at home. Pt also reports nausea
for last few days. Partner says that things even worse last
night: pt unable to operate electric wheelchair, unable to
maintain trunk posture, increasing difficulty feeding self.

~9AM, partner reports she heard pt making strange noise. Went
into bedroom and pt vocalizing, eyes blinking rapidly, arms
tonically flexed, right side of mouth drooping, head turned to
left, eyes at midline. Lasted approximately 1 min. Afterwards,
pt closed eyes and was unresponsive to voice or sternal rub.
Partner than called 911. Pt reports remembering paramedics in
room, remembers ambulance ride, though she does not remember
episode. Did not take AM meds.

ROS: No fever, chills, cough, cold sx. No CP, SOB. +nausea,
little vomiting. No change in bowel habits (requires
disimpaction
~every other day at baseline). No change in arm strength,
changes
in vision or hearing.
.
In the ED VSS, found to have Na 114, multifactorial but mostly
[**1-15**] poor PO intake, diuretic use. She was treated with ativan 1
mg x 1 in ED. Loaded with dilantin 1 g IV. Also noted to have
repeat seizure before coming to MICU.
.
In the MICU, pt received hypertonic NS, with slow normalization
of her Na and no further sz activity. Given that she no longer
had ICU needs, she was called out to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo W w/MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] UTIs s/p hyponatremia and seizure.

# Hypotonic Hyponatremia: In the setting of poor PO intake and
diuretics. Na deficit on admission estimated to be 780 meq.
Brought up to 126 in 24 hours with 3%NS. Later switched to NS to
avoid too rapid correction. No signs of central pontine
myelinosis and no further seizures once Na corrected. Na was 138
at time of d/c.
.
# Seizures: Secondary to hyponatremia. Seizure in the setting of
Na 114, suggests that sz threshold may have been lowered by
SSRIs and levaquin. In the ED, she was loaded on dilantin;
however, as sz [**1-15**] hyponatremia, Neuro recommended stopping it.
Once her Na had normalized, SSRIs were re-started. Levaquin was
continued throughout her hospital course.
.
# UTI: Pt was diagnosed w/UTI by VNA on the day prior to
admission by and had been started on levaquin. UA here showed
only yeast. While this may represent a colonization, given she
has a [**Month/Day (2) **] indwelling foley, associated pyuria and low-grade
temps prompted treatment with a short course of diflucan 200mg
x3days. She will continue levaquin to complete a full 14d
course.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic with Fe studies c/w ACD. On day of d/c,
pt's HCT was 26.7. She had no si/sx of active bleeding and her
decrease is most likely [**1-15**] volume resuscitation w/resultant
hemodilution.
.
# Hypotension: SBP 80s-100 in MICU. Her baseline SBP is ~100s,
suggesting a component of volume depletion. She had no si/sx
sepsis. In the MICU, she received PRN boluses to keep her SBP in
the 90s-100s range. On the floor, she received continuous IVF
and her SBP remained in the 100s. Diuretics (which she takes for
her dependent edema) were held, but pt was instructed to resume
taking them on d/c.
.
# Positive BC: [**12-17**] BCx grew alpha-hemolytic strep >24 hours
after being drawn in an asymptomatic patient, suggesting a
contaminant. Pt's central line was without tenderness or
erythema. Regardless, it was d/c'ed and tip sent for cx. Two
sets of surveillance cx were drawn and were neg x48 and 24
hours. She had been started on vanco in ICU which was stopped
prior to discharge.
.
# R ischial ulcer: Stage II-III with no undermining. Wound care
followed the patient while in-house and dressing was changed
Q3days.
.
# Anion gap acidosis: On admission pt had an AG attributed to
starvation ketoacidosis, which resolved with fluids/PO intake.
.
# MS: Neuro c/s recommended continuing current regimen of
Baclofen. As pt's Avonex is dosed QFri, she did not miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]n while in-house. She was instructed to continue her
home regimen on d/c and to f/u with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1728**] on the [**5-6**].
.
# Dispo: Pt was d/c'ed home with services once her surveillance
cxs were 48hr neg and her Na was consistently in normal range
with no further seizures. She will f/u with her PCP next week
and with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1728**] in 2 weeks.

Chief Complaint:
Fulminant liver failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-5-15**] orthotopic liver transplant


History of Present Illness:
46 y.o. W with hx of acute hepatitis in [**2134**], which was
attributed at that time to ditropan vs unclear etiology, and
multiple schlerosis, presents from an urgent care visit with her
PCP where she presented with lower extremity edema, nausea,
decreased PO intake for the past 2-3 days, and jaundice.
.
In [**2134**], patient had a complete work-up for hepatic failure
including: hepatitis A, B, C serologies, leptospira,
ceruloplasmin, copper, herpes type I and type II antibodies,
HIV, ascites fluid for culture, blood cultures, and ophtho
consult for Kayser-Fleischer rings, which were all negative. A
CT of the liver as part of a liver transplant work-up showed a
shrunken cirrhotic liver with regenerating nodules with
hyperintense lesions susicious for hepatomas. There was evidence
of ascites and portal hypertension as indicated by dilated
portal vein and recanalization of the periumbilical vein. A
transjugular liver biopsy showed
(1) Confluent a bridging necrosis, submassive necrosis with
collapse in bile ductular proliferation. (2) Lobular chronic
inflammation with necrosis and hepatocellular cholelithiasis.
(3) No fatty changes or viral cytopathic changes seen. (4) Focal
increase in stainable iron seen. (5) Trichrome reticulin in
ursine stains performed. The patient was put on the liver
transplant list and followed by hepatology, but her hepatic
failure slowly resolved over the course of about four months.
.
The patient says she has been in her usual state of health. She
is on disability for her MS but otherwise has no other
significant medical problems. She estimates drinking less than 1
alcoholic beverage per month, and denies any changes in her
routine. No recent changes in medications, travel, sick contacts
except for her six-year-old son who has a cough.
.
In the ED, Hepatology and Transplant Surgery were both
consulted. A RUQ US was performed which showed possible
cirrhosis, no ascites, and a CTA was ordered and is still
pending. Head CT was negative. Hepatitis serologies and many
other labs as detailed below in the A & P were sent. Serum tox
screen was negative. Patient was admitted to MICU for close
monitoring. Of note, when patient was admitted to the unit she
was discovered to have an old tampon in place which had been
there for at least several days.


Past Medical History:
1. Multiple sclerosis diagnosed in [**2133**]. The patient complains
of numbness and weakness in bilateral lower extremities.
2. Episode of fulminant liver failure in [**2134**] with negative
work-up as above.
3. Status post C-section.

Social History:
Tobacco - quit [**9-/2136**]

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the MICU with acute liver failure and
moderate encephalopathy with MELD score of 32 on admission.
Patient now with  but laboratories stable. Unclear etiology.
Patient recently given solumedrol, which has been shown in case
reports to be associated with acute liver failure. CTA showed
cirrhosis, patent vasculature. Lactulose was given for
encephalopathy and w/u for liver failure was done. She was
intubated for respiratory failure from fluid overload and from
inability to manage secretions from encephalopathy.

On [**2142-5-15**] a liver donor was available and she underwent
piggyback liver transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] assisted
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Induction immunosuppression was given
(solumedrol and cellcept). Per operative note, The GDA was
taken. The common hepatic artery was dissected down to an
appropriate spot where it could be clamped. A graybulldog was
placed on the artery. The donor artery was cut to
the appropriate length using a branch patch from the GDA and a
running 6-0 Prolene anastomosis was accomplished.  Please see
operative report for further details. She tolerated the surgery
without complications and was transferred immediately afterward
to the SICU intubated.
On POD 3 she was febrile to 101.5 and Pan-cultured.  Her NGT was
removed on POD 3 and she was extubated.  She tolerated the
extubation well, and was placed on cool Neb's only.  On POD 5
and Insulin drip was started for Blood Sugars of 390.  She was
also started on clears and advanced to a regular diet.  She was
transferred to the floor and her foley was removed on POD 6 and
neurology was consulted regarding management of her MS while she
was in house.  She was A+Ox2 and had persistent RUE weakness.
Her mental status improved and she was A+Ox 3 on discharge.  She
continues to have RUE weakness, but she states this is her
baseline during a ""[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]"".  Neurology recommended an MRI head
+/- spine with contrast (which was done on [**5-27**]), Continue with
PT/OT, and to continue steroids the immunosuppression should
help her new MS [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Her husband to brought in the OSH MRI
for comparison to the MRI on [**5-27**] and the MS lesions were
stable.  She will follow up with her Neurologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 32186**] in
[**Location (un) **], MA.  On POD 8 her Lasix was stopped.  Another
post-operative issue was hoarseness.  She was evaluated by
speech and swallow and aspiration was ruled out. After a video
swallow she was placed on a diet of thin liquids and regular
solids, and Tube Feeds were started to ensure adequate
nutrition.  She was encouraged to take in PO's.  ENT was also
consulted to assess [**Location (un) **] cords.  She was scheduled for a video
Stroboscopy on [**5-29**] which demonstrated Right [**Month/Year (2) **] [**Month/Year (2) **]
paralysis.  She will follow up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatients
regarding treatment of her [**First Name (STitle) **] cords.
On POD 11 her JP drain was removed.  Physical Therapy continued
to work with her and she was placed in Rehab facility per
physical therapy recommensations.  She is being discharged
afebrile, vital signs stable, tolerating her tube feeds, A+Ox3
and at her baseline physical ability.  She will follow up with
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 816**], Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] from ENT, and her neurologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 32186**].

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo F w/ h/o neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy presents w/ fever
and flushing to the ED found to have positive UA and CT was
concerning for pyelonephritis.
.
#Septic Shock/Urinary Tract Infection/Bacteremia - Admission
blood cultures were positive [**3-8**] for gram negative rods. She was
started on Vancomycin and meropenem and agressively volume
resuscitated with NS IVF. A CT abd/pelvis shows hydronephrosis
w/ obstructing stricture and calcification at R ureteral=ileal
anastamosis site. IR placed a nephrostomy tube to relieve the
obstruction. Upon return from IR procedure the pt developed
respiratory distress then respiratory failure requiring
intubation. Following sedation for intubation her blood pressure
decreased and she was sequentially placed on phenylepherine,
norepinepherine and vasopressin. Pressors were weaned within 48
hours. ID was consulted, and recommended changing antibiotics to
ceftazidine. Because she has a cephalosporin allergy, she
underwent ceftaz desensitization on [**12-8**]. ID also recommends
that, once she clinically improved, she should undergo
lithotripsy of large staghorn calculi to prevent further UTI.
The patient will continue with the R nephrostomy tube & IV
ceftazidime until the ureteral obstruction in resolved as an
outpatient.  She was given a follow up appointment with urology
to address this.  A PICC was placed on [**2174-12-13**].  The placement
was confirmed by chest xray.
.
#Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Following IR procedure the pt
developed respiratory failure most likely flash pulmonary edema
in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation. CXR showed
fluffy bilateral infiltrates c/w ARDS. She was initially
ventilated with the ARDSnet settings. Her FiO2 was gradually
weaned down.
.
# Prolonged altered mental status: she remained very sedate and
unalert, even once sedation from mechanical ventilation had been
held for days. An EEG did show slowing consistent with
toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. Delirium improved with
resolution of her critical illness.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: dropped to a low of 17. Thought to be [**1-5**]
sepsis vs autoimmune disease vs drug effect (meropenem). She was
switched to ceftaz per above. She was transfused multiple units
of platelets, as she developed substantial bloody leakage from
her catheter insertion sites. Platelets stable in normal range
on discharge.
.
# Renal failure: she became aneuric in setting of hypotension,
possibly [**1-5**] ATN. Renal was consulted and she was initiated on
HD. Renal function improved and dialysis was discontinued prior
to leaving the MICU.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31440**], it was a pleasure to participate in your care
while you were at [**Hospital1 18**]. You came to the hospital because you
had fevers which were due to an infection in your urinary
system.  This infection was caused by a blockage in your ureter
which prevented your urine from draining normally.  On [**11-30**] you
had a nephrostomy tube placed to relieve the obstruction.  Your
infection caused you to be critically ill with septic shock.
YOu were in the ICU where you needed to be intubated and started
on dialysis.  Fortunately, you improved significantly with these
measures in addition to IV antibiotics.

There is still a calcified stricture/stone in your ureter which
will need to be addressed on an outpatient basis.  Until then,
you will remain on IV antibiotics to prevent further infection.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
- Medications ADDED:
---> Ceftazidime 1 gm Q8H
- Medications STOPPED:
---> Please stop taking magnesium oxide while your kidneys are
recovering

History of Present Illness:
HPI (per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]): Ms. [**Known lastname 28119**] is a 49 year old female s/p OLT
in [**5-/2142**] for
fulminant hepatitis due to unknown etiology c/b post-op biliary
stricture required multiple [**Year (4 digits) **] and stents. Patient was
recently admitted on [**2145-2-19**] for pan colitis and UTI and was
treated with Cipro and Flagyl. Her diarrhea resolved and she was
discharged on [**2145-2-24**] with Bactrim for her UTI. Two to three
days prior to this presentation, patient reported having
effusive diarrhea, almost every 2-3 hrs. She felt weak and
fatigue but denied any fever/chills/nausea/vomiting. She has
been trying to drink more fluid to keep up with her diarrhea but
admitted that she hasn't been doing enough. Patient was
evaluated in the ED, given Cipro/Flagyl and resuscitated with
IVF.

ROS:

negative and liver bx with bridging necrosis but no viral
cytopathic changes or fatty change). Initially, liver function
improved with no specific intervention, but a recurrent episode

of fulminant hepatitis led to OLT in [**2142-5-3**], complicated by
stenosis of the bile duct anastomosis in [**2142-6-3**], which
required stenting.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Tranplant Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment of large volume watery stool.

Neuro: The patient received dilaudid with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization. Supplemental oxygen was weaned gradually to
room air.

GI/GU/FEN: Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Due to large volume
watery stool, stool cultures were sent which were positive for C
Difficile. PO Vancomycin was started empirically with subsequent
gradual decrease in stool output.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Immunology: Tacrolimus was continued and levels monitored daily
with dosing adjustments as needed.

Prophylaxis: Venodyne boots were used during this stay; was
encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.

Disposition: Pt worked extensively with physical therapy with a
plan to continue follow-up at her rehab facility.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.

Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with a past medical history notable for peptic ulcer
disease with a history of ""bleeding ulcer,"" coronary artery
disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and multiple sclerosis, who
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
emergency department early on the morning of admission
complaining of epigastric pain.  The patient stated that,
approximately two weeks prior to presentation, she began
experiencing diarrhea alternating with constipation.  Then,
approximately two days prior to admission, the patient began
having only constipation.  When the patient did have bowel
movements, they were black and tarry.  This was an
unprecedented occurrence for her.  The patient denied having
any recent hematochezia, hemoptysis or hematemesis.

At approximately 2 AM on the morning of admission, the
patient was awakened by epigastric pain which was [**6-10**] in
severity and constant in duration.  The patient could not
describe the quality of pain.  She felt that it was well
localized to her epigastrium, although she admitted that she
also experienced interscapular pain with this episode of
epigastric pain.  She was not surprised by this, as she
reported that she had interscapular pain ""whenever I get
stomachaches--since I was a kid.""  The patient was brought by
EMS to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency
department, where her pain abated completely shortly after
receiving Maalox at approximately 9:30 AM.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Of note, the patient admitted that for
approximately five years her stool had been of smaller
caliber.  She denied any other change in her bowel or bladder
patterns.  She specifically denied fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or headache.  She denied sore throat,
cough, recent change in weight and night sweats.  In terms of
the patient's cardiovascular status, she specifically denied
having had any pain radiating to her left jaw (her anginal
equivalent) since her coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2141**].  She denied chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations,
diaphoresis, lower extremity edema, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and orthopnea.  (Although she used two pillows for
sleeping, she said that she did not become dyspneic without
them.)  The patient denied any recent illnesses, including
changes in her multiple sclerosis.  Similarly, she denied
recent changes in her appetite, diet and medication regimen.
Her fingerstick blood sugars had been consistently running
under 120.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had no history of
known myocardial infarction.  She did have angina (left jaw
pain), which led to cardiac catheterization, which
subsequently led to coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2151**].
The patient had not had any angina since her coronary artery
bypass grafting.
2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection
fraction of 20-25% by echocardiogram in [**2155-10-2**] with
left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation
and mild pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Peptic ulcer disease:  The patient had a history of a
""bleeding ulcer"" in [**2146**] with hematochezia.  Per the patient,
this was an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  No intervention
was required at that time.  No pertinent records were
currently available for this history of bleeding ulcer.  The
patient was on ranitidine.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2:  This was diagnosed
approximately one year prior to admission, per the patient.
This was well controlled on Glyburide with fingersticks
consistently under 120.
5.  Hypertension:  Per the patient, her blood pressure
typically ran in the 120s-130s/80s.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Multiple sclerosis:  This was diagnosed when the patient
was approximately 35 years old.  Per the patient, this had
not affected her vision but rather her lower extremities and
balance, such that she had difficulty walking well.
8.  Spinal stenosis.
9.  Mild dementia.
10. Urinary incontinence, likely functional, as the patient
had trouble getting to the bathroom in time.
11. History of right shoulder pain, status post a fall.
12. Chronic lower back pain, which continued status post
laminectomy in [**2148**].
13. Status post appendectomy in [**2120**].
14. Status post surgery to correct trigeminal neuralgia in
[**2118**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived alone at home in
[**Location (un) **], [**State 350**].  She had two boarders who lived
upstairs in her home.  She would like to move to an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility soon.  The patient denied a tobacco history.
She admitted rare alcohol use, but not abuse.  The patient
denied any other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 97.2??????F, a heart rate of 86, a blood pressure
of 171/86 in the left arm and 181/80 in the right arm,
respirations of 14 per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%
on room air.  In general, the patient was a pleasant
75-year-old woman, awake and in bed, in no acute distress.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation
bilaterally.  The extraocular movements were intact
bilaterally.  The nasal and oral mucosa were clear.  The
mucous membranes were moist.  The neck was supple without
thyromegaly, jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy or
bruits.

The heart had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard
maximally at the apex with a sinus S1 and S2 and no rubs or
gallops.  The chest had mildly decreased breath sounds with
occasional rhonchi at the bases bilaterally.  Otherwise, the
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with a well
healed sternotomy scar.

The abdomen was soft, but mildly tender to palpation,
especially in the left lower quadrant.  The abdomen was
nondistended with positive normal active bowel sounds.  There
was a well healed midline scar, apparently due to exploratory
laparotomy, which eventually led to appendectomy.  The
gastrointestinal evaluation revealed dark stool that was
guaiac positive.  The patient was nasogastrically lavaged in
the emergency department with 250 cc of fluid, revealing no
blood and no bile.

In the extremities, the venous graft harvest site was well
healed at the right lower extremity with no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  On
neurological examination, the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Speech was normal and appropriate.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact bilaterally with the
possible exception of the tongue deviating slightly to the
right.  Strength was [**4-5**] in the upper extremities and lower
extremities proximally and distally bilaterally.  Sensation
was intact to light touch bilaterally at the distal lower and
upper extremities as well as the three divisions of cranial
nerve V.  Rapid alternating movements were intact
bilaterally.  Reflexes were 0 at the lower extremities
bilaterally and 2+ symmetrically at the upper extremities.
The right toe was downgoing and the left toe was equivocal.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Note that the patient was
guaiac positive, but nasogastric lavage negative (as noted
above.)  The CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 10,300,
hematocrit of 30.0 (which upon repeat was 31) and platelet
count of 289,000.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 138, potassium
of 6.0 (which upon repeat was 4.0), chloride of 108,
bicarbonate of 19, BUN of 49, creatinine of 1.3 and glucose
of 121.  Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin time of
12.4, partial thromboplastin time of 25.6 and INR of 1.0.
Liver function tests and pancreatic function tests revealed
an ALT of 33, AST of 52, total bilirubin of 0.2, amylase of
41 and lipase of 21.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled times
three:  CK #1 was 287 with an MB of 6, CK #2 was 177 with an
MB of 4 and a troponin of less than 3 and CK #3 was likewise
negative.

RADIOLOGY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly with no increase in pulmonary vasculature and no
infiltrates or effusions.  There was degenerative joint
disease of the spine.  There was no air under the diaphragm.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram showed an old left
bundle branch block and sinus rhythm with no acute changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  What follows is an outline of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course by problem list.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was admitted
initially to the medicine service and the gastrointestinal
service was consulted.  On [**2155-8-17**], the patient
underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed grade
1 esophagitis at the gastroesophageal junction as well as a
large, cratered, 3 cm ulcer with adherent clot in the
proximal bulb of the duodenum.  A visible vessel suggested
recent bleeding.  BICAP electrocautery was applied
successfully for hemostasis.  Otherwise, the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal to the third part of
the duodenum.

The patient was continued on Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Her
aspirin and Vioxx had been held since admission.
Helicobacter pylori was sent, which eventually came back as
positive.  Late in the evening of [**2155-8-17**], the
patient began to experience hematemesis.  Nasogastric lavage
could not successfully clear the patient and thus she was
transferred to the medical intensive care unit.  The patient
was transfused two units of packed red blood cells and
subsequently underwent embolization by the interventional
radiology team.  Following embolization, the patient
experienced a second mild hematocrit drop and was transfused
an additional two units.  Thereafter, her hematocrit remained
stable.

In terms of the patient's Helicobacter pylori, she was
started on a Prevpac, which she is to continue for two weeks.
Following conclusion of the Prevpac, the patient should be
maintained on Protonix or some other gastrointestinal
prophylaxis and she should not be given non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin, as she has a risk of
re-bleeding.

Other gastrointestinal issues for the patient include the
fact that she has a history of decreased stool caliber for
approximately the past five years.  Thus, she will need a
follow up colonoscopy as an outpatient to evaluate for
possible malignancy.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
a) In terms of the patient's coronary artery disease, she was
ruled out for myocardial infarction.  Her aspirin was
discontinued upon admission because of the risk of
gastrointestinal bleed.  She was continued on Lipitor,
Lopressor and a cardiac diet.

b) In terms of the patient's blood pressure, pump status and
history of congestive heart failure, she was continued on
Lopressor and Lasix.

3.  DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient was maintained on
her outpatient regimen of Glyburide and maintained good
fingerstick blood sugars.

4.  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:  The patient was continued on her
amantadine without any exacerbations of her multiple
sclerosis.

5.  FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Following
embolization, the patient's diet was advanced successfully
and she tolerated it without nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Her electrolytes remained stable.

6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained for a time on
Protonix drip, followed thereafter by her Prevpac which,
after outpatient discharge, is to be followed by other
gastrointestinal prophylaxis per her primary care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient remained stable and
afebrile.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  duodenal ulcer.
2.  History of coronary artery disease.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Multiple sclerosis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on her
above noted outpatient medication regimen with the notable
exceptions of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, which were discontinued due to the risk of re-bleed.
Furthermore, the patient was discharged on Prevpac q.d., of
which she is to finish a two week course.  Following
conclusion of her Prevpac, the patient should be placed on
gastrointestinal prophylaxis such as Protonix or an H2
blocker.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with her primary
care physician within the following week.

CTA [**10-1**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
2. Multifocal confluent airspace opacities, left lung greater
than right. The pattern is similar to [**2133-8-17**], and the
differential diagnosis includes atypical pneumonia, aspiration.
Less likely etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage and drug reaction
are also possibilities.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o woman with h.o MS, asthma, chronic pain who presents with
SOB/cough/ fever s/p fall.
.
# Atypical vs CAP: She presented with dyspnea on [**10-1**]. CT and
CXR of lung showed opacification of the left lung (effusion
vs.collapse), and right lung with patchy airspace opacity. CT
findings of ground glass opacities in both lungs suggested
atypical pneumonia. On [**10-3**], she was started on
Methylprednisolone 60 Q 8 and given lasix 20 IV x 1. Pt
continued to have worsening dyspnea and was intubated on [**10-3**]
until [**10-6**]. Pt's abx was broadened to Zosyn for 5 days and
after extubation, she was placed on Levaquin again by ICU to
finish a 7 day course of abx. ON floor, pt continued to have
productive cough but oxygen requirement is stable at 0 liters
and has remained afebrile. Pt finished levaquin on [**2134-10-10**]. For
ongoing cough, pt is on frequent nebs, guaifenisen, prn
suctioning and also ordered for chest PT.
.
# S/P Fall: She had a fall with no available history for
pre/post symptoms to suggest syncope from vasovagal,
orthostatic, or cardiac cause. Pt remembers the fall and she
denies pre-syncopal/syncopal sx. She thinks she tripped. She has
an L eyelid superficial lac which was steri-stripped in ICU.  CT
head and C spine are negative.

# Altered Mental Status: Pt appeared delerious upon admission.
It was believe that the pt was AOx3 at baseline, however had
been noted to be suffering from hallicinations/paranoia prior to
admission. DDx included infection, narcotic intake (although tox
negative), toxic metabolic. Pt is s/p fall but CT head/neck
negative for acute process. Following extubation on [**10-6**], the
patient's mental status cleared and she was subsequently AOx3 on
the morning of [**10-8**] and has continued to remain oriented and
calm on floor.
.
# advanced MS (multiple sclerosis). Neurology was consulted for
help on medical management, they recommended continuing all her
MS meds but they were inaccurately dosed in ICU. Home meds
reconciled with husband on [**10-9**] and except for soma, pt is on
all of her MS meds again as of [**10-9**].

# Chronic Pain: Per husband, pt is on oxycontin 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen and assessed in the ED by the Urology
service.  Following persistent hypotension to SBP 80s, continued
chills and leukocytosis, the decision was made to place a
ureteral stent given CT findings of obstructive stone.  She had
received iv levofloxacin, ceftriaxone.   The patient was taken
to the OR and underwent cystoscopy and right ureteral stent
placement.  The patient was placed on Ampicillin/Gentamicin both
peri- and post-operatively.  She was taken to the ICU
post-operatively for observation, and did transiently require
use of a cardiac pressor (neo) to maintain SBPs>80.  Over the
course of POD1, she was weaned from pressor dependence and began
to autodiurese.

The remainder of her course was unremarkable.  Her leukocytosis
improved and she remained afebrile for the rest of her
hospitalization.  The Foley catheter was removed and the patient
voided spontaneously.  She had no significant pain complaints.
She was ambulating and tolerating a regular diet.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 56 yo m with progressive multiple sclerosis, neurogenic
bladder with h/o multiple UTI's, h/o upper GIB, who was admitted
to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2140-9-28**] with lethargy and
generalized weakness noted by VNA. He had been previously
admitted to [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) 359**] and d/c'd on [**9-8**] (diagnosis not
listed in d/c summary, although pt's wife reports 5 admissions
in the past 2 months for ""sepsis"" or ""GI bleeding""). On the most
recent admission, he was noted to have a dirty UA and was
treated for UTI. He was initially treated with levoflox. Pt then
had a CXR which showed RLL PNA, with subsequent CXR showing
worsening R sided PNA, so he was changed to azithro and CTX.
Subsequent CXR's showed bibasilar pulm process. ID was
consulted, and Abx were changed to amp/gent, and then back to
levoflox. Pt intermittently required 100%NRB, but then was
weaned down to 50% ventimask. Pt currently has no complaints,
except being ""thirsty"". Currently denies N/V, F/C, diarrhea,
hematemesis, melena, hematochezia (although pt had black stools
in the past prior to GIB diagnosis). Pt was transferred to the

Pertinent Results:
CXR (prelim): R sided peri-hilar fullness and RLL infiltrate, L
sided infiltrate
.
CXR ([**9-28**], OSH): New bihilar infiltrates and more patchy
densities in the periphery of both lungs may represent
asymmetric pulm edema vs bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
.
CXR ([**10-1**], OSH): Again seen is the L sided air space process.
Much of the increased density has shifted from the lower to the
upper lung field. This may represent fluid in the pleural
fissures rather than a parenchymal process. Hoever, PNA cannot
be excluded. The pulmonary vascularity is congested as before,
indicating CHF. The cardiac silhouette is ill-defined, though
likely at least mildly enlarged. Grossly, no left-sided pleural
abnormality is seen.

hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs are clear, with
interval resolution of previously noted opacities. There are no
pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Pleural thickening at the
apices is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of parenchymal opacities.

Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is  normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old male with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with UTI and
worsening multi-focal PNA likely [**12-24**] aspiration.
.
#) PNA: Swallow evaluation determined that the patient may be
aspirating and a FEES was done. The results are as  follws:
""Mr [**Known lastname 25925**] presents overall with a functional oral and pharyngeal
swallow mechanism. He does appear to be limited by his side
lying, semi-reclined position in the bed, as did appear to
contribute to premature spill over and penetration of thin
liquids. However, no aspiration occurred during the exam, and
strategies were effective at eliminating spill over of liquids
prematurely to the pharynx.

The pt did c/o sensation of swallowing excessive air when
drinking. I explained to the pt that since he drinks from a
straw, this would increase the amount of air he swallows with
each sip of liquid. However, we discussed that this is typical
for people who are dependent upon others for feeding, as a
'feeder' cannot judge how much liquid is 'too much' if they are
given sips via a cup. I did discuss that adaptive cups, with
lids
and handles, may allow him to self-feed and avoid the 'sucking'
action which is increasing his air intake.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Regular texture po diet with thin liquids.
2. Po meds may be given whole with liquids. If too difficult to
coordinate given bed positioning, pt may require po meds whole
with purees.
3. Basic aspiration precautions, including:
 a. Position as upright as possible.
 b. Take only sip of liquid at a time. ""

He completed the necessary course of antibiotics on [**2140-10-4**]
(between the previous and  current hospitalization, was treated
with vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin. HE was initially inthe ICU
and required O2 by face mask. An ECHO done at that time to
assess for CHF revealed a normal LVEF but positive for diastolic
dysfunction. He was treated both for pneumonia and CHF (lasix)
with decrease in O2 requirement. He did not need O2 prior to
discharge. NEbs and then inhalers were also given to the
patient.

Neurology was consulted to evaluate if the dyspnea and hypoxia
could be due to exacerbation of MS They did not think that this
was an exacerbation of MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 25926**], no IV steroids were given.
NIF normal. Pulmonary had recommended PFT. These should be done
as out-patient. His recent recovery from CHF and pneumonia may
offset the results of PFT at this time.

# CHF, diastolic: Took lasix as outpatient. ECHO here - normal
LV EF with some evidence of diastolic dysfunction. As noted
above, his dyspnea improved with lasix as well. Repeat chest
xray showed marked improvement.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: Refer to above. Patient and his wife want
to transfer all care to [**Hospital1 18**].
Neuro consult recommended outpatient sleep study, which is
scheduled to assess if he needs a BiPAP.

Baclofen pump does not need refill at this time (this was
confirmed with patient's wife by the ICU staff)
.
#) HTN: pt hypertensive on admission, now normotensive after
being given home BP meds. On lisinopril and norvasc.
.
#) h/o GIB: pt reportedly has erosive esophagitis and gastritis.
 Hematocrit remained at baseline with no acute bleeding.
Carafate and [**Hospital1 **] protonix continued. The results of his prior
workup for GI bleed should be obtained in clinic.

PT cleared him for discharge.

The patient wants to transfer his primary care to [**Hospital1 18**] as well.

History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: Mr.[**Known lastname 25925**] is a 56 M with h/o multiple sclerosis and an upper
GIB who presented to an OSH after an epsiode of BRBPR this
morning. The patient is cared for during the week by a PCA who
noted approximately 1 cup of BRBPR after a BM and in the shower
the AM of admission. The PCA also noted that his stool was
normal color and that the patient appeared pale and somnolent.
At home, the patient's blood pressure was 71/42, then 79/47
after drinking Gatorade. At the OSH, the patient was hypotensive
in the 70s and had a Hct of 24 for which he received 2U of PRBCs
and 3L IVF. He underwent NGL at the OSH, which was negative. He
was started on omeprazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Also of
note, he was intermittently hypoglycemic at OSH but here his
glucose is 133. In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable with a
repeat Hct of 35, he was found to have UTI and was hypothermic
with a rectal temperature of 92. He was started on levofloxacin.
The patient has never had a colonoscopy, but had a sigmoidoscopy
in [**7-27**] after an episode of BRBPR and found to have hemorrhoids.
Of note, the patient was discharged on [**10-9**] after ICU
hospitalization for PNA which was treated with a course of
vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, hypothermia, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] is a 56-year-old male with progressive MS who has had
multiple admissions in last year for ?sepsis, pneumonia and UTI
(has had suprapubic catheter in place since [**1-25**]) who presented
on [**2140-11-2**] with questionable mental status changes, hypothermia
and hypotension in setting of overnarcotization.
.
Per wife, had [**Name2 (NI) 15618**] baclofen pump 6 days prior to
admission, then downtitrated again 4 days prior to admission,
after which patient appeared somewhat sleepy, but without acute
changes. One night prior to admission, wife reportedly took a
fentanyl patch off of patient and placed a new one.  On the day
of admission, SBP at home was initially in the 130s, but then
after bathing and numerous activities with home health aide
became hypotensive to 80s.  EMS was activated and patient was
brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation.  Per wife,
no fever, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting
occurred (PCP notes that wife has noted the patient
intermittently hypotensive at home, but no log brought in here.
Per patient, wife checks his blood pressure at home three times
each day).
.
After being brought to [**Location (un) **], patient continued to remain with
SBP in 80s w/ drop as low as to 50s. He responded to 4 liters
NS, and was given levofloxacin 500mg once.  Two fentanyl patches
were found on his body - the first at the outside hospital, and
then a second patch removed upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per patient and family
secondary to wanting care here. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CT of head was
negative for intracranial bleed. He received 3 more liters  of
normal saline, as well as vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
clindamycin.  Pt rewarmed passively to over 35 (family reports
pt typically 91-[**Age over 90 **]F). In addition, was given narcan with
apparent good effect on blood pressure.  Blood cultures and
urine cultures were drawn.
.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**2140-11-2**].  CXR showed diffuse
worsening pulmonary edema and an opacity in the left lung base
that could be confluent edema or an early focus of infection.
Patient was started on vancomycin because of concern for MRSA.
.
Patient was transferred from CCU in hemodynamically stable
condition to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 on [**2140-11-3**].  Upon transfer, patient was
experiencing sharp pain in his lower extremities bilaterally
from his hips to his toes, ""the usual pain"".  He was unable to
move his lower extremities or his hands, but claims that this
too is normal (from MS).  He denied trouble breathing, abdominal
pain, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
or palpitations.

Past Medical History:
1) Progressive multiple sclerosis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25923**] [**Name (STitle) 25924**])

Per patient, diagnosed with MS in [**2119**].  Went on disability in
the end of [**2127**].  Wheelchair-bound.  Symptoms are worse in warm
temperatures, so he tries to keep his room as cool as possible.
.
2) Multiple admissions for hypothermia and ?sepsis
.
3) h/o upper GIB (ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis secondary
to NSAIDS)
.
4) h/o LGIB (Colonoscopy in [**9-26**] revealed internal hemorrhoids
and polyp)
.
5) History of pneumonia
Most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-10-19**] with a final
diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia
.
6) Neurogenic bladder
S/p placement of suprapubic catheter.  Managed with oxybutynin
(antispasmodic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]) 5mg PO qday.  Multiple UTIs, last one
[**2140-10-17**] with enterobacter and proteus susceptible to meropenem
and ciprofloxacin.
.
8) GERD
Likely secondary to ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis
secondary to NSAIDS
.
9) Hypertension
.
10) CHF (EF >65% [**2140-10-3**])
.
11) Left eye blindness

Social History:
He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.  He has
three children and three grandchildren. He was a professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25931**] engineering at [**University/College 25932**], but

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) [**2140-11-2**]
Diffuse worsening pulmonary edema. The opacity in the left lung
base may be confluent edema although a focus for early infection
cannot be excluded. Repeat radiography following appropriate
diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
.
HEAD CT [**2140-11-2**]:
Comparison is made with a prior head CT dated [**2140-10-19**].
The evaluation is somewhat limited due to patient motion.  There
is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
effect.  No shift of normally midline structure is noted.  Note
is made of mucosal thickening in ethmoid sinus.  The osseous
structure is unremarkable. Impression: Somewhat limited study,
without evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Micro: C. diff negative, Blood cultures negative, urine culture
10-100K yeast.

Brief Hospital Course:
BP INSTABILITY: Initial hypotension likely due to
overnarcotization in the setting of multiple blood pressure
medications.  Patient responded well to IV fluids and narcan,
and hypotension resolved by [**2140-11-3**].  Amlodipine and Lisinopril
were held in the setting of hypotension; IV lasix was given.
Patient's blood pressures were elevated to 200/100 and pulse to
110 on [**2140-11-4**], and it was felt that autonomic dysfunction from
MS could be contributing to blood pressure lability.  After
consult with neurology, clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] was started on
[**2140-11-4**], and patient's home Lasix (40mg PO qday) was resumed.
The patient responded well.  Lisinopril was re-started at 15mg.
He BP should be maintained between 100-150/60-100 ideally,
though any abnormal blood pressure readings should be repeated
and he should be assessed clinically.
.
UTI/NEUROGENIC BLADDER: Patient has had suprapubic catheter
since [**2140-1-20**] due to neurogenic bladder; has had a history of
UTIs since then.  Urine culture from most recent UTI ([**2140-10-17**])
grew out enterobacter and proteus both sensitive to meropenem,
which was begun on [**2140-11-2**] to treat probable UTI given UA
results with WBC >50 and moderate bacteria.  Because
enterobacter and proteus from [**10-17**] infection were also
susceptible to ciprofloxacin, IV meropenem was d/c'd on [**2140-11-4**]
and PO ciprofloxacin started for a total of seven days of
antibiotics.  He completed his course without incident.  His
oxybutynin was continued.  Urology was consulted for suprapubic
catheter replacement.  Urology did not feel it absolutely
necessary to have the catheter replaced.  We could not obtain
the right catheter to replace the older one, and was deferred to
the outpatient setting.  The patient's wife replaces his
catheter at home, and will do so upon discharge.
.
MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: Likely due to overnarcotization,
hemodynamic instability, resolving UTI, and pain.  Fentanyl
patch was restarted on [**2140-11-4**] to help with pain control; other
narcotics were held.  UTI and hemodynamic instability were
addressed as described above.  His neurontin was also held.  His
mental status returned to baseline.  He was discharged on his
fentanyl patch.  His neurontin can be re-started at his
neurologists/PCP discretion though his pain was well controlled
without it at discharge.  Oral narcotics should be avoided.
.
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: Baclofen pump was retained; narcotics and
gabapentin held in the setting of overnarcotization and
hypotension.  Fentanyl patch was restarted on [**2140-11-4**] and
Vicodin 1-2 tabs q4-6 hours as needed for pain.  His vicodin was
stopped due to mental status changes which resolved.
Re-starting his neurontin can be addressed as an outpatient.
Evaluated by OT, recommended relief cushion for support, pain
relief.
.
DEPRESSION: Paroxetine was continued.
.
ANEMIA: Stable throughout admission.  His [**Hospital1 **] PPI was continued
.
CODE: FULL for this admission

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old man
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit after four left anterior
descending artery stents were placed for an acute
anterolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The patient has a history of hypertension and a family
history of coronary artery disease.  No known history of
personal coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, or
diabetes mellitus.

He was washing his bus today when he noted the onset of
severe left-sided chest pain (like ""knives""), diaphoresis,
and nausea.  He was taken by Emergency Medical Service to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Location (un) **] where an acute
anterolateral myocardial infarction was noted on the
electrocardiogram.  He received aspirin, nitroglycerin,
heparin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for percutaneous coronary intervention.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient had an
Angio-Jet of a complete mid left anterior descending artery
lesion and four stents placed.  He was briefly hypotensive
during the procedure and was given dopamine until an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  He was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit stable off of dopamine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Multiple sclerosis (Symptoms include dysarthria and left
leg weakness worse with exertion.  The patient has just
completed a 6-month regimen of chemotherapy and steroids;
alternating months).
3.  Possible nephrotic syndrome (lower extremity edema,
protein in urine).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
lisinopril b.i.d., tizanidine, Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
albuterol, and famotidine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location **] with his wife and four
children.  He drives a [**Hospital1 **] bus.  He has no history of
smoking or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history positive for coronary artery
disease; his sister was deceased at the age of 58, status
post coronary artery bypass graft times three.  His mother
had coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination upon
admission revealed vital signs were stable and unremarkable.
He had no carotid bruits.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm with soft heart sounds.  His abdomen was benign.  His
right groin catheter site was soft and without hematomas or
bruits.  He had dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally.
His neurologic examination revealed alert and mentating well
with dysarthria.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 14.6,
hematocrit was 37, platelets were 263.  INR was 1.3, PTT was
98.2.  Sodium was 139, potassium was 4,  chloride was 103,
bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 25, creatinine
was 0.8, and blood glucose was 133.  Calcium was 9.6.  His
first creatine kinase was 300.  His blood gas was
7.41/38/302.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram prior to
catheterization demonstrated a sinus rhythm at the rate of
88, normal axis and normal intervals.  ST elevations in I,
aVL, V2 through V5.  ST depressions in III and aVF.

Catheterization results with pressures which revealed right
atrial pressure mean of 9 mmHg, pulmonary artery was 42/21,
right ventricular was 50/5.  Arteries revealed left anterior
descending artery with diffuse 30% proximal lesion, 100% mid
lesion, 90% origin first diagonal lesion.  The left
circumflex with diffuse 30% ostial/proximal 40% mid, 70% left
posterior descending artery.  The right coronary artery with
mild luminal irregularities.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronaries:  As above, the
patient had 2-vessel coronary artery disease and had four
stents placed in his left anterior descending artery.  He was
enrolled in the Cool-MI trial.

The patient was treated with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor,
captopril, and metoprolol status post myocardial infarction.
His peak creatine kinase was 7436 with a MB fraction of 830.
The creatine kinases after this trended downward.  After his
intervention, the patient did not have any evidence of
ischemia by symptoms or by electrocardiogram.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was maintained on an intra-aortic
balloon pump for one day following his percutaneous coronary
intervention.  The balloon pump was weaned without event.

He had an echocardiogram on day three status post myocardial
infarction which revealed an left ventricular ejection
fraction of 25% to 30%, with severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction; comprising septal, anterior, and apical
akinesis.  The patient was placed on heparin for this
akinesis; which was converted to warfarin prior to discharge.

(c)  Rhythm:  The patient had multiple runs of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia after his myocardial infarction.  The
longest run consisted of 15 beats to 20 beats and occurred
within 48 hours of his infarction.  He had several shorter
runs of 5 beats to 10 beats occurring more than two days
status post myocardial infarction.

The Electrophysiology Service was consulted regarding
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.  They
elected to see the patient in one month when his course of
Plavix was completed and he was at less of a risk of
bleeding.  He was to have a T wave alternans study at this
time and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of the
Electrophysiology Service.

2.  PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient oxygenated well throughout
his admission and did not have pulmonary problems.

3.  RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient's creatinine remained stable
at a level under 1 throughout his admission.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a drop in his hematocrit
from 37 to 31.4 after his catheterization.  His hematocrit
remained stable around 30 to 31 after that initial drop, and
he did not receive any blood transfusions.

5.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was noted to have multiple
fasting blood sugars of greater than 126 during this
admission.  He had a hemoglobin A1c that was in the upper
limits of normal range.  He was to follow up with his primary
care physician for further diagnosis and management of
possible type 2 diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post left anterior descending artery stents.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Metoprolol-XL 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (times one month).
7.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

IMAGING:
[**11-1**] MRI T spine: Increased signal in the distal spinal cord
indicating cord edema. Subtle irregularity suspicious for flow
voids on the surface of the cord and this finding could indicate
arteriovenous fistula or AVM. No intrinsic hemorrhage is seen
within the spinal cord. Further evaluation with gadolinium
enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine is recommended. Findings were
conveyed to the neurology resident taking care of the patient at
the time of interpretation of this study.

[**11-1**] MRI L spine: Mild multilevel degenerative changes without
spinal stenosis or disc herniation. There are no MRI findings to
explain patient's lower extremity paralysis. Please also see the
thoracic spine MRI of the same day for further evaluation.

[**11-1**] Abd US: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

[**11-1**] MRI T spine w/contrast: The increased signal in the distal
spinal cord is confirmed on T2 axial images. However, no
evidence of abnormal vascular enhancement seen along the surface
of the cord or to suggest arteriovenous malformation. MRA of the
spine or spinal angiogram would help for further assessment as
clinically indicated.

[**11-2**] CXR: no cardiopulmonary process

[**11-2**] MRI Head w/&w/o contrast: Multiple T2 signal white matter
abnormalities, some of which enhance. These findings may be the
same process that is occurring within the distal thoracic spinal
cord described on the [**2104-11-1**] examination. The differential
includes an inflammatory versus an infectious process. This
could include a demyelinating process such as multiple
sclerosis, or an infectious process such as Lyme disease.
Vasculitis is also a consideration.

[**11-4**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect.  Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**11-4**] Chest CT w/contrast:
1.  No evidence of sarcoidosis.
2.  Incidental finding of pulmonary embolus involving the left
lower branch of the pulmonary artery and left lower lobe
segmental branches.  There is Also thrombus in the right upper
lobe branch of the pulmonary artery.
3.  Calcification of the aortic valve as described above.
4.  Gallstone.

[**11-4**] C spine w/contrast: Extensive changes of cervical
spondylosis seen, most significantly at C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7
levels resulting in exit neural foraminal stenosis.
Superimposed left paracentral and foraminal herniation is
identified at C6-C7 level encroaching over the left exiting C7
nerve root.  No cord compression is seen.

[**11-5**] Bilateral LENIs: 1.  Acute to subacute deep venous
thrombosis from the proximal left superficial femoral vein
extending into the left popliteal vein.
2.  Acute thrombus within the right peroneal vein.

[**11-12**] MRA T spine: FINDINGS:  The study reveals the distal
aspect of the anterior spinal artery extending from
approximately the mid thoracic region to the level of the conus
tip.  The fact that the vessel is visible is not necessarily of
pathologic consequence.  Nevertheless, if there remains clinical
suspicion for a spinal vascular malformation, this test is not
to be construed as the optimum examination to exclude this type
of pathology.  For this purpose, conventional catheter spinal
angiography is the definitive diagnostic modality.  There are no
other vascular abnormalities identified.
CONCLUSION:  Visibility of the distal aspect of the anterior
spinal artery, a finding of dubious pathological significance.
See above report.

[**11-17**] MRI Head w/&w/o contrast: Resolution of the previously
seen areas of enhancement along the cerebral white matter since
the previous exam of [**2104-11-2**].  The findings raise the
suggestion of an inflammatory condition such as demyelinating
disease.  Other infectious etiologies cannot be totally excluded
and were discussed on the prior MRI report.  No
abnormal-enhancing lesions are seen on the current exam.  There
are several scattered T2-hyperintense lesions within the
cerebral white matter in a similar distribution to the previous
exam.  Further followup is suggested based on clinical grounds.

[**12-2**] Visual evoked potentials: After stimulation of either eye
there
were evoked potential peaks recorded. The peak after left eye
stimulation was 113 ms, near the upper limit of normal for this
laboratory (114 ms). The peak after right eye stimulation
occurred at
118 ms and was a very broad peak. Though the difference is
relatively
small, the peak after rightsided stimulation is delayed and
suggests a
defect in the optic conducting system anterior to the chiasm on
the
right.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, patient is a 66 year-old male with remote history of
back injury, coronary artery disease, asthma who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with bilateral leg weakness and backache. Exam
progressed over day of admission to point of flaccid paraplegia
with ~T8 sensory level. Initial differential diagnosis included
infectious versus inflammatory disease like multiple sclerosis
versus post infectious process like acute disseminated
encephalomyelisits versus vascular cause like dural
arteriovenous malformation.

1. Neurology:  Patient had MRI spine with gadolinium which
showed evidence of spinal cord edema in the nlower thoracic
cord. There was no inflammation in the cervical cord.
Additionally, MRI of the brain showed multiple T2 signal
abnormalities in the subcortical white matter as well as within
the right frontal lobe. Three of these areas enhanced with the
administration of gadolinium, specifically within the right
pons, within the right frontal lobe adjacent to the anterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle, and within the left frontal lobe
within the corona radiata. Lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis
with 32 WBC (differential 89L 12M), elevated protein 82 and
glucose 75.  Patient initially recieved 2 days of Decadron which
was then discontinued given WBCs in CSF until cultures were
negative. He was then placed on IV Solumedrol 1g QD. Please see
below for infectious workup. In terms of the inflammatory work
up, serum ACE level [**11-7**] was negative and serum protein was low.
SPEP/UPEP were negative, less suggestive of an neoplasm
producing paraproteins.  Flow cytometry of CSF did not identify
a monotypic B-cell population; however, most lymphocytes in the
specimen are represented by CD4 positive T-cells. Cytology  was
negative for malignant cells and there were no CSF peptides. On
[**11-8**], patient was started on mannitol 50mg q6 for cord edema
with minimal effect and was weaned off by [**11-12**].  An MRI/MRA
spine to evaluate for dural AVM was negative. Initial multiple
sclerosis profile and NMO antibody for neuromyelitis
optica/Devics were both negative. CSF had no oligoclonal bands.
Patient was unable to receive IVIG given coagulopathy or
plasmapheresis given his cardiac issues (EF 30%). After
receiving a full 2 week course of IV steroids, on [**11-22**], patient
was switched from IV Solumedrol to Prednisone 60mg [**11-22**].
Tizanidine 4 TID and Neurontin 600 QID were added for
neuropathic abdominal pain and doses titrated to pain control.
Visual evoked potentials ultimately showed evidence conduction
delay and suggest a defect in the optic conducting system
anterior to the chiasm on the right. This makes it most likely
that his underlying diagnosis is multiple sclerosis or an MS
variant. To exclude other possible inflammatory diseases which
may have altered long term therapy, he underwent biopsy of his
right frontal lesion on Tuesday [**11-25**]. Final patholgy was still
pending at time of discharge but preliminary results just showed
gliotic and reactive changes. Sadly, he did not improve with
standard treatment with high dose steroids and remains with a
flaccid paralysis of the lower extremties and T8 sensory level.
He will be followed in the general neurology and MS clinics as
an outpatient.
.
Please note: the sutures from his right frontal biopsy site
should be removed on [**2104-12-5**].
.
2. ID: Differential diagnosis included viral infection including
HTLV-1 which causes spastic paraparesis. CSF studies were
negative for HSV 1 and 2, EBV, HTLV-1, CMV, TB PCR and VZV.
Crytococcal antigen was negative. Oligoclonal bands and IgG
index were unrevealing. CSF bacterial, viral and fungal cultures
were negative. In the serum, testing for HIV, HBV, HCV, VZV,
CMV, HTLV, HSV, EBV were all negative. RPR was non-reactive.
Serum crytococcal antigen was negative. Serum antibodies for
Lyme and toxoplasmosis were negative. SPEP and UPEP were
unrevealing. PPD was placed [**11-3**] and was negative. Urine viral
cx prelim no growth.
.
Of note, patient had a urinary tract infection on [**11-21**]
associated with foley and completed a 7 day course of
Ciprofloxacin (last 2 days on Ceftazidime).  Pansensitive
Pseudamonas aeruginosa grew from urine culture. Foley was
discontinued and patient was instructed on how to
self-catheterize approximately every 6 hours but was unable to
do so due to prostatism and lack of sensation. He will remain
with indwelling foley, but suprapubic catheterization should be
considered in the future.

On [**11-26**], patient was presistently tachycardic and hyptotensive.
He was given stress dose steroids and started on broad spectrum
antibiotics (ceftazidime, vancomycin) given concern for
developing pneumonia (+productive cough and bronchitis seen on
last CXR). Ultimately, he stabilized simply with volume
resuscitation and cultures were negative. He is on a slow oral
steroid taper given his previous issues with blood pressure.
.
3. Hematology: He was found to have a large DVT and asymptomatic
pulmonary embolus. This was likely due to immobility and statis.
Anti Phospholipid screen negative. He was started on warfarin
after bridging with heparin. Goal INR is 2.0-3.0. Ultimately, we
decided not to proceed with plasmapheresis or IVIG for treatment
of his inflammatory spinal cord disease given risk of heart
failure with the former and hypercoagulability with the latter
with questionable benefit. Had IVC filter placed under IR on
[**11-24**].
.
4. Cardiovascular: Echocardiogram showed no PFO, ASD, or VSD. He
has an ejection fraction of 30%. Has been relatively hypotensive
at times, but asymptomatic with systolic blood pressure in low
100s.
.
5. GI: Given his paraplegia and spinal cord inflammation,
constipation has been an issue. He will need to be maintained on
an aggressive bowel regimen to prevent obstruction or impaction.
He responds well to daily Lactulose and prn Golytely.
.
6. Social: Social work was consulted as patient lives alone and
is estranged from family. Has relatives in [**Location (un) 686**]. Getting
OOB to wheelchair. While a patient here, social work and
physician filled out paperwork to initiate getting handicap
accessible housing for the patient. He will need extensive
social supports in place in order to transfer from rehab to
independent or assistive living.

History of Present Illness:
57 year old male with suspected multiple sclerosis and recently
diagnosed severe mitral regurgitiation in [**State 108**] who preseted
with complaints of dyspnea. He recently moved to [**State 108**], when
he developed acute onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and body aches.
On [**5-16**] he went to an outside hospital, and he was found to have
a pneumonia and a new holosystolic murmur. He was admitted for
further work up. He was treated w/ antibiotics (azithromax,
ceftriaxone). Per review of OSH records TTE showed severe
prolapse of the MV posterior leaflet with severe MR, which was
confirmed by TEE that showed ruptured chordae and flailing of
the posterior leaflet. He also had a BAL that showed usual
respiratory flora, was negative for malignancy and negative for
acid fast organisms. Cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, and
pulmonary were consulted. He declined further intervention and
wanted to have further work up in [**Location (un) 86**]. He left [**State 108**] and
returned to [**Location 86**]. Throughout this time he continued to have
shortness of breath. He he is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for surgical evaluation of mitral valve.

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Torn mitral chordae are present. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 3D views show a flail
P2, with an anteriorly directed jet. There is no pericardial
effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. There is a mitral ring
with no leak and no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] = 4 mmHg. No AI. Aorta
intact.

[**2107-6-19**] CXR: The patient is status post sternotomy, with sternal
wires and clips and a prosthetic valve. There is mild
cardiomegaly. The aorta is slightly unfolded. There is upper
zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is a small left
effusion and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
with mild-to-moderate bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2107-6-14**] with severe mitral
regurgitation and critical stenosis in the left anterior
descending coronary artery. He was taken to the operating room
on [**6-14**] where he underwent mitral valve repair and coronary
artery bypass grafting x 1. Please see operative note for
details. Immediately post-operatively he was transferred to the
CVICU intubated and sedated on propofol and Phenylephrine. Later
this day he awoke neurologically intact and was weaned and
extubated. Neo was weaned off and he was started on beta
blockers, statin and Lasix. On post-op day one he was
transferred to the step down unit for ongoing post-operative
care. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
experienced post-op atrial fibrillation and was treated with
increased beta blockers and amiodarone and converted to sinus
rhythm. He was transfused 2 units PRBC for post-operative anemia
(HCT 22.8, at discharge 28.9). He was evaluated by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning and a brief rehab stay was
recommended prior to his return home. He redeveloped atrial
fibrillation and was started on Coumadin. At time of discharge
he was in rate controlled atrial fibrillation and will need
titration of his Coumadin for a goal INR 2-2.5 (currently 1.1).
On post-op day 7 he was discharged to rehab ([**Location (un) 15852**] at Rye, NY)
with the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a 65yo F with a PMH of DMII, obesity, HTN, MS,
and hypothyroidism presenting with a 1 week history of fatigue/
SOB found to be in heart block. Hospital course by problem is as
follows:
.
#) Heart block: Patient was found to be in high degree heart
block, likely multilevel in nature based on EKG findings. The
patient was monitored on telemetry, with nodal blocking agents
held (home nifedipine) until an EP study was performed on [**6-15**].
On [**6-15**] a DDD pacemaker was placed without complication and the
patient continued to do well throughout the remainder of her
hospital course.
Etiology of heart block was most likely age/idiopathic; however,
lyme titers were checked and found to be negative. Free
thyroxine was WNL.
.
#) Chest pain:  No history of CAD per patient report; she has
had a prior cath without intervention and reports a ""negative""
stress test within the past 5 years. Cardiac enzymes were
negative x 2, and ischemia was ruled out as etiology of chest
pain/ SOB.
On [**6-17**] the patient experienced a 10 minute episode of
anginal-type pain (substernal heaviness/ pressure radiating down
both arms reaching [**7-23**] before subsiding on its own). VS were
stable and EKG, while showing V pacing, did not show any
significant EKG changes. Upon further questioning the patient
recalls having similar experiences at home over the past few
months.
Throughout the admission the patient was maintained on home
doses of ASA and lipitor.
.
#) ?UTI: The patient has an indwelling catheter due to MS and is
on chronic macrobid therapy. Evidence of bacteria on UA was
therefore treated with home dose of macrobid.
.
#) DM:  oral antidiabetic meds were held, including metformin
and the patient was maintained on an ISS.
.
#) Hypothyroidism: free thyroxine level was WNL; the patient was
maintained on her home dose of levoxyl.
.
#)The patient had a cardiac, diabetic diet and was maintained on
a bowel regimen, heparin subQ, and a PPI while in house. She was
discharged to rehab because PT evaluation indicated that she was
functioning below her baseline and she could use further PT to
aid in her transfering given mobility restrictions in left arm

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a
67-year-old man with the past medical history significant for
advanced multiple sclerosis, who underwent an endoscopic
resection of the esophageal polyp on [**2196-2-19**] by
Dr. ....................  The indication was for high grade
dysplasia /Barrett's esophagus.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was actually discharged the same day.  The
patient returned home to [**Hospital3 **].  The following morning, he
woke up and had substernal chest pain, sharp in nature
without radiation, no nausea or vomiting, no fevers or
chills.  He went to his local [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for
evaluation.  There, he was started on a cardiac workup, but
the chest x-ray revealed pneumomediastinum/widened
mediastinum.  The patient received IV Ampicillin, Gentamicin,
and Flagyl.  He also received an IV steroid bolus and he had
a NG tube placed by direct vision.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History is significant for hypertension.
2.  Multiple sclerosis since [**2173**].
3.  Osteoporosis.
4.  Depression.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease/Barrett's esophagus
status post endoscopic resection of polyp.
6.  Obesity.
7.  Status post excision of a pilonidal cyst.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 15 mg p.o.q.d
2.  Detrol 4 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Prozac 20 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Cylert 75 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Fosamax 10 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.q.d
7.  Baclofen 100 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Methotrexate 2.5 three times weekly.
9.  Avonex 1 mg one time a week.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not drink any alcohol.  He
does not smoke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, the patient's physical
examination was significant for a temperature of 100.1, pulse
93, blood pressure 127/109.  He was alert, oriented.  He was
in no acute distress.  He had decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  He was also slightly tachypneic with no crepitus.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachycardia, but with a regular rate, normal
S1 and S2 normal.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no rebound or
guarding.  He had a fascia defect approximately 2 cm at the
umbilicus, with no incarceration.  Groin was notable for no
hernia.  RECTAL:  Examination was guaiac negative, no masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Examination was notable for peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the following:
White count at the outside hospital was 15, hematocrit 45,
platelet count 150,000.  Electrolytes:  Within normal limits.
LFTs were also within normal limits.  Chest x-ray:
Significant for widening of the mediastinum.  EKG:  ST
changes, but not significant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the ICU for close
monitoring given his pneumomediastinum, most likely secondary
to perforation during his endoscopic procedure.  At that
point, it was unclear if he perforation was contained.  He
underwent a CAT scan with oral and IV contract, which
revealed that there was no extravasation of contrast from the
esophagus into the mediastinum.

The patient was made NPO with NG tube suction, given IV
fluids and IV Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Flagyl.  The
patient was closely monitored in the ICU setting.

On SICU day #3, the patient's condition was felt to be stable
and he was transferred to the floor.  At this point, he was
kept NPO with the NG tube to suction.  A thoracic
consultation by Dr. .................... was obtained.  It
was his opinion that the patient undergo a barium swallow to
again re-evaluate his esophageal perforation.  Therefore, on
hospital day #5, the patient underwent a barium swallow,
which revealed no extravasation of barium from the esophagus.
 At this point, the patient's NG tube was discontinued,
although he was kept NPO overnight.  TPN was continued and,
therefore, on the next morning, hospital day #6, he was
advanced to clears.  The patient tolerated the clears and on
hospital day #7, the patient was advanced to regular diet.
He was tolerating a regular diet, therefore, the TPN and
central line were discontinued.  The antibiotics were changed
from IV Ampicillin, Gentamycin, and Flagyl to p.o. Augmentin.
 Of note:  The patient's hypertensive medication was
increased from Lopressor 50 q.d. to 50 b.i.d.  Of note:
Given the patient's advanced multiple sclerosis, he has a
chronic suprapubic catheter in place.  The Urology Service
was consulted and on [**2196-2-26**] the patient's catheter was
changed given that he was admitted when he was due to see his
urologist in [**Hospital3 **] to have it changed.  The patient was
discharged home on [**2196-2-26**].  His personal care attendant
was notified and will be seeing him at home to help him with
activities of daily living.

Service:  NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
woman who presented to [**Hospital1 69**]
for difficulty speaking.  She has past medical history of
a-fib, hypertension, status post MI, prior stroke and most
significantly, a 10 year history of inflammatory brain
disease which has not been convincingly diagnosed.  She
presents with a two day course of progressive slurred speech
and difficulty speaking.  She was apparently in her usual
state of health until two days prior to admission when her
husband noted that her speech was slurred.  She called her
primary care physician and over the next day her speech
slurring continued and she became hoarse.  She also had
trouble eating.  She was on her way from [**State 760**] to
[**State 350**] and her husband noted she was unable to speak
at all.  She seemed to be able to understand what was said to
her, but she could not utter any words.  She was also unable
to eat or drink and food would simply sit in her mouth.  She
has been followed very closely by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who has
seen her in the past for a long history of diffuse white
matter disease since [**2170**].  This has been carrying a
diagnosis of MS [**First Name (Titles) 23318**] [**Last Name (Titles) 41306**] disease [**Last Name (Titles) 23318**] unknown.
She was then sent to the emergency room for evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs were normal,
temperature 98.9, blood pressure 208/65.  Neck was supple.
CV regular rate and rhythm.  Pulmonary was clear bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft, nontender.  On neurologic exam, in general,
she was alert, but unable to answer questions.  She seemed to
try to talk, but only occasional soft nonsense words were
able to be uttered.  Comprehension for multiple step commands
was intact.  She could not read, write or repeat.  She was
mildly apraxic and made object substitutions.  Her affect was
somewhat blunted.  Cranial nerves pupils were post surgical.
Extraocular movements were full without nystagmus.  Face was
symmetric.  Sensation was intact.  Corneals were intact.
Shoulder shrug was normal.  Tongue did not protrude and was
able to only wiggle side-to-side.  Strength exam had mild
left sided drift.  Left deltoid was 4+/5.  Hip flexors were
4+/5.  The remainder of her strength exam was [**4-16**]+ bilateral
upper and lower extremities.  Sensory exam was limited due to
language difficulty, however, she did withdraw to pain
bilaterally.  Gait was narrow based and normal with some
slight left sided limp.  Finger-nose-finger coordination was
intact.  Reflexes were somewhat brisk in the upper
extremities, normal in the lower extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the hospital for
further workup.  She had an MRI from [**2180-4-12**] which showed
multiple white matter lesions in the entire brain and brain
stem.  There was also a large right occipital lesion.  MRI
showed multiple distal stenoses of vessels.  Repeat MRI on
admission from [**2180-11-26**] with and without contrast showed a
left frontoparietal area of white matter edema with
enhancement that does not have the characteristic appearance
of an infarct and suspicious for neoplasm.  We discussed
these findings at length with the entire neuroradiology,
neurosurgery and neurology teams and it was felt at this time
she should undergo a biopsy.  Differential diagnosis at that
point included glioma [**Month/Day/Year 23318**] lymphoma [**Month/Day/Year 23318**] inflammatory
process.  We discussed with the family that biopsy would
yield hopefully a definitive diagnosis for this patient.  She
has been treated with steroid courses numerous times in the
past as she has had similar episodes of aphasia and similar
symptoms, in general, and all of these have been well served
with steroids.  However, due to the fact that this lesion was
somewhat different in appearance on MRI, we needed to rule
out the possibility of malignancy.

Patient had an LP prior to biopsy.  Opening pressure was 25,
white cells 4, red cells 0, polys 72, lymphs 16, monos 12,
protein 57, glucose 50.  On [**11-28**] she had an episode of
facial twitching.  Chin and mouth were twitching more on the
left side than the right.  Ativan 1 mg was given and she
seemed to do better.  She was loaded with fosphenytoin and
then started on Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.  An EEG was done
somewhat later in the hospital admission after she was more
stable.  This EEG showed abnormal EEG due to the slow
background with additional bursts of generalized slowing
which suggested dysfunction of deep midline structures as can
be seen with moderate to midline encephalopathy.  There was
also additional left temporal slowing with sharp and spike
and wave discharges over the left frontoparietal region and
this indicated focal cortical or subcortical dysfunction and
could be related to epileptogenesis.  There were no
electrographic seizures noted during the trace.  Thus, we
decided to continue her on Dilantin.

Patient had MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 41307**] done on [**11-28**].  The
results of this exam were inconclusive.  It was at this point
when we decided to go ahead with the biopsy.  Biopsy was
performed on [**12-1**] without complications.  She had some
difficulty with increased blood pressure and we needed to
increase metoprolol and ramipril.  She was also started on
hydralazine at that time and her blood pressure continued to
come down well.  After the biopsy was finished, we started an
IV steroid course of 1000 mg q.day of Solu-Medrol.  This was
continued for five days and then she was tapered down with
p.o. steroids starting at 60.  Throughout the time of the IV
steroids she continued to slowly improve with her speaking.
She was able to talk more.  She was able to follow commands
more.  She was much less apraxic.  She was followed by speech
and swallow on a very close basis.  After being fed by NG
tube for a week, she was cleared by speech to have a full
liquid diet with nectar thickening.  She is to have speech
and swallow evaluations as an outpatient in rehab and she
needs a video swallow within one week to further assess her
swallowing and aspiration risk.

Two days prior to discharge she was doing well.  However, she
had an episode in the morning where she was on the toilet and
it looked like she had a vasovagal syncope event.  Blood
pressure at the time was 80/40 and she lost consciousness for
a few seconds.  She went back to bed and was doing well, but
noticed that she was having bright red blood per rectum a few
milliliters.  This persisted to approximately 50 cc of bright
red blood.  At that time we checked stat blood work and
consulted GI.  They decided to prep her for colonoscopy on
the next day and decided to watch her hematocrit very closely
q.12 hours.  Her hematocrit always remained stable.  She did
have some mild abdominal pain.  However, the next morning she
received a colonoscopy by GI.  This showed erythema,
congestion and exudate and friability in the sigmoid colon
compatible with ischemic colitis.  We then ordered a stat CT
scan of the abdomen with contrast.  This showed localized
wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding of the sigmoid
colon with the appearance of diverticulosis.  The
inflammatory findings were most consistent with
diverticulitis.  However, as direct visualization with
colonoscopy suggested ischemic colitis, CT appearance overall
was in keeping with that diagnosis as well.  These findings
were discussed with GI and we continued her on q.12 hour
hematocrit checks which continued to be stable.  Her most
recent hematocrit was 29.9 with MCV of 61.  At that point we
sent off iron studies which are pending at this time.

We continued to maintain adequate hydration and are still
waiting for final biopsy results from the sigmoidoscopy.  She
is to have a complete colonoscopy as an outpatient in six
months and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic
within this time, telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1954**].  We will
continue the steroid taper as an outpatient as directed
below.  She will also need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
in neurology clinic in the next three to four weeks.

three days, 20 mg times two days, 10 mg times two days, 5 mg
times two days and stop.

Diet is full liquids nectar thick.  Will need speech
evaluation at rehab as well as video swallow within a week.
She also needs physical therapy and occupational therapy as
needed.  She needs to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
neurology clinic in the next three to four weeks.  She needs
to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) **] within the next five to six months for
full colonoscopy.

The final biopsy report is pending at this time.  However,
preliminary report shows acute inflammatory demyelination
with geographic areas of myelin containing macrophages with
partially preserved actins and intensely reactive astrocytes.
 She also had extensive perivascular and intraparenchymal
infiltration by T-lymphocytes with scattered atypical forms,
mitoses and increased proliferation.  The differential
diagnosis for this pattern of demyelination includes multiple
sclerosis/acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis as well as
treated B-cell lymphoma, atypical infection especially viral
infection, vasculitis and T-cell lymphoma.  While multiple
sclerosis is most likely clinically, given this patient's
long history of inflammatory brain lesion, the other
etiologies cannot be excluded.  These were the preliminary
results at this time.

Chief Complaint:
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in patient with recurrent falls
secondary to primary progressive MS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture
G-tube
Intubation/extubation


History of Present Illness:
59 yo man with MS initially admitted with left basal ganglia
hemorrhage, then developed hemorrhage on the right side with
persistent encephalopathy, now with elevated wbc count and
bilateral obturator muscle abscess who is being transferred to
the medicine service from the MICU for overnight monitoring for
hypotension/tachycardia and concern for sepsis.
.
Hospital course:
Initially admitted on [**2117-4-15**] with recurrent falls and found to
have bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages.  Prior to the
admission he had been feeling unwell for 3-4 days with increase
in baseline cough, increased urinary frequency, and dysuria,
worsening lower extremity weakness, and falls while attempting
transfer from wheelchair to bed.
.
He has had persistent encephalopathy (of multifactorial
etiology, pna/uti/nite-day cycle reversal. He was tx for a LLL
infiltrate (MRSA PNA) and finished a 10 day course of linezolid
(vanco allergy), levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed
aspiration pneumonia). On [**5-17**] he was transferred to the MICU for
hypotension and an elevated wbc count (21). The fever workup was
most notable for an abdominal CT which revealed a fluid
collection in the bilateral obturator muscles, for which he
underwent an IR guided biopsy on [**5-26**].  He was initially treated
for this with levo/flagyl.  This was switched to linezolid and
zosyn  but he developed a rash and eosinophilia and was switched
back to levo/flagyl on [**5-21**].
.
He was continuing to remain stable with an unclear etiology for
the obturator abscesses, when on [**6-2**] he became hypotensive to
the 80's systolic and sinus tachycardia to the 130's-140's. His
labs that day were also notable for an increase in the WBC from
10 to 23. He was given 2 L NS on the floor, with an improvement
of his BP to 98 systolic and persistent tachycardia to 120's. He
was then transferred to the MICU for monitoring. In the MICU,
his abx were broadened to po Vanc (to cover for cdiff),
Aztreonam, Linezolid (given h/o MRSA PNA), and levo/flagyl. He
received 5.5 L total of NS in the MICU with his BP now stable in
the 110's systolic. He continues to have asymptomatic sinus
tachycardia into the 110's-120's.
.
Currently patient is unable to answer any questions as he is
lethargic, though arousable.

CHEST, UPRIGHT AP VIEW: Comparison is made to [**2113-10-24**]. The
heart size is normal. The aortic contour is unchanged. The lungs
are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. There
is prominence of the soft tissues of the lower neck.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a small oval hyperdensity seen
within the left putamen with surrounding lucency likely
indicating intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
There is no shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. There is no evidence of
blood within the ventricles or elsewhere within the parenchyma.

The paranasal sinuses are well aerated. No fractures are seen.

IMPRESSION: Small ovoid hyperdensity in the left putamen with
surrounding lucency, likely representing intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema. No mass effect or other areas
of hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus.

Recent outside films with similar findings were reviewed with
neurology team.

[**6-9**] - CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are
bilateral fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the
obturator internus muscles bilaterally. Allowing for slight
differences in contrast phase from the prior CT, these appear
unchanged in size and in overall appearance. The medial width of
the right collection is 1 cm, and the posterior width of the
collections are approximately 1 cm respectively. There is no gas
within the collections and no destruction of the adjacent
osseous structures to suggest osteomyelitis. Mildly prominent
prostate again noted. Foley catheter in a nondistended bladder.
The rectum and visualized distal large bowel is normal.

IMPRESSION: Stable size and appearance of fluid collections,
likely abscesses, tracking under the obturator internus muscles
bilaterally.

[**6-2**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is again seen within
the bladder lumen. Prostate, seminal vesicles appear
unremarkable. The descending sigmoid colon and the rectum are
again seen to be distended with air and stool. No pathologic
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no
free fluid within the pelvis.

Again seen are the fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia
of the obturator internus muscle bilaterally. These do not
appear significantly changed since the prior study. The largest
posterior to the right acetabulum appears to measure
approximately 3.4 x 1.2 cm. No foci of air are seen within these
collections. There is no evidence of adjacent bone destruction
to suggest osteomyelitis.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to the bilateral fluid collections
adjacent to the obturator internus muscles.

[**5-25**] - CT OF THE PELVIS: IMPRESSION:
1) Bilateral peripherally enhancing fluid collections, likely
abscesses, tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator internus
muscles as described above. The left-sided collection was
previously present but is slightly more prominent. The
right-sided collection is new.
2) Small hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver likely a
simple cyst but too small to characterize.
3) Bibasilar atelectasis and small bullae at the right lung
base.
4) Extensive stool throughout the rectum and colon.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 y/o male with history of multiple sclerosis,
initially admitted to the neurology service when found to have
bilateral basal gangila hemorrhages, and then transferred to the
medicine service when found to have persistent fevers and
subsequently bilateral obturator abscesses of unknown etiology.
.
# ID - While in-house developed fever and leukocytosis; CT torso
oddly demonstrated collection at L obturator internus muscle;
attempt at US-guided aspiration of this area was unsuccessful on
[**5-14**]. Empiric therapy with cipro/flagyl helped WBC and fevers
somewhat; interval reimaging 5 days later demonstrated
collection that was a few mm smaller. Antibiotics were held in
an attempt to obtain optimal cultures&#8212;at which time he
developed hypotension and spent a few days in ICU though did not
require pressors. Empiric therapy was reinitiated with
linezolid/zosyn (vanc allergic). T remained 98-99s but he had
persistent WBC 18-21, with eosinophilia as high as 20%, so was
placed on levo/flagyl in case beta-lactam sensitivity was
contributing. He developed marked skin erythema of the lower
extremities with skin peeling and large, tense blisters of the
feet.  Derm followed and felt this was due to antibiotics (more
specifically, the Zosyn already discontinued).  It wasn't
certain that this OI collection is the source of his fever/WBC,
though other w/u had been otherwise unrevealing. There are a few
little chest lesions though not enough to explain leukocytosis.
PPD in-house was negative.  On [**5-25**], pt underwent repeat CT scn
of the Pelvis which revealed bilateral peripherally enhancing
fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the obturator
internus muscle bilaterally, tracking from its origin anteriorly
along the surface of the obturator membrane to its insertion
posteriorly along the medial surface of the greater trochanter
of the femur. Both collections were thin in width and difficult
to accurately measure but are approximately 1 cm in maximum
diameter, though thinner in majority of the other portions. On
[**5-26**], he underwent CT guided drainage of the right abscess which
yielded 10cc of blood and pus sent to the lab for cultures. The
abscess culture grew out Bacteroides fragilis. The patient was
continued on levo/flagyl with improvement in fevers and
leukocytosis. However, on [**6-3**], the patient suddenly developed
hypotension and leukocytosis (10 to 24), requiring transfer to
ICU for goal-directed therapy, including fluids and broad
spectrum antibiotcs of levo/flagyl/linezolid/po vanc (tolerated
well)/aztreonam. He did not require pressors and stayed in the
ICU only for a night. Cx at that time demonstrated a dirty u/a,
with pseudomonas in the urine only sensitive to Tobramycin. The
patient was started on Tobramycin and all abx except levo/flagyl
were peeled off. He responded to the antibiotics with stable
vital signs, defervescene, and resolution of the leukocytosis.
Repeat CT scans on [**6-2**] and [**6-9**] show decreased size of the
bilateral abscesses. The patient finished his course of
Tobramycin for the UTI on [**2117-6-11**] (7-day course). He continues
to be on IV levo/flagyl for the OI abscesses with an open-end
duration at this time, as etiology is unclear and it is
uncertain how these abscesses will respond over time to abx. The
patient is scheduled to have repeat imaging on [**6-25**] of the OI
abscesses and scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4334**] in [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**7-8**], who at that time will determine the duration of the
antibiotics. He needs weekly CBC, Chem 10, LFTs, ESR, and CRP
checked while at rehab and results to be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4334**] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
.
# Intracranial hemorrhage - Head CT performed at [**Hospital1 18**] was
consistent with a left basal ganglia bleed.  On initial
neurological exam, mental status exam was notable for
inattention. Cranial nerve exam notable for right sided skew,
abduction paresis, and facial palsy. Lower extremity exam with
paraparesis, worsened from last reported exam by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The
etiology of the bleed was initially unknown.  MRI was performed
and although limited by motion artifact, revealed no evidence of
underlying mass.  After transfer to the MICU (see below), he was
called back out to the floor on the internal medicine service.
There, he initially did well, but had an episode of decreased
responsiveness which prompted a repeat CT of the head.  This
revealed a new right basal ganglia hemorrhage.  He was
subsequently transferred to the neurology service. After this
event, it was noted that the patient's blood pressures were in
the 170-180's systolic.  This was felt to be the most likely
etiology behind the bilateral basal ganglia intracranial
hemorrhages.  Just to be sure, a stroke consult was called.
They agreed that the bleeds were most likely hypertensive.
However, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and
ruled out cardiac valvular vegetations as a source of embolus.
In addition, a CT venogram of the head was performed and ruled
out venous sinus thrombosis as a cause.  The pt's blood pressure
was subsequently well-controlled with metoprolol. The patient's
mental status has remained stable during his course, notable for
intermittent delirium. His neurologic exam also has remained
stable. His blood pressures have remained stable off of
antihypertensives, which were discontinued due to his
hypotension during sepsis episodes. If his pressures increase
again, he should be restarted on an antihypertensive to keep
SBP<140. He is scheduled to his neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], for
follow-up on [**2117-6-25**].
.
# Hypercalcemia - Patient was noted to have hypercalcemia while
in-house with serum Ca in the high 10's-low 11's. Patient was
asymptomatic. PTH, vitamin D levels, and 24-hour urine were all
consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism - elevated PTH,
elevated serum Ca, normal vitamin D levels, and urine Ca>300.
Endocrine was consulted in-house for recommendations for
management. They recommended IVF and increasing free H20 boluses
in TF, which was done. The patient, as he is asymptomatic and
stable serum calcium for over a month, should follow with an
outpatient endocrinologist by calling the number included in the
paperwork in the next 1-2 weeks. He needs to have a PTH and
calcium checked on [**2117-6-14**].
.
#. Encephalopathy/MRSA pneumonia - On the floor, he remained
agitated and encephalopathic, with poor attention that worsened
at night and improved substantially during the day.  He often
required restraints at night.  The initial workup was negative
for toxic-metabolic or infectious etiologies.  UA and CXR as
well as blood cultures failed to demonstrate any infection that
could have precipitated encephalopathy. At admission, he had an
elevated CPK as well as BUN/Creatinine - for this early
rhabdomyolysis, he was treated with IVF and this improved. The
patient was transferred to MICU, however, after found to have
hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia
and possible mucus plugging.  He was intubated temporarily and a
couple of days after intubation, he was extubated without
difficulty.  For presumed aspiration pneumonia, he was treated
with 10 day course of flagyl and levofloxacin. His sputum
returned positive for MRSA for which vancomycin was started on
[**4-23**]. However, due to papulomacular, blanching rash which
developed after vancomycin, vancomycin was discontinued on [**4-28**]
and started on linezolid, which was continued for a 10 day
course.  For left basal ganglial hemorrhage and mental status
changes, the patient underwent IR guided LP which was negative
for HSV and negative CSF cx for meningitis.  The patient was
briefly on acyclovir and ampicillin to empirically cover HSV and
listeria until cx and HSV pcr came back negative.  The patient
failed speech and swallow on [**4-26**] and NGT was placed for
nutritional support.  The patient was intermittently hypotensive
in the unit thought to be secondary to infection and responded
well to IVF boluses.  Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with a
negative cosyntropin stimulation test. He continued to remain
encephalopathic. Abdominal CT demonstrated possible left
obturator internus muscle abscess, but attempted drainage by IR
could not aspirate fluid.  Nevertheless, he was empirically
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The pt's mental status
gradually but slowly improved over the course of the hospital
stay, though he continues to remain delirious intermittently and
requiring wrist restraints. He has failed repeat speech/swallow
studies and needs to be NPO. He can get a video swallow for
further evaluation at rehab if needed.
.
#. Anemia/Guaiac positive stool: The patient does have guaiac
postive stools and Hct dropped to 19 at one point in the MICU
thought to be secondary to fluids, requiring 2 units of PRBCs,
however, no urgent scope was felt necessary and CT of abdomen
did not reveal any hematoma.  Iron studies were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease. His hematocrit eventually stabilized
once on the floor.
.
#. Hypertension: As above, the pt was found to be hypertensive
after his second intracranial hemorrhage. His blood pressure was
eventually well-controlled with metoprolol. As above, his
anti-hypertensives were d/c'd when his sepsis occured with
hypotension. His pressures have stabilized off the
anti-hypertensives, and he does not require them currently. If
he becomes hypertensive again, these meds can be restarted for a
goal of SBP<140.
.
# Sinus tachycardia - patient has been in sinus tachycardia into
the 110's for the last few weeks of his course, of unclear
etiology. A CT was negative for PE, EKG negative for ischemic
changes. Patient was rehydrated with IVF and treated
appropriately for his infections. Unlikely this is secondary to
infection as he is afebrile and on antibiotics.
.

ventricular hypertrophy
with repolarization changes. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2176-9-17**] atrial
premature beats are present and the axis is less leftward.

AP CHEST 4:20 A.M. ON [**9-27**]

HISTORY: GI bleed following intubation and right subclavian line

repositioning.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-26**] at 5:15 a.m.:

Lung volumes are low and mild pulmonary edema has worsened.
Perihilar
opacification on the right could be asymmetric edema or
developing pneumonia.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements. No
pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. Heart size normal.

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH

CLINICAL DETAILS: Post repositioning of right subclavian line.

FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube at the precarinal level. The
inferior tip of the
right subclavian line lies at the inferior level of the SVC.
Minor kink noted
at its cutaneous entry.

Increased opacity at the left costophrenic angle likely due to a
small pleural
effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED on presentation pt was tachcardic at 118, had an O2
sat of 93% on RA up to 98%on 6L, and vomited 500cc of blood with
clots, the decision was made to intubate the patient for airway
protection, 2 liters of NS and 3 Units PRBCs were given while
waiting for an Abd CT scan in the ED her pressure dropped to low
80s/40s, nursing decided to transport pt to MICU, bypassing CT
scan, MICU team and GI met pt in MICU pts BP measure at
140s/80s, Right subclavian was placed, GI performed gastric
lavage and scoped pt in MICU. Discovered bleeding esophageal
varices in the lower [**1-1**] of the esophagus and banded x 4 as well
as non-bleeding gastric varices in the cardia.
.
In the MICU, pt was extubated on [**2176-9-28**].  She began to develop
a non-productive cough.  She denies any recent bleeding. She
denies any nausea/vomiting/diarrhea.  No chest pain/tightness.
No lightheadedness.  No fever/chills.  She states she feels
comfortable
ROS:  + non-productive cough

1) Upper GI Bleed/Esophageal Varicies: Unknown cause, ?
secondary due history of Autoimmune hepatitis, GI evaluated and
banded times 4. She received 5 days of octreotide and Hct was
stable since banding. US shows normal flow in hepatic and portal
veins and no ascites.
- Continue protonix 40 mg PO BID
- Levoflox 500 mg PO QD x 8d for SBP prophylaxis on discharge
- Nadolol 20 mg PO QD
- will see GI in 1-2wks/endoscope 4-5wks
.
2)BP
Pt initially hypotensive most likely due to hypovolemia but
normalized after fluid resuccitation.  On transfer from the MICU
to the floor, she was slightly hypertensive with SBP in the
140s.  According to her family, she has no history of
hypertension and was on no hypertensive meds at home.  We will
leave her on nadolol and have her follow up with her PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Nadolol 20 mg PO QD
.
3)Respiratory distress: On admission, she was intubated for
airway protection, also ? lung infiltrate: ? bloody aspirate vs.
PNA.  She was started on levofloxacin/flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia.  On the floor, she was afebrile and her WBC count was
normalized on discharge to 5.5.
- continue levo/flagyl day for 8 more days on discharge for
total of 11 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP w/ removal of CBD stent and sphincterotomy
intubation for hypoxia and ICU admission


History of Present Illness:
72 yo male with multiple sclerosis on chronic steroids admitted
for elective CBD stent removal [**2191-2-2**], developed mild bleeding
post-sphincerotomy and now had episode of hypotension (sbp 70s)
in the setting of a 7 point hct drop (although his hct may have
been slightly hemoconcentrated on admission).  Initially
presented [**11-13**] with ascending cholangitis that required abx and
CBD stent placement.  He has been doing well since that
admission.  His hct in [**11-13**] was in low 30s, however, today was
37.2 prior to procedure.  During the ERCP he had an episode of
desaturation to 70s.  His old stent was removed, he underwent a
sphincterotomy and placement of a new stent.  He received
flumazenil and naloxone after he became hypoxic.  His oxygen
sats have been normal since then on 2liters NC.
At 3:30am he developed acute onset sbp in 70s and ST to 140s
that responded to a few hundred cc of IVFs.  He had an og lavage
that showed cherry cola colored fluid that did not clear after
1200cc.  After OGT removed, had 100cc emesis.  Concern was for
upper gi bleed and airway protection so he was transferred to
the ICU for closer monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo male with hx of MS, ascending cholangitis, s/p
cholecystectomy, COPD and RUL resection for benign mass who
presented for outpatient elective removal of CBD stent
complicated by hypoxia and bleeding after sphincterotomy.

Hypotension/GI bleed - Hypotension was secondary to significant
GI bleed. Pt received 10 units pRBCs, 3 units FFP, and IVF for a
total of 13L fluid resuscitation.  GI performed EGD which showed
old blood but no active bleeding site.  He had been started on
stress dose steroids on floor given chronic steroid use and
probable baseline adrenal insufficiency. This was continued
initially but once stable, was quickly tapered to home dose.  He
then received IV lasix for diuresis given volume load during
resucitation.  His Hct remained stable, and he did not require
any further transfusions - the source of his GI bleed remained
unclear.

Tachycardia/afib - Pt with episode of atrial fibrillation on
telemetry on [**2-6**]. Initially unclear if it was tachycardia
causing hypotension or vice versa. However, he had 5L UOP for
the day, looked dry on exam, and so he was given IVF first with
immediate improvement of BP to 110s/70s, HR slowed initially to
110s-130s, then converted to sinus rhythm after an addition
500cc bolus. This was most likely caused by hypovolemia. He was
hydrated and lytes were repleted, and he remained in sinus
rhythm.  Continued treatment for underlying infection as below.

Ventilatory support - Pt was intubated given hypotension and
respiratory distress.  He received fluid resuscitation as
described above and once stable, was extubated after SBT and
rsbi of 30.  Unclear cause of hypoxia although hypervolemia due
to fluid resuscitation was on the differential. Pt was breathing
comfortably on RA at time of discharge.

PNA - Pt with likely pneumonia given RUL opacity on exam. Sputum
grew pseudomonas; pt clinically stable.  He was given empiric
treatment with vanco and zosyn for 7 days, with subsequent
decrease in sputum production and resolution of leukocytosis.

Biliary stent - LFT's stabilized. Not thought to have biliary
source for sepsis. Will need repeat ERCP at some point as
outpatient for removal of stent. Tolerating PO at time of
discharge.

COPD - On inhalers while intubated and changed over to nebs
after extubation.  Held albuterol given tachycardia.  He was
also given steroids for MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal insufficiency.

thrombocytopenia - DIC labs wnl, concern for HIT so avoided all
heparin products. HIT ab was sent which was found to be
negative.

MS - Pt is bedbound given acute illness. He was given a steroid
taper and arranged for outpatient services.

PPx - He was given PPI, bowel regimen, and pneumoboots for
prophylaxis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 56 year old female with advanced multiple sclerosis
admitted for pneumonia.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation related
to her underlying PNA.  She also developed lobar collapse versus
segmental atelectasis on imaging when she was initially weaned
to pressure support.  Sedation was weaned off but extubation was
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] due to weakened gag reflex, underlying muscle
weakness secondary to advanced multiple sclerosis, volume
overload, copious oral secretions, and lack of cuff leak.  She
received a course of dexamethasone given her absence of cuff
leak.  Further diuresis was attempted but was limited by the
patient developing hypotension.  She was extubated on [**4-28**] after
a 4 day trial of PSV.  After exutbation, she still had a high
oxygen requirement and need for frequent suctioning of oral
secretions. Her saturation would improve with repositioning,
chest PT, and suctioning which suggested that she may have had
intermittent mucous plugging.  She also had some pleural
effusions on imaging.  The patient confirmed that she would not
want to be re-intubated and her code status was changed to
DNR/DNI.  She required aggressive chest PT, scopolamine patches
as needed to reduce oral secretions, as well as ipratropium,
albuterol, Mucomyst, and fluticasone MDIs to improve her
pulmonary status.  An insufflator/exsufflator was also initiated
to stimulate cough to further help to bring up secretions.  She
was also continued on her home biPAP of [**9-23**] at night.  Her
fluticasone MDI was discontinued prior to discharge given the
association of steroids with increased incidence of pneumonia.
She may benefit from intermittent scopolamine patches to help
decrease her oral secretions.

2. PNA:  Most likely community acquired with an aspiration
component given her altered gag reflex and observation in the ED
of tube feeds in her mouth.  She was orginally on levofloxacin,
ceftiaxone, and flagyl.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued [**4-23**].
Flagyl was changed to clindamycin to cover for celllulitis as
detailed below.  She completed a 7 days course of levofloxacin
and was continued clindamycin to treat both her cellulitis and
aspiration.

3. Leukocytosis/Fevers:  The patient developed leukocytosis on
[**4-29**] in addition to some low-grade fevers.  She has had no other
localizing sources of infection other than her PNA and improving
cellulitis.  Her fevers may possibly be due to atelectasis, but
C. diff was also ruled out given the administration of
antibiotics.  Her PICC was placed on [**4-24**].  She has not had any
fevers for a few days prior to discharge and her leukocytosis
has also resolved.

4. RLE Erythema:  She was noted to have a rash on [**4-25**] which was
concerning for cellulitis.  Flagyl was changed to clindamycin on
[**4-25**] with improvement of the demarcated border of erythema.  She
completed a 7 day course of clindamycin on [**5-2**].  Clindamycin
was picked because it will cover both possible MRSA and
aspiration PNA.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The etiology is likely secondary to
pneumonia. Her CHADS score is 1.  She was started on diltiazem
30mg PO q6 which worked well for rate control initially but had
to be discontinued given her hypotension.  She was on metoprolol
at home as well which was also discontinued due to hypotension.
Aspirin was originally held given OP bleeding but was restarted
on [**4-25**].  Her home Coumadin was not restarted. She was in sinus
with tachycardia in low 100s and hemodynamically stable at time
of discharge.

6. Multiple Sclerosis: She was continued on her home regimen of
clonazepam, baclofen, and reglan.  It was noted that she had
some increased sedation which improved with halving her
clonzepam dose to 0.25mg TID.

7. Elevated LFTs: Her transaminitis was likely related to her
statin.  It resolved off of simvastatin and her statin was not
re-initiated on discharge.

8. h/o DVT: Her home Coumadin and aspirin were initially stopped
secondary to oropharyngeal bleeding noted on admission.  She was
restarted on aspirin but not Coumadin.  DVT prophylaxis was
maintained with heparin SC and pneumoboots.

9. Depression: She was continued on her home dose of fluoxetine.

10. Hyperglycemia: She did not have a diagnosis of diabetes
prior to admission.  It may be that her sugars have been
elevated in the setting of acute illness.  She was maintained on
a Humalog ISS, but it was discontinued on discharge as she has
not had any appreciable insulin requirement in several days.

10. Code: Confirmed DNR/DNI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 37083**] is a 66-year-old man
with a history of multiple sclerosis, deep venous thromboses
status post inferior vena cava filter, and hypertension, who
was without any past cardiac history, who initially
complained of substernal chest pain at his rehabilitation
facility on the day of admission.  The patient was given
three sublingual nitroglycerins and presented to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room, where an
electrocardiogram was taken and demonstrated [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in Leads II, III, AVF and V3 through V6.  His
blood pressure was in the 80s/50s, and his electrocardiogram
changes persisted.

Therefore, the patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory emergently.  Cardiac
catheterization results indicated a left main coronary artery
without disease, a left anterior descending artery with a 99%
stenosis and thrombus.  The left circumflex artery had a 95%
distal stenosis.  The right coronary artery had a 90%
mid-right coronary artery lesion.  The left anterior
descending and left circumflex lesions were successfully
stented, however, the procedure was complicated by several
factors:
1.  The patient required defibrillation x 2 for an episode of
ventricular fibrillation at the beginning of the case.
2.  The patient sustained a distal aortic dissection as the
catheter was threaded through a tight, diseased iliac artery.

The patient was brought to the Coronary Care Unit for
observation and post-catheterization care, given his
instability in the catheterization laboratory, aortic
dissection, and remaining tight lesions in his coronary
anatomy.  A heparin bolus of 5000 units was given in the
Emergency Department prior to catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis
2.  Deep venous thrombosis
3.  Inferior vena cava filter x 12 years
4.  Hypertension
5.  Right arm fasciotomy status post intravenous dye
injection
6.  Left-sided Port-a-Cath for multiple sclerosis medications
7.  Personality disorder
8.  Chronic constipation
9.  History of pancreatitis

ALLERGIES:   The patient states no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Prilosec, amoxicillin, Coumadin 2
mg by mouth daily at bedtime, Phenergan,  Diltiazem 180 mg by
mouth once daily, Antivert, Baclofen, and Vicodin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a resident at [**Location (un) 2716**] Point.
He denies smoking or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient was unable to give any history
of cardiac illness in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient was afebrile, with a
heart rate of 81, respiratory rate of 13, and blood pressure
of 112/68, with oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.  In
general, the patient was lying in bed, alert and appropriate,
and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination indicated pupils equal, round and reactive to
light, extraocular movements intact.  There was no jugular
venous distention.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally, with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  The neck was
supple, with no jugular venous distention.  Coronary
examination indicated normal S1 and S2, regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.  On
extremity examination, the patient had 3+ edema in his lower
extremities bilaterally, and Dopplerable pulses.  His groin
site was without hematoma or bruit.  Neurologically, the
patient was alert and oriented x 3.

LABORATORY DATA:   Initial laboratory studies
post-catheterization indicated a white count of 5.0,
hematocrit 29.1 which was down from 39.1 prior to
catheterization, and a platelet count of 200.  Chem 7 was
unremarkable.  Magnesium was 1.7, and free calcium was 1.15.
CK #1 was 51, with a troponin of 1.4.  CK #2 was 386 with an
MB fraction of 63 and an index of 16.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiac:  The patient was observed in the Cardiac
Intensive Care Unit for arrhythmia or other signs of
hemodynamic instability following his complicated cardiac
catheterization.  With the exception of one episode of five
beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, no further
episodes of arrhythmia were observed, and the patient was
weaned off of a lidocaine drip.  The patient did not receive
Integrilin following cardiac catheterization secondary to a
recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding.  On further
questioning, the patient indicated that he has had a chronic
problem with gastrointestinal bleeding, and has had a recent
colonoscopy and upper endoscopy which were reportedly
negative.  The patient was started on a beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix following cardiac
catheterization.  His CK peaked at 635, with an MB fraction
of 106.  Troponin peaked at greater than 50.  A lipid panel
was sent, which indicated total cholesterol of 157,
triglycerides of 73, HDL of 41, and LDL of 101.

With regard to the patient's aortic dissection, he remained
hemodynamically stable, with good distal pulses.

Transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and indicated a 30%
ejection fraction, mildly dilated left atrium, mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, apical akinesis, inferoseptal
hypokinesis, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and an anterior
pericardial fat pad.

The patient was sent for a second cardiac catheterization on
hospital day number four, with a goal of intervening upon the
right coronary artery, which had not been intervened upon in
the prior catheterization due to the various complications
during that initial study.  The right coronary artery was
successfully stented in the second catheterization procedure.

Given the patient's apical akinesis, poor ejection fraction,
and history of deep venous thrombosis and inferior vena cava
filter, it was decided that the patient should be started on
long-term anticoagulation.  He was therefore started on a
heparin drip as well as Coumadin 5 mg by mouth daily at
bedtime.  At the time of this discharge dictation, it was
planned that the patient would be discharged on Lovenox and
Coumadin until reaching a therapeutic INR of 2 to 3, at which
point the Lovenox would be discontinued.

Throughout the hospital course, the patient reported several
episodes of chest and abdominal pain.  However, with each
episode, the patient reported pain in a new location, and the
patient was not able to give a consistent description of
these various pains.  Furthermore, there were no
electrocardiogram changes associated with these episodes of
pain, and the pain was thought to be non-cardiac in origin.

At the time of this dictation, it was planned that the
patient would be discharged on a regimen including aspirin,
beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, lipid-lowering therapy, Plavix,
and Coumadin.  He was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

2.  Hematology:  The patient required three transfusions of
one unit of packed red blood cells during his hospital stay
in order to keep his hematocrit above 30.  At the time of
dictation, the patient had been stable from a hematologic
standpoint for 24 hours.

3.  Neurology:  The patient was continued on Antivert for
multiple sclerosis.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient completed a ten day
course of amoxicillin for a urinary tract infection diagnosed
prior to admission, during his hospital course.

DISPOSITION:   At the time of this dictation, the patient was
to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility at [**Location (un) 2716**]
Point.  He was to receive daily INR checks until he reached a
therapeutic level of 2 to 3, at which point Lovenox would be
discontinued.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myocardial infarction
2.  Coronary artery disease
3.  Hypercholesterolemia
4.  Hypertension
5.  Multiple sclerosis
6.  Deep venous thrombosis

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Coumadin 5 mg by mouth daily at
bedtime on the evening of [**12-12**], then 2 mg by mouth
daily at bedtime, Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours
until INR equals 2 to 3, Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily for
30 days, enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily,

ADDENDUM:  On the evening prior to discharge, after receiving
two units of packed red blood cells, the patient subsequently
developed pulmonary edema with an oxygen saturation of 89% on
two liters.  He was also coughing up pink frothy sputum and
had crackles one-half the way up on his pulmonary
examination.  He was given intravenous Lasix 20 mg times
three, with diuresis of approximately 2,100 cc of urine, with
resolution of his pulmonary symptoms.

It was determined that the patient would benefit from oral
Lasix 20 mg daily, which should be added to his discharge
medication regimen.  He will also be discharged on
ciprofloxacin 250 mg orally every other day for urinary tract
infection prophylaxis given his incontinence and Foley
catheter use.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 66 year old
gentleman with a history significant for multiple sclerosis,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, multiple right lower
extremity deep venous thromboses, and chronic GI bleeds, who
was admitted on [**2105-12-26**] with fever, nausea and vomiting.
and tachycardic.  He had two recent admissions, one between
[**12-8**] and [**12-12**], for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction
status post catheterization and stents times two complicated by
ventricular fibrillation arrest and aortic dissection and his
second admission between [**12-15**] and [**12-16**], for chest
pain and neck pain, ruling out for myocardial infarction.

precordial T wave inversions.  He was started on
Nitroglycerin drip, morphine, given aspirin and because of
his hypotension was transferred from the floor to the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was started on Dopamine infusion for
his blood pressure, given Solu-Medrol times one.  He had also
been started on Neo-Synephrine and the following day this was
able to be weaned down.  Meanwhile, blood cultures from the
outlying hospital came back growing four out of four bottles
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The patient was also noted to
have increased liver function tests and acute renal failure.

GI, Renal, Infectious Disease consultations were obtained.  A
right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal common bile
duct, fatty infiltration of his liver and his increased liver
function tests were thought to be secondary to cholestasis
secondary to sepsis/hypotension.  Hepatitis serologies were
negative.  His acute renal failure was thought to be
secondary to ATN from his hypotension.  The patient was on
Ceftaz and Levaquin and sensitivities for Pseudomonas
returned positive for Amikacin, Ceftaz, Ciprofloxacin,
Gentamicin, Imipenem, and Zosyn.  The patient had had an
indwelling left Perma-Cath for his ATCH infusions that he
received every few months for his multiple sclerosis and this
was removed thinking that it may be the source of his
infection, especially as he had reported that it had been red
and tender prior to admission.

His antibiotics coverage was then changed to Ciprofloxacin
and Zosyn.  Chest x-rays at this time started to show
bilateral diffuse patchy opacities.  Chest CT scan showed
ground glass opacities with air bronchograms peripherally.
Septic emboli were entertained as a possible
etiology.  The patient had been on heparin infusion during
the prior month for his myocardial infarction and at this
time his platelets were decreasing significantly.  TTP was
ruled out.  Hemolysis labs were negative.  There was only a
mild to moderate DIC picture due to the infection.  Finally,
a positive HIT test returned and his aspirin was discontinued
secondary to his thrombocytopenia.  All heparin products were
discontinued.  Neurology was consulted for a change in mental
status, but because of his low platelets, a lumbar puncture
was deferred and eventually thought not to be necessary as
his mental status improved.

MRI/MRA/MRV of his head were consistent with multiple
sclerosis but no other acute pathologic changes.  A TTE
showed no vegetations.  TE was delayed until he was more
stable.  Meanwhile, the patient developed a right upper
extremity swelling and was found to have a superficial
femoral vein thrombosis as well as a deep venous thrombosis
of the inferior portion of the jugular vein and right
subclavian vein.  A Hematology consultation was initiated and
they recommended starting a Lepirudin infusion with a goal
PTT of 60.

On the [**12-4**], the patient was stable enough to be
transferred to the Floor.  His respiratory status continued
to improve.  He was coughing up dark reddish brown sputum
which he had been for past week or two.  He continued to be
afebrile.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained and
no vegetations were seen.  A repeat CT scan showed lung
abscesses and an increased and loculated right pleural effusion.
Sputum cultures grew moderate to heavy growth of Pseudomonas. His
Lepirudin was continued, however, at midnight between
[**1-11**] and 12, his Lepirudin was stopped in preparation
for a diagnostic of his right loculated pleural effusion to
rule out empyema.

The thoracentesis occurred at approximately 1 p.m. on
[**1-12**], and the procedure was without incident.  However,
when he returned to his room, he became hypotensive with a
systolic blood pressure drop into the 60s without responding
to fluids.  The patient looked pale and was complaining of
abdominal discomfort, no chest pain, and initially was able
to converse.  He then had one tablespoon of frank hemoptysis.
His lung sounds were rhonchorous and he became diaphoretic.
EKG showed no significant change.

Eventually, the patient became unresponsive and a Code was
called.  Dopamine drip was started.  The patient was in PEA
and Atropine and epinephrine were given per protocol.  CPR
was initiated and continued for 40 minutes.  Bilateral chest
tubes were done with minimal flow of fluid, and a bedside
echocardiogram showed minimal heart activity without
pericardial effusion.  Chest x-ray showed increased right
pleural effusion but no tension pneumothorax.

After 40 minutes of CPR, the patient was pronounced dead at
04:04 p.m.

CAUSE OF DEATH:
1.  Hypotension secondary to pneumonia.

The attending was notified and she notified the family.  A
postmortem was declined.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41-year-old man
with advanced multiple sclerosis who is paraplegic secondary
to this.  He had a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement
approximately a year and a half to two years ago.  The
patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1036**] Nursing Home to
[**Hospital1 26200**] and to [**Hospital6 256**]
for fever to 102.8 axillary with coarse rhonchi and a
distended abdomen.  At [**Hospital1 26200**], he received
Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Flagyl for a presumed bacterial
source of infection that was primarily located in the
abdomen.  His respiratory status was unchanged from his
baseline which is 50% FIO2 at 10 liters.  The patient had
previously been on Ceftin for four days for a urinary tract
infection which he has repeatedly.  The patient denies any
other symptoms in terms of increased sputum production,
chills, myalgias or headache.  He did have diarrhea on the
day prior to presentation but no nausea or vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis diagnosed
approximately seven years ago which has advanced
progressively.  His neurologist is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 **].  They have tried numerous treatments
without any success.  The patient has had complications from
multiple sclerosis of paraplegia, and he is only able to
shake both upper extremities.  He had a tracheostomy and PEG
tube placed approximately a year and a half ago.  He has had
repeated pneumonia requiring constant oxygen with an FIO2 of
approximately 50% and prophylactic Tobramycin nebulizers q12
hours.  He has had MRSA in the past.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ceftin 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. x4 days
of a total 7 day course, Lactulose p.r.n., subcutaneous
Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers,
nebulized Tobramycin 300 mg p.o. q12 hours, Erythromycin
prophylaxis which he has not taken because he has been on the
Ceftin for treatment of a urinary tract infection, G-tube
feeds at 85 cc per hour, Serax 30 mg per G-tube q h.s.,
Baclofen 20 mg in the morning and at night and 10 mg at noon,
Pepcid 40 mg p.o. q day, Reglan 10 mg per G-tube q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at [**Location 1036**].  He has a home
health aide who is with him from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.  He
does not smoke and does not drink alcohol.  Played college
football at [**State 8449**].  He is single.  His father, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **], is his next of [**Doctor First Name **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to [**Hospital6 649**] Intensive Care Unit, temperature was 98.8,
heart rate 102, blood pressure 128/70, respiratory rate 19
and oxygen saturation 99% on 50% FIO2 at 10 liters.  General:
 This was a middle-aged quadriplegic young man in no apparent
distress.  His exam was significant for a tracheostomy with
clear, faint tan secretions that were suctioned approximately
every hour.  His chest had diffuse rhonchi throughout with no
wheezes.  Heart:  S1 and S2.  Regular but tachycardiac.  No
murmurs.  Abdomen:  G-tube which was clean, dry and intact.
His abdomen was distended and tympanitic, but there was no
tenderness, no rebound and no guarding nor organomegaly.
Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.  Neurologic:  Cranial
nerves II-XII were intact.  He moved both upper extremities.
He did not move his lower extremities.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.3, hematocrit 41.8,
platelets 179.  Normal Chem-10 and liver function tests
except for an ALT of 81.  Urinalysis:  Specific gravity
1.025, small blood, 30 protein, trace ketones, no nitrites,
no leukocyte esterase, [**3-28**] white cells, 0 red cells and 0
epithelial cells.  CT scan of the abdomen showed questionable
colonic obstruction and small bowel obstruction with some
thickening of the early jejunum and bilateral lower lobe
consolidation versus atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Problem #1:  Small bowel
obstruction/colonic obstruction.  The patient had a CT scan
which initially showed thickening of the jejunum which was
not read in the official report, however, concerning for
surgery as well.  He was kept n.p.o.  His G-tube was placed
to gravity, and he was aggressively hydrated.  The patient
had a bowel movement on the second day of admission which
relieved much of his distention and his abdominal distention
decreased significantly during his stay.  His tube feedings
were restarted and advanced to goal without any problems.

Problem #2:  Fever.  The patient's fever defervesced after
treatment with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
Vancomycin was stopped after the first dose when it was
discovered that the patient's respiratory status was
unchanged from previously.  He was continued on the
Ceftriaxone for another three days to complete a course of
treatment for a urinary tract infection, and Flagyl was
continued until Clostridium difficile toxin came back
negative.  Stool cultures have not growth at this time as
well as sputum cultures.  Sputum gram stain was contaminated
with oropharyngeal flora.

Problem #3:  Respiratory status.  The patient was at his
baseline respiratory status.  He had antibiotics discontinued
since he did not clinically or radiographically have any
impressive pneumonia.  He was, however, continued on his
prophylactic Tobramycin nebulizers which he should continue
at [**Location (un) 1036**].

Problem #4:  Urinary tract infection.  The patient was
continued on Ceftriaxone to complete a seven day course of
antibiotics for this.  He did not have an impressive
urinalysis for a bladder infection at our hospital, and urine
cultures were negative on the day of discharge.

Problem #5:  Multiple sclerosis.  The patient is currently at
his baseline.  He completely understands everything that goes
on with his surroundings, and his family is very supportive
of him as is his home health aide.  There was no acute change
in his neurologic status.

Problem #6:  Code status.  This was addressed with his
father, and the patient is a full code.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will be discharged on his
admission medications.  However, Ceftin has been changed to
Erythromycin prophylactically, as indicated previously.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to [**Location (un) 1036**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39852**] was admitted to general surgery. Colonoscopic
decompression was attempted by the GI service, but failed to
resolve the volvulus. He was then consented and taken to the OR
for sigmoid resection and end-colostomy with creation of a
Hartmann's pouch. He returned to the floor and was maintained
NPO with IVF/Foley/NGT. With decreased NGT output and with the
passage of stool and flatus into his ostomy bag, the NGT was
removed. His diet was advanced from sips to regular and he
tolerated this well. He was restarted on his coumadin and his
PCP will follow his INR as an outpt.
.
On POD 1, hematuria was noted in his Foley catheter so the
urology team was consulted. His coumadin was temporarily held.
Urinalysis and urine cultures were sent. A 22 Fr 3-way Foley was
placed and CBI was started. CBI was d/c'd once the urine became
clear again. After the Foley was removed, a condom cath was
applied per his home routine and the patient was restarted on
his coumadin. Mr. [**Known lastname 39853**] family will make an appointment to see
urology for follow-up and a cystogram on the same day that he
follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
The patient was triggered on [**2108-11-26**] for desaturations to the
high 80s despite being on 5L of O2. He was noted to have a lot
of secretions and poor cough. Aggressive chest PT was started
and the patient was frequent use of his IS was encouraged.
.
Neurology was consulted for a second opinon regarding the pt's
MS medications. [**Hospital1 **] NIFs, VCs and an ABG were obtained to check
the efficacy of the patient's home BIPAP. ENT was also consulted
per neurology's recommendations to evaluate the patient's
hoarseness/whispering/dysphonia. They recommended outpatient
follow up. No changes were made to the patient's MS medications
at this time. He will follow up with Neurology as an outpatient.

.
The patient was seen frequently by the ostomy nurses while
inpatient. He and his family received ostomy appliance teaching.

.
At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 39852**] was afebrile with stable
vital signs. He was tolerating a regular diet and producing
appropriate amounts of stool and flatus via his ostomy. He was
able to get out of bed to a chair with assistance. His
respiratory status was stable and his O2 saturations were in the
high 90s on room air. He was voiding appropriate amounts of
urine into a condom catheter.

Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-9**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Surgery, Blue Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
white woman with a history of coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass graft, multiple sclerosis, and
hypercholesterolemia who presents with lethargy and purulent
discharge from her vagina.

The patient was brought by her husband to the Emergency Room
at [**Hospital6 33**] because of the lethargy and drainage.
She was evaluated at the [**Hospital6 33**] at which time
there was a high suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis in her
right lower lobe.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
management.

The patient's husband reports that the patient headache a
dilatation and curettage one month ago, and for the last 10
days the patient has had poor oral intake and worsening
lethargy.

At [**Hospital6 33**] the patient was resuscitated with
intravenous fluids and given vancomycin, ceftazidime, and
clindamycin.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history is
significant for)
1.  Multiple sclerosis.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant
for coronary artery bypass graft.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Her social history is unknown.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her home medications were
Pravachol and digoxin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation the
patient's temperature was 97.2, pulse of 84, blood pressure
of 103/41, respiratory rate of 20, and 100%; the patient was
intubated.  On examination, the patient was intubated and
sedated.  She supposedly was alert and oriented times two
prior to her intubation.  Her mucous membranes were noted to
be dry.  Her pupils were equally reactive to light, and
conjunctivae were noted to be clear.  Tympanic membranes were
also clean and intact.  She did not have any jugular venous
distention on examination.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Her heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, tender in the lower quadrants
with no evidence of guarding or palpable mass.  Her rectal
examination was guaiac-positive.  No palpable masses were
noted.  On pelvic examination, the patient was noted to have
a purulent discharge from her vagina.  No mass was palpated.
Her right thigh was noted to be indurated with crepitus
noted.  The patient was noted to have palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses and posterior tibialis pulses on presentation.  Also
noted was that her first great toe bilaterally was noted to
be bluish discoloration.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On presentation,
her white blood cell count was 14.6, her hematocrit was 32.8,
and her platelets were 125.  Her sodium was 136, potassium
of 4.8, chloride of 113, bicarbonate of 12, blood urea
nitrogen of 99, creatinine of 3, blood glucose of 77.  She
was noted to have 10 bands on admission.  Her urinalysis was
noted to have moderate blood, 3 to 5 red blood cells on
microbiology.  Her blood gas was 7.19/32/72/13 and a base
deficit of 14.  Her PT was 15.  Her PTT was 38.1.  Her INR
was 1.6.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   She had a chest x-ray which was within
normal limits.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.  No
evidence of effusion.  No evidence of cardiomegaly.

A CT of her abdomen was noted to have free fluid in her
pelvis.  No evidence of free air in the peritoneal cavity,
and there was a thickened portion in her right colon.  There
was also noted to be some air in the psoas muscle and the
gluteal muscle as well as her thigh.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61-year-old woman transferred
from an outside hospital and noted to have purulent discharge
from her vagina and likely necrotizing fasciitis in her right
thigh.

The patient presented intubated, and on presentation the
patient was quickly further resuscitated with a total of 11
liters of crystalloid.  A PA catheter as well as an arterial
line were placed, and the patient was placed on high-dose
penicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin.  A pressure PA
catheter was not placed.  A central venous catheter was
placed, and the patient was quickly transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

Later in the same day (on [**2139-7-3**]), the patient was
taken to the operating room and underwent an exploratory
laparotomy, appendectomy, Hartmann and sigmoid colostomy, and
opening of her right thigh including fasciotomy.
Intraoperatively, it was noted that the patient had a
perforated sigmoid in the posterior aspect of her sigmoid
colon.  The patient was also noted to have a necrotic
appendix that was perforated.  The patient was also noted to
have focal peritonitis, and there was some purulence found in
her fascia in her right thigh.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit.  A PA catheter was then placed, and the patient
was placed on intravenous antibiotics which included
high-dose penicillin, clindamycin, and meropenem.  The
patient also had to be placed on a dopamine drip and Levophed
to maintain her blood pressure.

On [**7-5**], the patient's condition continued to deteriorate
requiring the addition of epinephrine to maintain vascular
and her blood pressure.  Also noted was that the patient's
cardiac enzymes, and her MB fractions, as well as her
troponin were noted to be significantly elevated.  At that
time, an echocardiogram was obtained as well as an
electrocardiogram which all showed that the patient had
recently suffered an acute myocardial infarction.

Despite these measures, the patient continued to be septic,
and her platelets began to drop initially slowly then quickly
dropped below 50, then below 40.  The patient also became
more and more acidotic requiring ampules of bicarbonate as
well as a bicarbonate drip.  The patient's renal function
also deteriorated, and she became oliguric.

Subsequently, the patient was taken back to the operating
room and underwent a exploration of her right thigh in
addition to a counter incision made in the lateral aspect of
her right thigh opening extra pockets of pus and abscess.
After this area was cleaned and irrigated copiously, the
patient was then returned back to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit in critical condition.

The next day, the Renal Service was consulted for her
oliguria and her persistent acidosis.  At that point, a
Quinton catheter in the patient's left femoral vein, and she
began continuous venovenous hemofiltration (or CVVH).

Over the next three to four days, the patient's clinical
condition actually improved requiring less dosage of her
vasopressors.  The patient's acidosis was also slowing
improving.  Her urine output also improved slightly.  The
patient was then started on total parenteral nutrition, and
she was also started very slowly on tube feeds.  She
initially did not tolerate her tube feeds due to the fact
that her feeding tube was not passed post pylorically.
However, after leaving the feeding tube in her stomach the
patient spontaneously passed the feeding tube post
pylorically and was able to tolerate some of the tube feeds
that were given to her at a rate of 40 cc an hour.  The whole
time, the patient was receiving total parenteral nutrition,
and her clinical condition appeared to improve slightly.

Nevertheless, however, her platelet count continued to drop
so that by [**7-6**], the patient's platelet count had dropped
to 28.  After multiple transfusions of platelets, the patient
had likely developed anti-platelet antibody and was able to
continually drop her platelets despite multiple transfusions.
At this point, it was decided to not transfuse her anymore
unless the platelets were washed, but unfortunately the blood
bank did not have washed platelets to give to the patient.

However, despite her platelets dropping to as low as 11, the
patient's hematocrit remained relatively stable and did not
require large amounts of blood transfusions.

Nevertheless, the patient's clinical condition remained
relatively stable.  Her base pressors were reduced only to
dopamine renally dosed.  This lasted for a few days until
[**7-12**] when the patient suddenly developed an episode of
bradycardia and almost asystole.  Although, the patient's
heart rate spontaneously returned to her baseline, her blood
pressure remained low requiring increasing her dopamine drip
from an initial renal dose to up to 10, even as high as 15.

On [**7-13**], the patient's clinical picture continued to
deteriorate.  She became more and more acidotic.  Her blood
pressure became more labile, dropping spontaneously to the
80s and requiring increases in her pressors.  Her dopamine
went up to 15.  Despite that, the patient's blood pressure
still spontaneously dropped to the 80s.  Moreover, her
acidosis got worse.  Her lactate had increased up to 10, and
her base deficit had increased to greater than 12.  Despite
having the patient on continuous venovenous hemofiltration,
her acidosis did not improve.  Meanwhile, her platelets
continued to drop to as low as 9 on [**7-13**].  There was also
evidence of some bleeding.  Her conjunctivae, at that point,
were noted to be completely red showing evidence of bleed.
Moreover, she was noted to have a large ecchymotic area in
her left flank, showing a possible retroperitoneal bleed as
well.

At this point, a Swan-Ganz catheter was refloated, giving the
patient platelets as well as fresh frozen plasma.  The fresh
frozen plasma was given since the patient suddenly had become
coagulopathic and her PT went up to as high as 26 with an INR
going up a high as 5.  After refloating the Swan-Ganz
catheter, the patient was noted to have adequate platelets,
however, she became progressively oliguric.  Despite
continuous venovenous hemofiltration, she became more and
more acidotic.

At this point, the patient's family was notified of her poor
prognosis.  On [**7-14**], the family spoke with the attending
(Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**]) and relayed their wishes to perhaps
withdraw care in this patient.  On [**7-14**], it was also noted
that the patient's pupils had now become fixed and dilated,
with a very slow and sluggish in her left pupil, indicating
that the patient most likely may bled to her head, herniating
her brain on the right.

At this point, a Neurology consultation was obtained.
Neurology attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] evaluated the patient, and
it was determined that the patient very likely had herniated
her brain with very minimal brain stem activity.  The only
function left was mostly secondary to reflex.

At that point, a family meeting was held consisting of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] (the neurologist), as well as family
members (which included the patient's daughter as well as the
patient's husband and other family members).  This family
meeting was held on [**7-14**], and the discussion regarding the
patient's prognosis was made.  At this point, the family
wished to make the patient comfort measures only given the
patient's very poor prognosis.

Subsequently, on [**7-14**], at 2:30 p.m., the patient's family
decided at that point to withdraw care and her vasopressors
were then discontinued, and the patient expired quickly
thereafter.  Inquiry was made to the family regarding a
postmortem; however, the patient's family refused a
postmortem.  The patient's family was present when the
patient expired.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] was well aware.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Necrotizing fasciitis.
2.  Perforated sigmoid colon.
3.  Perforated appendix.
4.  Sepsis/sepsis shock.
5.  Multiorgan failure which included kidney failure and
possibly liver failure as well.  The patient's coagulation
system also failed.

US guided cholecytostomy
CLINICAL INDICATION: Acute cholecystitis, patient with severe
multiple sclerosis, unable to tolerate general anesthesia.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided cholecystostomy tube
placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50416**] was evaluated in the emergency department at [**Hospital1 18**]
after transfer from [**Hospital3 8544**] on [**2164-9-15**]. His liver enzymes
were elevated, and his WBC count was 18. He was seen and
admitted by the surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for cholecystitis.

He was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl; IV fluids were
initiated; and he was placed NPO. An abdominal ultrasound was
performed which was concerning for cholecystitis. There was no
evidence of common duct obstruction. His total bilirubin was
slightly decreased from 0.9 on admission to 0.8, suggesting a
passed stone. ERCP was postponed and it was decided that a
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube would be placed with interval
laparascopic cholecystectomy to minimize the surgical impact to
his multiple sclerosis.

On HD 2 an ultrasound guided cholecystostomy tube was placed
without problems. 30ml of purulent material was drained and sent
for culture. The gram stain was negative. Please see OP note for
details. On HD 3 he spiked a temperature of 102.8.  His IV
antibiotics were changed to Zosyn. By HD 4 his WBC count and
liver enzymes were trending down. His bile fluid culture was
negative for growth. He was afebrile and his diet was advanced.
Neurology saw him and felt that his current therapy was
satisfactory and that he should continue his present medication
regimen with baclofen for spatiscity.

During hospitalization he was evaluated and treated by physical
therapy to increase strength and functional mobility. It was
recommended that he be discharged home with continued physical
therapy.

On [**2164-9-20**] he was discharged home in good condition.  He was to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] in [**1-9**] weeks.  He was
to receive VNA visits for drain care and home physical therapy.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 15174**] for treatment of
altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52 year old woman with past medical history
significant for chronic pain on narcotics and benzodiazepines,
malabsorption syndrome due to complications of gastric bypass
surgery, and severe osteoporosis.  Three days prior to her
admission to the outside hospital, the patient presented to her
PCP's office for evaluation of ~20 pound weight loss that had
occurred over the past 6-8 weeks.  The patient was found to have
a urinary tract infection, and she was prescribed Ciprofloxacin.
 The patient took two doses of the antibiotic.  The following
day, the patient's husband noted that his wife seemed very
nervous and agitated.  He called the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] advised the
patient to discontinue the Ciprofloxacin.  That evening, the
patient's husband noted that the patient was laughing
inappropriately while she watched TV.  She thought the TV was
""talking to her.""  The patient's husband called 911, but by the
time the EMTs arrived at their home, the patient was able to
answer questions correctly, and she refused to go to the
hospital.  The following morning, the patient was noted to be
more agitated, paranoid, and delusional, so her huaband called
911 again.  This time, the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 15174**].
   On presentation to the outside hospital, the patient was
noted to have a low grade temperature (100.2). Her neurologic
exam was reported as ""non-focal,"" and a non-contrast head CT was
negative for bleed. The patient's tox screen was negative for
ETOH.  Her other laboratory data was unremarkable.  The patient
was admitted to the hospital for treatment of narcotic
withdrawal.
   During her 36 hour hospitalization, the patient was given two
doses of Buprenex.  Subsequently, the patient became lethargic,
confused, combative, and agitated.  She was transferred to the
ICU for further management.  She was given a few doses of Haldol
and Ativan for her agitation.  Lumbar puncture was unsuccessful.
 Given her persistent agitation and concern for narcotic
withdrawal, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 12258**]): Pt had an LP and the results of
the CSF analysis were unremarkable. Her mental status improved
in ICU and she became much more alert and was oriented by the
morning of the second hospital day. While in the ICU, the
chronic pain service was consulted. Their recommendations are
noted below.

2. Altered mental status: As above, the pt. underwent a lumbar
puncture, the results of which were not suggestive of CNS
infection as the cause of her encephalopathy.  A TSH, B12 and
electrolytes were sent which were all within normal limits. An
RPR was sent and was nonreactive. Upon further discussion with
the pt. when she became more alert, it was discovered that after
taking the first two doses of ciprofloxacin the week prior to
admission, the pt. became extremely nauseous and had episodes of
emesis and diarrhea.  This led the pt. to stop taking her
narcotics which she is on chronically for pain.  Thus, it was
believed that the pt's. altered mental status was secondary to
narcotics withdrawal.  It should be noted, however, that
ciprofloxacin has been associated with acute psychosis,
seizures, and acute delirium.

3. Chronic pain: The pt. reported that she had been on large
doses of oxycontin, valium and neurontin for pain in her right
shoulder, back and legs prior to admission.  In the context of
her heavy narcotics use, a chronic pain service consult was
obtained while the pt. was in the intensive care unit.  They
recommended stopping oxycontin and decreasing the dose of
valium.  In addition, they recommended continuing neurontin and
adding methadone.  The pt. initially tolerated this regimen
well.  However, on the fourth hospital day, the pt. continued to
complain of leg spasms.  Baclofen was introduced with some
success in relieving her spasms.
The pain service also recommended that the pt. be started on
celecoxib for musculoskeletal pain but this was held over the
concern of possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the
setting of iron deficiency anemia of yet uncertain etiology.

4. Iron deficiency anemia:  The pt. was found to have profound
iron deficiency anemia on admission.  Further discussion with
the pt. and her PCP revealed that the pt. has known iron
deficiency and has received supplementation in the past.  A
gastroenterology consult was called.  They had recommended
performing both colonoscopy to examine for occult malignancy
(especially in the face of recent unintentional weight loss and
cachexia) and an EGD to evaluate the anatomy of her upper GI
tract in light of her prior gastric bypass.  The pt. did not
desire to undergo these procedures during this inpatient
hospitalization, but agreed to follow-up for these studies on an
outpatient basis.  The importance of following-up regarding this
issue was explicitly stressed to the pt. prior to discharge.
She was discharged on 325mg of ferrous sulfate once per day.

5. Weight loss/cachexia/?malabsorption:  In light of the pt's.
~20 pounds over the 6 to 8 weeks prior to admission, a nutrition
consult was obtained.  They had recommended TPN in addition to
encouraging the pt. to increase her p.o. intake.  The pt. did
received three days of TPN through a PICC line in addition to a
regular diet.  There was, again, concern over occult malignancy
which further prompted the desire to perform a colonoscopy.  A
breast exam was also performed as a part of a malignancy work-up
and was unremarkable.  The pt. stated that she has had a
""negative"" mammography within the last year.
The gastroenterology service also raised the possibility of
celiac disease and tTG-IgA and endomysial antibodies were sent
and were pending at the time of discharge.
There is also the possibility that her weight loss is secondary
to her profound depression with vegetative symptoms.

6. Depression: The pt. admitted to severe depression in the
months prior to admission.  As such, the psychiatry service was
consulted.  They recommended re-starting fluoxetine which was
done at a dose of 20mg per day.

7. Osteoporosis: The pt. was started on calcium and vitamin D
supplementation.

8. Migraine Headaches: The pt. complained of headache suggestive
of typical (not classical) migraine.  Her pain was not relieved
with acetaminophen.  A trial of subcutaneous sumatriptan,
however, did provide relief.  She was discharged with a
prescription for subcutaneous sumatriptan with instructions to
stop taking the medication if she experienced flushing,
dizziness, fatigue (suggestive of serotonin syndrome due to
concomitant use of fluoxetine).

History of Present Illness:
69 yo man with baseline MS uncommunicative who was sent from his
nursing home out of concern for leukocytosis to 23 and loose
stool. He also had BRBPR this morning. Of note he was recently
admitted for pna (mrsa/klebsiella) [**Date range (1) 60426**] and was discharged
on vanco (last [**8-27**])/meropenum ([**9-5**]). Per his son at his
nursing home the last few days he has had copious diarrhea that
more recently has had blood in it, vomitting, and has been
sweating profusely at night without fevers or obvious rigors.
His son can not relate other obvious recent localizing signs or
symptoms but is concerned about recurrence or further CVA as he
had similar symptoms at the time of his right MCA CVA in [**Month (only) 116**]. He
notes MS appear to be at baseline though in the ED his son says
he was more 'out of it.'
.
In the ED, VS: 98.2, 72 108/54 20 98% on RA. Within 2 hours his
BP dropped to 60/40 so a femoral line was inserted. He received
1L NS and his BP improved to 116/58. HR throughout was 70-84. He
was noted to be guaiac +. Also in the ED his son seemed to
communicate with him that he (patient) was having chest pain so
he was given morphine 2mg iv and oxygen with improvement in his
moaning.
.
ROS: Unobtainable per se but he does repeatedly ask for 'agua'
which is not normal for him per his son and coughs during
interview/exam, wet sounding but non-productive.

CXR ([**9-23**]): No consolidation or edema is evident. The
mediastinum is
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for
size. No
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. A G-tube is in place in the
left upper
quadrant. IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

TTE ([**9-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2189-1-15**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo man with multiple medical problems including advanced
dementia, recent CVA, h/o of multiple multi-drug resistant
infections who presented on [**9-23**] with diarrhea, septic shock,
myocardial ischemia, acute renal failure and guaiac + stool.
.
In the ED, VS: 98.2, 72 108/54 20 98% on RA. Within 2 hours his
BP dropped to 60/40 so a femoral line was inserted. He received
1L NS and his BP improved to 116/58. HR throughout was 70-84. He
was noted to be guaiac +. Also in the ED his son seemed to
communicate with him that he (patient) was having chest pain so
he was given morphine 2mg iv and oxygen with improvement in his
moaning.
.
# Septic shock: In the ED, VS: 98.2, 72 108/54 20 98% on RA.
Within 2 hours his BP dropped to 60/40 so a femoral line was
inserted. He received 1L NS and his BP improved to 116/58. He
was transferred to the ICU where he was aggressivly volume
resuscitated to maintain MAP >65. With his h/o VRE, MRSA, ESBL
klebsiella, he was covered with linezolid, meropenum, IV flagyl
and PO Vanco. Urinalysis c/w UTI. Am cortisol was within normal
limits.  He remained afebrile and normotensive (his BP
medications were held). After stabilization overnight, he was
transferred to the floor.  His urine culture grew 2 morphologies
of Klebsiella resistant to Cipro and Cefuroxime but sensitive to
Bactrim.  So after 5 days of IV Meropenem he was switched to PO
Bactrim DS for 9 more days (total 14 day course).
.
#C. Difficile Colitis: Arrived with diarrhea but soon became
constipated so C. Diff toxin could not be sent.  He had loose
stool on hospital day 4.  Given his history, however, he was
empirically treated with 4 days of IV Flagyl and 4 days of PO
Vanco. He was then transitioned to just PO Vanco for a total 14
day course.
.
# Acute myocardial ischemia: Pt.'s son said his father was
complaining of chest pain, though staff did not observe this.
His EKG showed ST elevation. Troponin peaked at 0.39. Patient
was initially started on heparin gtt, ASA 325, simvastatin 80mg.
However, he was then seen by cardiology who felt the changes
were due to hypotension in the setting in sepsis, the did not
want to proceed to catheterization and suggested stopping
heparin gtt in setting of h/o SDH along with guiac + stools.
Repeat TTE was similar to prior studies and showed no wall
motion abnormalities. Once normotensive, the patient was
re-started on home metoprolol and lisinopril.
.
# Acute renal failure with uremia: Came in with BUN 97 and
Creatinine of 0.8. His medications were renally dosed. After
aggressive fluid resusciation, his creatinine decreased to 0.3
and his BUN slowly decreased throughout his stay.  He had good
urine output throughout this hospitalization.
.
# Acute Blood Loss anemia and chronic iron deficiency anemia:
Guaiac positive stool on arrival in the setting of suspected C.
Diff colitis. Hematocrit dropped from 39 to 30 and then stayed
stable between 30 and 33 throughout the rest of his stay. Recent
baseline HCT in the low 30's, with suspected hemoconcentration
on arrival, repeat at baseline despite guaiac + stools. Iron
studies in [**5-20**] with low iron, normal ferritin, low binding
capactiy but ratio approx 10% so likely a component of iron
deficiency.  No further hemodynamic signs of bleeding.
.
# h/o Hypertension: In the MICU, his [**Last Name (un) **] clonidine, lisinopril,
metoprolol were held.  Upon transfer to the floor, he was
restarted on home metoprolol.  His systolic blood pressure
remained >130 and he was started on home lisinopril the
following day.  His clonidine was never restarted and he did not
have any hypertension during his hospitalization.
.
# H/O Ischemic CVA: [**5-20**], pt. with baseline left hemiparesis,
limited vocalization, continued the patient on aspirin 325mg and
monitored neuro exam closely.  There was no clear change in
neuro exam . Family stated that the patient was at his baseline
throughout the stay.
.
# Diabetes: Given high home insulin dose and unstable intake was
covered with insulin gtt for optimal glucose control and
switched to SSI with glargine 20ccs to begin (home dose 80ccs).
Once tube feeds were started his glargine was increased to 30.
It may need to be titrated up as needed to previous home dose of
60ccs.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on his home
levothyroxine.
.
# Elevated alk phos: Mild, t.bili low, ggt elevated.  Will need
follow up as an outpatient
.
#Sacral Decub Wound: Stage 2, followed by wound care nursing.

Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Irrigation and debridement, left open carpal dislocation
    closed reduction, anterior capsular repair, carpal
    tunnel release and placement of external fixator.
2. Closed reduction right carpal dislocation, release of
    carpal tunnel, anterior capsular repair and placement of
    external fixator.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 28 year old man with no known medical
history who is s/p fall from approximately 25 feet with no LOC
but does have left facial abrasions, who was transferred from an
OSH after 2 reported seizures requiring intubation.

Per the OSH records, the patient fell 20-25 feet from a 6 foot
ladder onto a deck, with reportedly negative LOC but he had
multiple abrasions to his left face and head and bilateral open
wrist fractures. He reportedly lost his balance and slipped off
the ladder when doing construction work. In the ambulance, he
received Morphine 4 mg IV x1, was placed in a C-collar, and his
wrists were splinted.

He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, where vitals were
temp 98.1, bp 127/56, HR 78, RR 15, SaO2 98% on RA. He
complained
of moderate aching neck pain, and bilateral wrist pain. He also
had frontal pain. On exam, he was alert and oriented x3 (GCS
15),
two 5 cm lacs to his upper scalp and left facial abrasion,
diffusely sore in his neck. Labs showed WBC 9.0, Hct 39, plt
233,
INR 1.1, Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 104, CO2 24, BUN 13, Cr 0.87, glucose
122, Ca 9.3. Head CT was reported as normal (and although he was
sent with a CD, it was reportedly blank and unable to be
uploaded
to the [**Hospital1 **] system). CT C-spine showed no fracture. Right wrist
films showed scaphoid fracture and perilunate dislocation. Left
wrist films showed perilunate dislocation and displaced scaphoid
fracture. CXR and pelvic films were normal. Per the nursing
assessment, at 17:22 he had ""seizure activity after having CT
done"", then ""second seizure noted with Ativan 1 mg IV given"".
There is no recorded description of the event or indication of
its duration. He was loaded with Dilantin 1000 mg IV. After the
event at 18:00 it was documented that he was combative and
attempting to get up so additional Ativan 1 mg IV was given. At
18:28 he was reportedly ""postical ....combative and attempting
to
get up, agitated."" He was intubated, and given Fentanyl 100 mcg
x2 and 150 mcg x1, Vec 10 mg x1. He was also given Cefazolin 1
gram IV, Dilaudid 1 mg IV. He was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Intubated, getting agitated off sedation trying
to
sit up in bed. Does not follow commands to open/close eyes. Does
follow commands to show 2 fingers on the right hand and briefly
gives thumbs up on the left hand. Unable to test for hand grasp
given wrist splints in place.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to
1 mm bilaterally, but brisker on the right. Corneal reflexes
intact bilaterally but brisker on the left.  No obvious facial
asymmetry.

Motor: Normal tone in the bilateral UE and LE. No observed
myoclonus or tremor. Patient spontaneously moves his bilateral
UE
and LE against gravity.

Reflexes: 3+ and symmetric in biceps, triceps, and knees. 3+ in

intrathoracic, abdominal or pelvic trauma.
2. Minimal bullous changes in the right apex.
3. Left carpal deformity - correlate with radiograph.

[**2187-12-5**] Head CT : 1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Ill-defined 1 cm area of hypodensity in the subcortical white

right frontal lobe is likely chronic. Comparison with prior CT,
clinical
correlation. MRI of the brain on a non-emergent basis may be

[**2187-12-5**] CT C Spine : No acute fracture or malalignment of the
cervical spine

[**2187-12-5**] Xray Bilat upper ext : 1. [**Month/Day/Year **] compatible with
bilateral trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocations.
2. Normal elbows.

[**2187-12-6**] MRI C Spine : 1. Extensive T2 and STIR hyperintensities
involving the cervical spine and in the visualized portions of
the thoracic spine, which in conjunction with the [**Month/Day/Year 4493**] in
the brain is most concerning for a demyelinating process such as
ADEM or multiple sclerosis. Other forms of myelitis are
considered less likely.
  2. Interspinous soft tissue edema raises concern for mild
interspinous
ligamentous injury. However, no ligamentous disruption is noted.


[**2187-12-6**] MRI Head :
  . Extensive pericallosal, periventricular, subcortical and
deep white matter foci as well as abnormal signal in the
posterior fossa, the corpus callosum, the optic nerves, and at
least one focus of cortical involvement. The [**Month/Day/Year 4493**] are highly
concerning for a demyelinating process such as ADEM or multiple
sclerosis. Other differential diagnoses would include toxic
metabolic processes and infection, although these are considered
much less likely, given the callosal, optic nerve, posterior

 Interpretation
 --------------
The oligoclonal band assay detected 4 or more IgG bands in the
CSF,
which are not present in the serum.
This is a POSITIVE result.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
team and subsequently admitted to the Trauma ICU where he
remained intubated and sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl while
undergoing serial neurologic exams and further imaging. Although
true seizure activity was in question his Dilantin continued and
the length of treatment would be dependent on any further
seizure activity and EEG testing off sedation.

The Neurology service followed him closely and recommended an
MRI of the brain to further delineate the right frontal
hypodense area seen on head CT.  The [**Known lastname 4493**] were specific for
some type of demyelinating process (ie Multiple Sclerosis) and
were not related to trauma.

He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2187-12-7**] where he
underwent 1. Irrigation and debridement, left open carpal
dislocation, closed reduction, anterior capsular repair, carpal
tunnel release and placement of external fixator and 2. Closed
reduction right carpal dislocation, release of carpal tunnel,
anterior capsular repair and placement of external fixator. He
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable
condition.  His sedation was gradually weaned and he was
eventually extubated without any difficulty.

Following extubation he was awake, alert, with fluent speech,
though disoriented and somewhat agitated.  He improved
dramatically over the next 24 hours except for a temperature
spike to 101.  He was pan cultured and also underwent LP to rule
out HSV encephalitis as well as oligoclonal band testing to rule
out multiple sclerosis.  In the interim he was briefly treated
with acyclovir.  His HIV ab was negative as was his HSV in his
CSF.  He did have oligoclonal bands in his CSF which could aid
in the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.

From the standpoint of his traumatic accident he remained free
of any seizure activity, his mental status was improving daily
and he was coping well with his bilateral wrist injuries.  He
was transferred to the Trauma floor where he continued to make
good progress.  The Physical Therapy service worked with him
daily as did the Occupational therapist. His weight bearing
status for his upper extremities was non weight bearing for his
hands but full weight bearing for his forearms.  He will have
VNA services for home Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.

Prior to discharge he underwent an EEG to rule out any seizure
activity. He had some intermittent delta wave slowing in the
right temporal region and will continue on dilantin until his
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] and then be re evaluated.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56yo man with PMH significant for multiple sclerosis, unclear
type, and MI s/p stenting presents with an episode of total body
weakness and associated slurred speech.  He reports that at 10pm
last night he had the sudden onset of loss of feeling and use of
all 4 extremities while he was sitting watching medicine. He
reports he has had simlilar episodes before but never as severe.
 He had bowel incontinence and was unable to get up to get help.
 He also reports have slurred speech at the time.  His ex-sister
in-law came to check on him and called an ambulance.  He was
seen at [**Hospital3 417**] hospital where a head CT was reportedly
""normal"".  Currently reports being back to his baseline since
3am.  Denies f/c/CP/SOB/abdominal pain.

In the ED, inital vitals were 98.0 70 91/54 16 100% RA.  At the
time of admission to our ED, the patient reported that he was
back at his baseline.  Neuro reported ""On examination, he has a
R RAPD, L red desaturation, BLE>BUE, L>R hypertonia, L sided
weakness, and decreased sensation in the left lower leg. It is
unknown how much of this is baseline or if any is new. He is
also a fairly unreliable historian, which makes it difficult to
further assess and localize his deficits. By history alone,
weakness of all extremities usually localizes to the c-spine,
esp with fecal incontinence, but the slurred speech indicates a
location in the brain. He describes listing to the right, so
perhaps he had mostly right sided weakness with the old left
sided weakness. It is also possible that he became hypotensive
and had reexpression of prior bilateral deficits. Head CT shows
many periventricular white matter lesions."" While in the ED, he
became hypotensive to the SBP 70's despite 3L NS.  Tox screen
was negative.   He did not receive pressors or central venous
access.  Urine out put was 500cc while in the ED.  He was
admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.


Past Medical History:
-- Multiple Sclerosis -diagnosed reportedly in [**2189**] by MRI,
secondary to symptoms of dysequilibrium and falls. He feels he
has not had any episodes but has been slowly progressing. He
started using a cane at the time of diagnosis, then within a
year progressed to a walker, and for the last year has been
requiring a wheelchair for long distances. Took avonex x 1 yr
and had episodes of difficulty moving just after taking the
medication, somewhat like the current complaint. He started
copaxone 1 yr later
-- s/p MI/2 stents [**2189**]
-- Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
Lives alone but his [**Last Name (un) **] lives in [**Location 59316**] down the hallway;
uses walker to get around his apartment and electric wheelchair
if he goes out.  Quit smoking and ETOH in [**2189**] when he was
diagnosed with MS.

CARDIAC ECHO [**11-20**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-12-5**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is improved.

[**11-18**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: Diffuse periventricular FLAIR and T2 hyperintensities
are consistent with chronic multiple sclerosis. Several
subcentimeter foci that are bright on diffusion-weighted imaging
are not clearly identified on ADC map and therefore no
correlative information is available. These areas may represent
more acute plaque formation, although they are difficult to
characterize without correlative information. There are no foci
of abnormal enhancement. The intracranial vertebral and internal
carotid arteries and their major branches appear normal without
evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
IMPRESSION: Extensive chronic multiple sclerosis, without
evidence of enhancing plaques. Vascular structures are
unremarkable.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] SCAN WITH CONTRAST
FINDINGS: Multiple small foci of increased signal intensity on
STIR and T2 weighted imaging in the spinal cord are most
prominent near C2-3, C3-4, between C5-7 and in the medulla.
At C3-4, an anterior osteophyte that touches the anterior cord.
A tiny midline disc protrusion at this level also touches the
cord.
At C4-5, an uncovertebral osteophyte slightly flattens the
anterior cord.
At C5-6, a large osteophyte causes severe bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing.
At C6-7, images are limited by motion but are grossly
unremarkable.
There is no enhancing lesion in the cord.
IMPRESSION:
1) Multiple foci of STIR and T2 hyperintensity are consistent
chronic multiple sclerosis. There are no enhancing cord lesions.
2) Degenerative changes as noted above.

Pyelonephritis
C.difficle colitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 43 year-old female with a complicated history of
multiple sclerosis with a resultant neurogenic bladder and
chronic pyelonephritis, who was transferred from an OSH for a
liver transplant consult s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 10964**] overdose.   She has been
taking large amounts of [**First Name3 (LF) 10964**] (3.5-5gm/day) for the last two
years to help alleviate her chronic abdominal pain and flank
pain from pyelonephritis.  She was in her usual state of health,
until approximately three weeks ago, when she presented to an
OSH with abdominal pain, flank pain, vomiting, hypoglycemia,
high wbc count, and dysphagia.   Six days prior to admission at
[**Hospital1 18**], after spending two weeks at the OSH, she returned home
with the diagnosis of viral enteritis.  Upon returning home, she
developed severe right upper quadrant pain at rest that was
rated a [**11-22**].  The pain was of similar quality to her previous
pain at the OSH, constant, sharp, non-radiating, and increasing
with palpation.  She experienced N/V (no blood) and a decreased
appetite, but denied any shortness of breath, chest pain, bright
red blood per rectum, or melena.  To alleviate her abdominal
pain, she increased her pain medication to 10 tabs of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] (5
gm/day) and Percocet 2 tabs q3hr (16tab x .325 = 5.2gm).  Two
days prior to admission, she took an additional 10 tablets of
Darvoset.   Her boyfriend found her unresponsive at home, and
took her to the OSH.
.
At the OSH, patient??????s vital signs were temp 97, heart rate 74,
blood pressure 98/52, respiratory rate 15, and O2 sat  96% RA.
She was noted to be lethargic with slurred speech.  Her serum
acetominophen level, measured approximately 6 hours after
overdose, was found to be 220mg/ml.  There was no clear time of
last ingestion. She was started on acetylcysteine.  For her
blood sugar of 21, she was given D50W.   A nasogastric tube was
placed, which yielded heme positive coffee grounds followed by
bilious material.  She was guaiac positive.  A KUB showed
increased stool without obstruction.
.
Labs at OSH included: WBC 14.8  HCT 43, plt 226.  NA 145, K 3.8,
Cl 112, HCO3 19, BUN 26,  CR 1.0.  Glucose 21.  AST 1394  ALT
2995  LDH 4039  Ammonia 16.  Urine toxicology screen was
positive for Benzo, THC, Prophoxypteme
.
One day prior to admission, the patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for a liver transplant consult.  Her vital signs were
stable.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was given acetylcysteine @ 3.2 gm
q4h IV, D5W @75cc/hr, and then switched to D10W for a finger
stick blood glucose in the 50s. For her N/V, she was given
ativan 2mg IV and anzemet 12.5mg. Her abdominal pain was treated
with dilaudid 0.5 mg IV.
.
In the MICU, acetylcysteine was continued at @ 3.2 gm q4h IV,
ativan was continued at 1mg IV q4hours for nausea, and dilaudid
was given 0.5mg IV q3hours for abdominal pain.  She was
maintained on D5NS 100cc/hr.  During this time, she became
febrile to 101.2.  Urine cultures grew E.coli, and she was
started on Ceftriaxone.
.
After 24 hours of observation in the MICU, she was transferred
to medicine.  At the time of the interview, the patient
complained of RUQ and RLQ pain [**11-22**] which was dulled to an [**9-22**]
with dilaudid.  In addition, she reported left flank pain that
developed one day prior to admission.  She reports constipation,
+N/V, and a decreased appetite.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 year-old female with a complicated history of
multiple sclerosis with a resultant neurogenic bladder and
chronic pyelonephritis, who presented approximately 24 hours s/p
[**Month/Year (2) 10964**] overdose.  Her hospitalization was complicated by
pyelonephritis, c.difficle colitis, and hypotension.

1.	[**Month/Year (2) 10964**] Overdose/Liver failure. Patient reported that large
quantities of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] were taken for pain control, with no
intent of hurting self.   There is no clear time of patient??????s
last ingestion, and given her chronic use of [**Month/Year (2) 10964**] and recent
increase in acetominophen intake, the obtained concentration is
may not represent her peak concentration.  Serum acetominophen
at 6 hours 220, 12 hours 107, 18 hours 24. During the hospital
course, the patient's liver function improved.
She was monitored by the hepatology team for the need of a liver
transplantation with [**Doctor Last Name 3728**] college criteria for liver
transplantation.  No transplantation was needed. Liver enzymes
were measured q12 hours and steadily improved and NAC was
continued until her liver function tests normalized on hospital
day #5.
normalized within first week of hospitalization. Amylase and
lipase were also monitored, and although nml on admission,
reached peaks on [**4-11**] and have subsequently trended down.
PT/INR/PTT were measured q6h with no evidence of coagulopathy.
There were no signs of hepatic encephalopathy - no changes in MS
no signs of asterixes during admission.
	
2.  UTI/Pyelonephritis: Pt with h/o recurrent UTIs likely [**3-17**]
neurogenic bladder. Pt has MS and, although + UOP, often must
straight cath herself at home. Patient developed a severe [**11-22**]
L flank on day 1 of hospitalization, which increased with
palpation and did not radiate.  She spiked a fever to 101.2 and
complained of N/V.  Given patient??????s history of chronic
pyelonephritis, self-catherization, and clinical findings, this
is most likely pyelonephritis.  Urine culture + for E.coli and
Enterococcus. Patient was initially started on ceftriaxone 1 gm
IV q24hours.  On day 4, the urine culture was + for E.coli.
Imipenum 500mg IV q6hours was started and ceftriaxone was
d/c'ed.  On day 7, the urine culture was + enterococcus, and the
patient was started on Vancomycin 1000mg IV q12.  Repeat urine
cx from [**4-10**] had no growth. Mr. [**Known lastname 61332**] complete 2 week course
of imipenem while in house. She was discharged on day 10 of
vancomycin, with home health arranged to administer last 4
doses. She had foley in during most of admission, but was making
good UOP after foley removed. Given neurogenic bladder, pt self
caths as needed at home.

3.	Colitis/diffuse abdominal pain.  Patient with diarrhea,
abdominal pain, leukocytosis occurring after antibiotic
administration.  Pt has chronic abd pain and [**Month (only) **] peristalsis,
thought to be [**3-17**] autonomic dysfunction. Pt had NGT in place on
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Given abd pain and large amount of drainage
suctioned on arrival, she had KUB/CT scan r/o obstrcution.
KUB/CT from [**3-31**] without evidence of obstruction. However, given
interval increase in pain of RUQ and RLQ repeat abd CT was done
on [**4-3**] with evidence of development of colonic wall thickening,
involving the transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending
colon, findings that are consistent with colitis.  Stool culture
+ for c. diff.  Patient was maintained on 1000 ml NS continuous
at 150 ml/hr. On hospital day 5, Flagyl 500mg IV tid was started
and continued throught admission. Follow up CT on [**4-11**] with
diffuse mesenteric and subcutaneous edema. Unremarkable
appearance of small bowel and colon on this examination with no
wall thickening and apparent resolution of colitis. Pt continued
to have abd pain during admission which was managed to her
satisfaction with dilaudid. On [**4-14**] she noted inc distention of
abd/no BMX3 days and repeat KUB was done to r/u obstruction. KUB
significant only for small dilated loop of bowel in small int
which is attributed to her chronic poor gut
motility/peristalsis. Given that she was on broad spectrum IV
abx until day of discharge, 14 day course of PO flagyl was
started on discharge.
Please see nutrition section for more info, but briefly pt not
tolerating PO and inc secretions via NGT early during admission
- so TPN started on [**4-2**]. Attempted clamping of NGT periodically
but not tolerated until [**4-12**]. Finally, pt tolerating liquids and
soft custards and NGT pulled out on [**4-14**]. Pt continued on cycled
TPN, which was continued on discharge.
3.	Anemia and upper GI bleed.  On admission, patient's HCT had
dropped from 40.6-32.6 (In 24 hours).   NG lavage at OSH showed
coffee ground particles and LBM tonight consisted of a scant amt
of dark red blood.  Given [**Month/Day (2) **] o/d, differential for Upper GI
bleed at that time included gastritis, esophagitis,
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (from vomiting), PUD, Dieulafoy??????s lesion.
Endoscopy was done at OSH.   NGT aspirate and stools were guaiac
positive.  Patient remained stable throughout hospital course
until evening of [**4-2**] when she experienced inc bloody aspirate
from NGT - hct remained stable but GI was consulted for further
management. Given stable hct and recent EGD at OSH, she was
managed conservatively with serial hct checks. Hct slowly
drifted down from 31.0 on [**4-2**] to 24.8 on [**4-6**] at which time she
was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs. Hct bumped appropriately and was
stable throughout remainder of admission.  Will cont PPI on
discharge

4.	Hypoglycemia.  Resolved during hospitalziation.  This was
most likely secondary from hepatic dysfunction -> decrease in
glucose production in setting of [**Month/Year (2) **] overdose.

6.	N/V.  Pt has had nausea for many years, but much increased
during this admisison. Likely multifactorial including decrease
gastric mobility from MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10964**] overdose vs pyelonephritis.
Has tried multiple antiemetics but has found that most relieving
regimen is phenergan with ativan prn.

7.	Weight loss.  Patient reports 81b weight loss over last 2
years, attributed to decreased appetite s/p pituitary resection.
 Also concerning for neoplasm or eating disorders ?????? anorexia or
bulemia. Given inability to tolerate POs, PICC line was placed
on [**4-2**] and pt was started on TPN. Nutrition followed pt
throughout hospitalization. Pt tolerating PO liquid, but very
slow to tolerate soft diet. She has tolerated custards and
italian ice and jello and is slowly starting to tolerate soups.
Will continue to SLOWLY advance diet on discharge.  Began
cycling TPN on [**4-13**] and she is now receiving TPN 12 hours
overnight. On discharge, she will continue overnight TPN cycling
for 12 hours. Heparin can be stopped as she is ambulatory. Will
have weekly labs drawn and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] nutrionist/TPN group
who will adjust TPN additives as necessary. Will also wean off
TPN as tolerated.

8.  Hypotension: pt with baseline SBP in 100's but [**Month (only) **] to 80-90s
during admission; min response to fluid bolus - unclear etiology
- hct stable despite UGI bleed earlier during admit. Likely
multifactorial including her h/o autonomic dysfunction vs [**Month (only) **]
fluid volume from [**Month (only) **] PO intake/HGT suction vs SE of pain meds.
She was completely asymptomatic with SBPs in 90s.

9.	Tobacco use.  Patient has a 19 pack-year smoking history.
She was continued on Nicotine 14 mg TD daily. DIscussed smoking
cessation with pt who feels that this hospitalization may be the
beginning of her smoking cessation. WIll cont the patch on d/c
and discussed with pt that she cannot smoke while wearing the
patch.

Prior to discharge, discussed all of the above
events/complications with Ms. [**Known lastname 61333**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3390**]. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will see her in
clinic the day after discharge and will follow her progress
closely.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2103-10-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Hyperdense products in the area of prior subdural
hemorrhages is
consistent with new hemorrhage.
2.  A significant interval increase in midline shift, with
significant
effacement of the left lateral ventricle as well as the right
ambient cistern. No complete effacement of the basal cistern to
suggest, uncal herniation.
3.  Asymetry and possible herniation of the brain tissue through
the burr
hole.
4.  Hyperdense blood products along the posterior aspect of the
falx and the tentorium likely represent redistribution of
subdural hemorrhage.

Head CT [**2103-10-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Slight increase in left to right midline shift with increase
in caliber of right lateral ventricle and left uncal herniation.
Identical distribution of high-density components of the left
frontal subdural hematoma possibly indicating organization or
recent hemorrhage.

2.  Stable blood products layering along the tentorium and falx.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2103-10-17**]
1. Status post evacuation with placement of drain and
near-complete resolution of subdural hematoma, with only minimal
pneumocephalus and residual mixed-density fluid collection.
2. Improved rightward shift of midline structures and left uncal
herniation.
3. Blood products layering along the tentorial leaflets, left
more than right, and the falx, as before.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2103-10-18**]
1.  Stable left frontal subdural hematoma and blood products in

with relief. She tolerated a diet without issue. She was
transferred to the floor. Surgical intervention was postponed
given her stable neurological exam and we discussed elective
surgery vs. continuing to watch the SDH. On [**10-16**], patient's
symptoms progressed and head CT showed reacummulation of L SDH,
she was taken to the OR for L burr holes for evacuation.
Intraoperatively, no complications occurred, a subdural drain
was placed and post operatively, patient was transferred to the
ICU for close monitoring. On [**10-17**], post op head CT showed
re-expansion of the brain. She remained stable on examination
and was transferred to the floor.

On [**10-18**], patient reported increase in headaches, not relieved
with fiorcet. Her pain medication was increased and a repeat
head CT was ordered for re-evaluation. Head CT was stable. Her
subdural drain was removed and staples were placed at the drain
site. On [**10-19**], patient remained in stable condition, sutures
from first procedure were removed. She was ambulating
appropriately and eating adequately. She was discharged home.

Chief Complaint:
Anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] is a 20 year-old female with history of
relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis who presented to [**Hospital1 1535**] Emergency Department on [**2107-11-20**]
with left flank pain.  She describes her pain as ""achy""
discomfort which began approximately 10 days prior to admission,
wrapping around to her lower back, worse with movement, slightly
better with ibuprofen.  She also notes that the discomfort is
worse with urination, mainly a ""pressure"" on the left side.  She
denies associated hematuria/dysuria.  She denies
N/V/diarrhea/abdominal pain/blood in stool/tarry colored stool.
She also reports left hip pain which developed over the same
time period for which she was seen by her PCP earlier this past
week and was diagnosed with probable bursitis.  She reports that
the flank pain has progressively worsened over the past 10 days
so that her mother who works in the SICU at [**Hospital1 18**] referred her
to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.5  P 85  BP 102/66  RR 16
O2sat 100% RA.  CBC, chemistries, and LFTs were normal and UA
was negative.  She received 1mg IV morphine x2.  Plan was made
for CT abdomen/pelvis to assess for possible kidney stone; if
stone was not present, then plan was to proceed with
administration of IV contrast to further assess for other
etiologies of her left flank pain.

After initial scan failed to demonstrate kidney stone, IV
contrast was administered.  Within approximately one minute of
receiving IV contrast she reports feeling chest heaviness and
difficulty breathing.  She also reports that her face became
swollen, she itched all over and that her throat was itchy.  She
shouted ""I can't breathe"" while in the CT scanner and was
immediately removed from the scanner.  She was treated
emergently for presumed life-threatening anaphylactoid reaction
to IV contrast; in this setting, she received 1 mL of 1:1000
epinephrine (1 mg) intravenously.  She was then transferred back
to the Emergency Department and treated with solumedrol,
famotidine, benadryl, and bronchodilator nebulizers.  She was
tachycardic to the 120s and hypotensive to systolic pressure in
the 70's, and received intravenous fluid resuscitation with 4
liters of normal saline. She then developed hypoxia and cough
with frothy pink sputum, requiring supplemental oxygen by
non-rebreather mask.  EKG was notable for ischemic ST
depressions in the inferolateral leads.  Her cardiac enzymes
(normal on presentation) were elevated (troponin of 0.43) when
measured after the anaphylaxis episode/epinephrine dose,
consistent with acute cardiac injury.  She was then transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for further evaluation
and treatment.

She was admitted to the MICU on [**2107-11-21**].  She was treated for
acute lung injury/pulmonary edema, volume-responsive shock, and
acute myocardial injury ultimately attributed to her
anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast and subsequent
administration of 1 mg IV epinephrine at 1:1000 concentration
(note the standard dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is 0.3 mg
SC/IM at 1:1000 concentration).  Echocardiogram on [**2107-11-22**]
demonstrated essentially normal cardiac function.  Ms [**Known lastname 22473**]
noted the presence of continous substernal chest discomfort;
further evaluation did not demonstrate EKG or enzyme evidence of
ongoing cardiac injury.  Her respiratory status and blood
pressure improved with supportive care, and she was transferred
from the MICU to the medical floor on [**2107-11-22**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] is a 20 year-old female with history of multiple
sclerosis who presented to the ED with L flank pain and suffered
severe anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast with acute hypoxia
and hypotension while undergoing CT scan; in this setting she
received 1 mg 1:1000 IV epinephrine and developed acute lung
injury/pulmonary edema and acute myocardial injury for which she
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as described
above.  She was subsequently transferred to the medical floor on
[**2107-11-22**].

Once transferred to the medical floor, her supplemental oxygen
was progressively weaned off.  Despite persistent symptoms of
central chest discomfort following her anaphylactoid event,
EKG/enzymes failed to demonstrate ongoing/residual cardiac
injury.  Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] noted post-prandial nausea/vomiting for
several days s/p her ICU stay.  She was treated with compazine
and zofran with minimal relief.  With ongoing symptoms, she
received a second dose of compazine on [**11-27**]; approximately four
hours later, the patient developed facial contortion and left
hand spasm felt likely to represent an acute dystonic reaction
to the compazine.  She was treated with benadryl, cogentin, and
valium.  After approximately 8-12 hours, her left hand spasm
resolved, however Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] remained unable to open her jaw from
a closed position despite repeated dosing of benadryl, cogentin,
and valium.  She was seen by the Neurology Consult Service and
also by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] from Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery.  Although
initially unable to speak because of concurrent inability to
move her tongue, after two days her tongue ""loosened"" and she
was able to communicate verbally despite persistent jaw closure.
 It was uncertain whether her inability to open the jaw
represented trismus vs alternate complication of her dystonic
reaction.  Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] was observed during sleep with persistent
closed jaw, arguing against conversion disorder.  She was
maintained on IV fluid hydration and liquid diet by straw.
Consideration was given to administration of nerve block to
facilitate mechanical manipulation to open the jaw, however on
[**12-1**] her jaw was released from the closed position after 10 mg
IV valium and mechanical manipulation by her mother - once
released, Ms [**Name (NI) 22473**] was able to independently open/close her jaw,
eat, and speak without need for further mechanical intervention.

In terms of Ms [**Known lastname 48849**] original complaint of left flank pain,
Neurology Consult service felt that this most likely represented
a thoracic radiculopathy related to a herniated disc.  Her
symptoms persisted, in waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] intensity, throughout her
hospital course.

On [**12-4**], Ms [**Known lastname 22473**] notice that her right foot was ""turning in""
(ankle inversion) when she walked; she notes that this is a
finding she relates to prior flares of her multiple sclerosis.
She also noted ""clumsiness"" of her right hand, most noticeable
in her hand-writing which has become less legible, as well as
right eye ""blurry vision"".  A head MRI was obtained which
demonstrated new multiple sclerosis disease activity.  Upon
consultation with Ms [**Known lastname 48849**] primary neurologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**], her
scheduled Tysabri dose was postponed and she was treated with a
3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of
250mg every 6 hours.  Her next scheduled Tysabri dose was
arranged for [**2107-12-12**].

Repeat echocardiogram [**2107-12-9**] demonstrated essentially normal
cardiac function, without evidence of pericardial effusion or
focal wall motion abnormality.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
1. Anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast
2. Epinephrine overdose.
3. Acute lung injury.
4. Acute myocardial (heart) injury
4. Acute dystonic reaction and prolonged trismus (lock jaw)to
prochlorperazine (compazine)
5. Left flank pain, likely secondary to thoracic disc herniation
6. Multiple sclerosis, relapsing-remitting, with acute flare


Discharge Condition:
Heart and lung exams have returned to [**Location 213**].  Face, jaw, and
hand spasms, resulting from an adverse reaction to compazine,
have resolved.  You are being discharged in stable condition,
but need close follow-up as an outpatient to ensure full
recovery from your complex hospital course.

Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated in the Emergency Department for left-sided
flank pain. You had an abdominal CT scan to evaluate this pain,
and had a severe allergic ""anaphylactoid"" reaction to the
intravenous contrast used for the CT.  You were given a high
dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids, famotadine, benadryl,
and intravenous fluids for treatment of this reaction. The
severe allergic reaction and high dose of epinephrine resulted
in injury to your heart and lungs. You were admitted and treated
for this reaction in the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days, and
once stable, transferred to the medicine floor.

You also developed a facial contortion and locked jaw (a
dystonic reaction) in response to a medication you took for
nausea, called Compazine.  This resolved initially with
medications, except your jaw remained locked for 4 days. You
recieved benadryl, benztropine (Cogentin), and Valium.  Higher
doses of valium in addition to manual manipulation of your jaw
was required to finally open the jaw.

You developed symptoms of right foot inversion, right hand
clumsiness, and right eye ""blurring"".  An MRI of your head was
consistent with an active multiple sclerosis flare.  You were
treated with high-dose steroids for three days, with mild
improvement.

Please remain at home for 1 week following discharge for further
monitoring, given the recent complicated hospital course
involving anaphylactic reaction, myocardial injury, acute lung
injury, and acute dystonic reaction.

Your back pain is likely from a bulging disc in your spine. You
can treat this with pain medication for now, and if it does not
resolve in [**1-17**] weeks, please see your primary care physician to
follow it up.

Please note that you are allergic to IV contrast, and had a
dystonic reaction to Compazine. These have been added to your
allergy list.

Please return to the ED or call your primary care physician if
you have symptoms similar to those you had in the CT scanner -
throat tightness, ichiness, or any other concerning symptoms.
Please do the same if your jaw locks again.

Followup Instructions:
You have been scheduled for Tysabri infusion at the pheresis
unit on at Monday [**2107-12-12**] at 2:15 PM.  If you have any further
questions, please contact your neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8760**],
at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11088**] to schedule Tysabri infusion.

Please f/u with your primary care doctor in the next 1-2 weeks
to follow up on the multiple issues described above.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 31 yo woman with h/o asthma, recent dx MS, [**Doctor First Name 919**]
syndrome, [**Last Name (un) 52372**] [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome who presented to ED with CC of
cough/wheezing.  Pt states she was in her USOH until
approximately 5 days ago when developed increased wheezing, and
felt as though her asthma was flaring up.  She had run out of
her outpt advair at this time, and the pharmacy could not get it
for awhile, so she was not taking it over the past 5 days.  Over
the next couple of days, she continued to have SOB/wheezing, due
to her asthma, and then over the past 1-2 days developed
non-productive cough, mild rhinorrhea, chills, did not take temp
at home.  Also on night PTA, had onset of hives on her face and
tongue swelling, which she describes as similar to previous
allergic rxns to foods, but denies eating any new foods or foods
that she knows she has an allergy to.  Did eat from take-out on
friday night, but these sxs occurred saturday night.  Pt
otherwise denied any CP/pressure, heart palpitations, N/V, sore
throat, body aches.  States that her children and husband were
just sick with a viral URI.
To self treat her wheezing, cough at home, she states she has
been taking increased amounts of her home albuterol inhaler and
nebulizer treatment over past couple days to treat asthma and
compensate for no advair.  Notabley did albuterol neb treatment
on friday night, saturday night, and sunday morning prior to
presentation to ED.
In ED, initially felt asthma exacerbation and was given
prednisone 60mg PO x 1, levofloxacin 250mg x 1, along with
albuterol + atrovent nebulizer treatments.  CXR negative for
pneumonia.  Upon re-evaluation, pt was noted to be tachycardic
to 120's-130's, T 102, other VSS.  Labs notable for HCO3 19, AG
16, lactate 3.5.  EKG with diffusely flipped t waves, so concern
for pericarditis.  However, bedside U/S demonstrated no evidence
of pericardial effusion and pt CP free.  D dimer checked and was
nl.  Noted to be tremulous and have hyperreflexia on exam, so
concern for thyroid storm.  TSH sent, pending upon transfer to
MICU.  Endocrinology contact[**Name (NI) **] and aware of pt.  Pt given PTU
150mg x 1, hydroxyzine 25mg x 1, esmolol gtt.
Currently pt w/ continued cough, wheezing, but feels ""ok"".


Past Medical History:
- [**Doctor First Name 919**] syndrome: DS is a miswiring of the eye muscles that
causes some eye muscles to contract when they should not and
other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Often, when
the eye moves toward the nose, the eyeball also pulls into the
socket (ie, retraction), the eye opening narrows.
- [**Last Name (un) 52372**] [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome: This autosomal dominant condition can
be
quite variable within families. The characteristics include lack
of an opening for the anus which must be repaired at birth,
abnormal bones of the hands or feet, kidney problems (usually
small, poorly formed kidneys), ""lop"" shaped ears, and mild
sensorineural hearing loss.  Single gene disorder (SALLI gene

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-3-4**] 7:18 AM
SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: There are no focal areas of consolidation,
pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or infiltration. Pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits without evidence of
interstitial edema. Hilar contours are normal without evidence
of hilar adenopathy. The cardiomediastinal contour is unusual
despite absence of gastric distension as present on previous
study. Similar unusual configuration of the cardiomediastinal
contour was also noted on [**2137-8-21**] and has since been
unchanged. There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.

IMPRESSION: Unusual cardiac contour unchanged since [**2137-8-21**].
No pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.

Echo [**3-3**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2137**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2138-3-3**] 3:43 PM

IMPRESSIONS:

1. Lower lobe and lingular subsegmental atelectasis, without
evidence of pulmonary embolus.

2. Incidentally noted duplicated superior vena cava.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Pt is a 31 yo woman w/ h/o asthma, recently dx
MS who p/w asthma exacerbation, fevers, tachycardia w/ initial
concern for thyroid storm, but TFTs nl.
.
# Hypoxia/resp status:  Pt presented w/ c/o ""asthma
exacerbation"" w/ noted wheezing on initial exam.  Evaluated w/
CXR which was unremarkable.  However, after o/n treatment w/
nebulizer treatments and steroids, pt with increased vs
decreased O2 requirement.  CTA chest was done to r/o PE (even
though d dimer < 500), neg for PE or parenchymal consolidation.
DFA done on [**3-3**] returned positive for influenza.  Plan to:
- steroid burst - pred 60mg x 5 days (started [**3-2**])
- albuterol nebs PRN
- continue outpt advair
- continue tamiflu x 5 days (started [**3-3**])
- continue azithro x 5 days (started [**3-2**])
The patient was transferred to the floor with quick improvement
of her respiratory status. She did not require nebs the last 24
hours of her hospital stay, and sats were normal and stable upon
discharge.
.
# Elevated lactate/AG acidosis:  Pt w/ elevated lactate 3.5 in
ED, rechecked, and elevated to 4.5.  Also w/ noted decreased
HCO3 to 19, with AG 16 on admission.  Pt appeared to be well
perfused, nl renal fxn, nl LFTs.  Received IVF.  Concern for
influenza given prior presentations for increased lactate.  As
above, DFA positive.  Plan to:
- mangagement as above
- moniter HCO3
The patient's anion gap acidosis resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Fever:  Presumabley [**2-22**] flu.  Afebrile here.

# Sinus tachycardia:  Initially felt due to possible thyroid
storm, maintained on esmolol gtt.  Now TFTs returned nl, esmolol
gtt d/ced.  PE r/o w/ CTA chest.  ECHO unremarkable for etiology
of tachycardia.  Now resolving w/ treatment of resp status.  Pt
had a stable HR around 90 upon discharge, which has been
attributed to her virus and albuterol treatments. She was chest
pain free and without pleuritic pain or shortness of breath/DOE
at discharge and will follow up with her PCP regarding this.

# H/O MS:  Not on any meds. No sx while here.
.
# Depression: Continue effexor. No Sx while here.

Pt remained stable while on the floor without any issues. She
took good PO and remained on appropriate prophylaxis throughout
her hospital stay. She was discharged in good condition with
prescriptions to complete tamiflu, prednisone and Advair tx. She
was sent with masks and instructions to wear x 4 more days.

She was advised to discard breastmilk for two days while she is
on tamiflu.

Brief Hospital Course:
55M with MS, diabetes and untreated prostate cancer presents
from [**Hospital1 1501**] w/ fever/AMS and possible PNA admitted to the MICU for
concern for evolving sepsis, with hypernatremia and concern for
likely repeated aspiration pneumonias.
.
#Sepsis, Pneumonia: Met 3 sirs criteria with fever, tachycardia,
and elevated WBC count at time of admission. PNA seen on chest
CT. Treated with vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin for HCAP since
he lives in a nursing facility and has recently received
antibiotics. His urine legionella was neative so the
levofloxacin was discontinued. His fever, tachycardia and
elevated WBC count resolved. He was not able to produce a sputum
sample so he was continued on vanc/zosyn for a planned 7 day
course, started [**4-30**], completed [**5-6**]. He did have a fever to 100.8
on the day following discontinuation of abx, but remained
afebrile since. He also developed a leukocytosis on the day
prior to discharge, which was up to 11 and stayed stable on day
of discharge. The patient had repeat AP and Lat CXR to evaluate
for pna, which showed LLL pna, but this is consistent with prior
known pna and felt to likely represent no new process.
.
# Goals of Care: the patient developed hypernatremia to 148,
which resolved with free water IVF. This is likely secondary to
decrease in free water PO given change in speech and swallow
recommendations to take nectar thick liquids. The possibility of
PEG was raised with the family, which would ensure adequate
hydration and avoid hypernatremia and renal failure. [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **], HCP and patient's sister, as well as his mother, felt
strongly on repeated occasions that PEG is not what [**Known firstname **]
would desire. They choose to continue to administer free water
by mouth despite risk of aspiration. They understand that
continued administration of water will likely lead to repeated
pneumonias, and that he may not be able to meet his needs for
free water, and hypernatremia or pneumonia could lead to death.
They also desire to avoid repeated courses of antibiotics. The
possibility of ""do not rehospitalize, do not escalate care"" was
broached, but it was NOT agreed upon. The family, at this point,
do continue to desire antibiotics, IVF and hospitalization if
indicated.
.
# Hypernatremia: up to 148, improved with free water by IVF.
Please see discussion of goals of care above.
.
#Multiple sclerosis: His clinical condition has continued to
decline, particularly over the past three years. Because of his
frequent PNAs and risk for aspiration he was evaluated by speech
and swallow. After a video swallow study he was started on
nectar thick liquids and full solids. Please see discussion of
goals of care, above.
.
#Anemia: He presented with a hematocrit >40 but decreased to
32.9. Hemolysis labs were negative and his stools were guaiac
negative. His HCT stayed stable around 33 and was felt to be
likely related to draws from his PICC not being adequately
flushed and phlebotomy. He remained hemodynamically stable and
did not require transfusion.
.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: His creatinine was 0.6 on admission then increased to 1.5.
Review of prior records showed that his baseline is actually
closer to 0.9. He was given IVF since his PO intake was poor.
His Cr trended to 1.1 at time of discharge. This is likely
secondary to pre-renal etiology.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES
.
#Diabetes type 2. On metformin at home. Insulin sliding scale
was started on admission and he was transitioned back to
metformin on discharge.
.
#Prostate cancer: Elevated PSA to 11.4 in [**3-23**]. Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sudden right sided hemiparesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 29 year old,
right handed man with a history of migraines who was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] in early [**2107-3-19**] with the sudden onset of right hemiparesis.  Workup at
that time suggested possible stroke in the left pons,
although other lesions were also revealed in the white matter
of both hemispheres.  The patient improved well with physical
therapy and was discharged on Aggrenox and Lipitor on [**2107-3-24**].  According to his wife, the patient did quite well for
one week after release from the neurology service.  He was
able to walk with a walker.  His rapid alternating movements
had improved and his talking was almost 90 percent normal.
Then on Wednesday, [**3-30**], at 9:30 p.m. the patient had the
sudden onset of left face and lip numbness, facial swelling
and felt that there was a lot of pressure behind the left
eye.  He tried to sleep, but could not.  By midnight the
pressure behind the eye was so bad that he thought his eye
was going to [**Doctor Last Name **] out.  His wife called [**Hospital1 190**] around 11:00 p.m. who advised that the
symptoms were most likely due to migraines and that the
patient should receive Imitrex.  This was done and the
patient fell asleep.  The morning after the patient had
worsening face swelling and he was dizzy with several
vomiting episodes every time he attempted to ingest food.  He
was so weak that he could not walk.  He was rolled into his
PCP's office in a wheelchair who contact[**Name (NI) **] his primary
neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**], who was covered by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
He was instructed to discontinue Aggrenox since the facial
swelling was thought to be more of a side effect of this and
he was started on Plavix on the day after.  The following day
the patient had worsening of all his symptoms except for the
swelling of his face.  He was also having difficulty taking
breaths as he had swelling in his airway, although he was not
wheezing.  His wife noticed that the patient had frothy
saliva all the time.  His weakness had now generalized.  He
was now somnolent most of the time.  Emergency medical
services were contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 5363**].  He was admitted to the intensive care unit there
at which point a head CT was done which was negative.  MRI
was done which showed hypodense lesions on the T1 images in
the caudate white matter and bilateral pons.  Lumbar puncture
was done which showed an opening pressure of 15, CSF white
blood cell count 18, 1 red blood cell, CSF glucose 65, CSF
protein 70.  HIV antibody was sent which was negative.  Lyme
serology was negative as well as skin test for TB.  On the
first day of admission there at [**Hospital3 **] he started
developing diplopia and eye movement problems and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for headache, nausea, vomiting,
weakness, problems with swallowing, mood changes, depression,
insomnia, somnolence, weight change, loss of appetite, fever,
chills, breathing problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for cluster migraines.
Approximately 10 years ago he had episode of left face and
right body numbness that lasted six months.  He was initially
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] and believed to be a stroke.  There
was no history of blurry vision, diplopia or myelitis signs.
In hindsight, there was a period approximately one to two
years where the patient had several days of right arm
tingling, but no weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Aggrenox which was discontinued on the
Wednesday prior to this admission and Lipitor which was
discontinued on the Wednesday prior to this admission.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and possible allergy to Aggrenox.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **]
works as a metal tool worker.  He denies smoking, alcohol or
drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for father with seizure disorder,
niece with infantile spasms.  Mother and two sisters have no
neurologic symptoms.  There is no family history of stroke or
migraines or multiple sclerosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient was
afebrile.  Vitals were 113/84, heart rate in the 60s and
regular sinus rhythm, breathing 16 to 20 and sating 96
percent in room air.  He had no apneustic or [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
breathing.  He was in no acute distress.  He had a supple
neck, no meningismus, no thyromegaly.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Heart was regular rate with no murmurs.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender.  Face was red and
slightly swollen.  On neurologic exam he was alert, oriented
to place, date and person.  He was not able to vocalize, but
he was able to communicate with signs and nodding ""yes"" and
""no.""  Attention was difficult to test, but he seemed to be
attentive based on the fact that he followed nonsimple
commands.  He could barely say ""ahh.""  He could not
differentially say ""ca"" or ""pa.""  Comprehension was intact
for simple and nonsimple commands.  He was able to barely
write on a piece of paper, but this was limited by weakness.
He had no difficulty calculating 2 times 4 or 10 minus 3.
There were no frontal release signs.  Visual fields were
full, although he had biocular diplopia in all directions.
Funduscopic exam was difficult secondary to the patient's
nystagmus.  There was no papilledema.  Pupils were equal and
round.  Eyes were midline.  He had bilateral sixth nerve
palsy.  On right lateral gaze his nystagmus was more
prominent.  He was not able to close his left eye completely.
Facial sensation was asymmetric.  He had decreased sensation
to pin prick, temperature and light touch on the left to V1,
V2, V3 distributions.  He had facial diplegia.  He was only
barely able to stick his tongue out and it had slight
deviation to the left.  Shoulder shrug was [**3-23**].  Head
movement to the left and right was also [**3-23**].  On motor exam
there was no atrophy or asymmetry.  He had increased tone in
the right upper extremity and right lower extremity.
Difficult to test for pronator drift.  He was able to lift
his left arm and leg, but could not sustain them longer than
five to seven seconds.  Weakness on the left was mostly
proximal in the deltoid.  Wrist extensors and finger
extensors were approximately 4+.  He was able to show two
fingers on his left hand.  On the left lower extremity he had
good power [**2-21**] to 4-/5.  On the right upper extremity he had
4- of the deltoid, triceps and [**1-21**] on the wrist extensors and
finger extensors.  The leg could not be tested.  He had no
resting tremor.  Finger-nose-finger was grossly abnormal on
the left, but could not perform on the right secondary to
weakness.  He had reflexes that were brisk and increased
throughout, although on the right they were much more brisk
and his toes were upgoing bilaterally.  Sensation in the
trunk and legs was intact and symmetric to fine touch, pin
prick, temperature.  We were not able to test gait.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 29 year old man with
a history of recent hemiparesis with MRI findings suggestive
of a demyelinating disease.  He was started on IV Solu-Medrol
and initially started on heparin IV which was discontinued
after hospital day one here at [**Hospital1 188**].  He was continued on five days of IV Solu-Medrol and
then switched to prednisone 60 mg q.day.  During this time he
was able to show some mild improvement in that he was able to
have better movement of his oral movements, although he could
not completely open his mouth.  His left arm weakened to the
point of almost [**11-22**] to [**12-23**] activity throughout, but on the
day of discharge he had more [**1-21**] to 4/5 strength throughout.

The patient's laboratory studies on the day of discharge
showed white blood cell count 16.8, hematocrit 40, platelets
253.  Coags showed PT 13.8, PTT 26, INR 1.3.  Electrolytes
were sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarbonate 31,
BUN 22, creatinine 0.6, glucose 115.  Calcium 8.8, recent
ionized calcium 1.11, magnesium 2.3, phosphate 4.4.  Most
recent LFTs were on [**4-2**] and showed ALT 23, AST 20,
alkaline phosphatase 64, total bilirubin 0.5.  Last ABG
showed 7.43, 48, 98 percent on 3 liters O2 nasal cannula.
Laboratory studies showed chest x-ray on [**4-5**] which showed no
CHF or pulmonary edema and signs of pneumonia or focal
infiltrate.  CSF studies from the outside hospital at [**Hospital3 5363**] showed that he was positive for oligoclonal bands.
CSF for myelin basic protein was still pending at the time of
discharge.  The phone number to contact for followup of the
study is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44642**].  Studies here at [**Hospital1 190**] showed that he had HIV antibody that was
negative.  Lyme serology was also negative.  CSF cytology was
pending.  CSF EBV PCR was pending.  CSF viral culture was
pending.

The patient was discharged in good condition to [**Hospital1 **] rehab facility.  His discharge medications are as
follows.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Pantoprazole 40 mg NG tube q.day.
2. Sliding scale insulin.
3. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. for DVT
   prophylaxis.
4. Zoloft 75 mg q.day.
5. Diazepam 10 mg b.i.d. and 10 mg q.four hours p.r.n. for
   anxiety.
6. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Bisacodyl q.day.

The patient's feeds are Impact with fiber 80 cc per hour via
a Dobbhoff tube which was placed on [**2107-4-7**].

PLAN:
1. Neurologic.  The patient will continue prednisone 60 mg
   p.o. q.day beginning on [**2107-4-8**].  He will continue
   this for five days and then decrease to 40 mg p.o. q.day
   at which dose he will remain.  CSF results from the
   outside hospital, [**Hospital3 **], need to be followed up.
   This number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44642**] and the study is for CSF
   myelin basic protein as well as from [**Hospital1 5630**] he needs CSF studies for cytology, EBV PCR
   and viral cultures that are pending.  He will continue
   with physical therapy and occupational therapy.  He has a
   followup appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 8760**] at [**Hospital1 20311**] in multiple sclerosis clinic on
   [**2107-4-15**], at 9:00 a.m., which is located on the eighth
   floor of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  He will need
   transportation provided to make that visit.  He also has a
   followup appointment with his primary neurologist, Dr.
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1692**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1693**], on [**2107-5-5**], at 8:30 a.m.  This is also
   located at [**Hospital1 69**] on the
   eighth floor of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  At some point in
   the future he will also need an MRI of his spine,
   preferably the whole spine, but if not, at least the C-
   spine to evaluate if he has further lesions.  At [**Hospital **] clinic
   he will be evaluated and possibly the addition of
   interferon or prophylactic medicines will be determined as
   well as the length of his prednisone dose and course will
   be figured out.  Importantly, his head must be at 45
   degrees or above at all times.

1. Cardiovascular.  The patient is stable.  His blood
   pressure was mildly elevated at 130 to 150.  However, this
   is most likely due to steroids and will only be followed
   at this moment.

1. Respiratory.  Goal O2 sats are greater than 93 percent.
   He needs frequent chest P.T. and frequent suctioning of
   his oropharynx.  He needs to be kept upright and
   aspiration precautions must be taken at all times.  His
   CO2 was mildly elevated at 48.  He may benefit from CPAP
   or BiPAP at night.

1. GI.  The patient will continue pantoprazole q.day for
   ulcer prophylaxis.  He will continue Colace and Dulcolax
   for constipation.  He will continue Dobbhoff and G tube
   feeds of Impact with fiber at 80 cc per hour which is his
   goal.

1. Renal.  The patient is stable.  BUN and creatinine were 26
   and 0.6.

1. Psychologic.  We will continue Zoloft 75 mg per day.  We
   will continue Valium 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. and 10 mg p.r.n.
   q.four hours for anxiety and depression with a goal of
   eventually tapering his Valium.

1. Hematologic.  The patient is stable with hematocrit of 40
   percent.  He is on heparin 5000 units subcu b.i.d. for DVT
   prophylaxis.  He is also on sliding scale insulin for
   blood sugars since he is on steroids, which will
   eventually be weaned once he is off steroids.

1. Code status.  The patient is a full code.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling, dizziness, diplopia, speech
problems and fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old right-
handed male with multiple sclerosis who presents with
tingling, dizziness, diplopia, speech problems and fatigue.
Two days ago, the patient noted that his right arm was weak.
His right fingers started tingling up to the elbow and his
left fingers also started to tingle.  Then he noted that his
mouth and tongue were tingling.  Yesterday, the patient had
vertigo that was much worse with standing and moving his
head.  He also noted diplopia which was worse with staring to
the left and with far vision.  He also noted his speech was
quite slurred.  Today he noticed his mouth and neck were
swollen.  During these days he has had fatigue and anorexia.

On review of systems the patient denies any fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, headache, neck pain, hearing changes, chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria,
hematuria, diarrhea, bright red blood per rectum or
bowel/bladder problems.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Migraine; 2.  Without pain, multiple sclerosis.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister with hypothyroidism, mother with
migraine and hypothyroidism, father with generalized
tonoclonic seizure since childhood, on Trileptal.  There is
no family history of multiple sclerosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a disabled tool maker and is married
with one child.  He lives at home with his pregnant wife,
prior to being in the rehabilitation center.  He denies
tobacco, drug or alcohol use.

MEDICATIONS:  Medications at the rehabilitation center were
valium 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Senna
prn, Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d., Methotrexate 12.5 mg p.o. q.
week, Zoloft 75 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed
temperature 99.2, pulse 89, blood pressure 122/79,
respiratory rate 29, 96 percent on room air.  Generally, a
pleasant man in moderate discomfort.  Neck is supple without
Lhermitte sign.  Heart has regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities showed
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

On neurologic examination he is awake, alert and cooperative
to examination.  He is oriented times three and is able to do
the months of the year backwards.  He is recall 3 out of 3
after 30 seconds and 5 minutes.  His language is fluent with
good comprehension and repetition.  His naming is intact.  He
has significant dysarthria.  He has no apraxia or neglect.
On cranial nerve examination his pupils are equally round and
reactive to light, 4 to 3 mm bilaterally.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  There is no relative afferent
pupillary defect or red desaturation.  He has a left sixth
nerve palsy with esotropia on primary gaze.  His facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  He has a right facial
droop.  His hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally.
Palate elevates symmetrically and tongue deviates to the
right without fasciculation.  Sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius are normal bilaterally.  On motor tone he has
normal tone in the upper extremities.  He has increased tone
in the lower extremities with a five beat clonus in the right
ankle.  There is also one beat clonus in the left ankle.
There is no tremor.  On the motor examination he had a right
deltoid that 4-/5.  He had wrist flexors and finger flexors,
adductors and abductors which were 4+/5.  His right biceps,
wrist extensor, hamstring, ankle extensor, toe extensors,
everters were 4 out of 5.  His iliopsoas was very weak at 2
out of 5 on the right and 4 out of 5 on the left.  On his
left side, his deltoid, triceps were 4 out of 5 with the rest
of the muscle group being 5 out of 5.  On sensory examination
he is intact to light touch, pinprick, cold temperature,
vibration and proprioception.  He is hyporeflexive throughout
and symmetric.  His toes are upgoing bilaterally.  On
coordination examination he has dysmetria on the finger-to-
nose test, right greater than left.  Gait was not assessed at
this time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's history and past
medical problems, it is likely that he has reexacerbation of
his multiple sclerosis and likely has new demyelinating
disease, likely in the thalamocapillar region to produce the
right-sided weakness and subjective sensory losses.  He may
also have effective pontocerebellar tracts which give him the
vertigo and the weakness.  Given this suspicion, an magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain was done which showed
enlarging focus of T2 hyperintensity involving the left
lateral plug and the left middle cerebellar peduncle which
demonstrates minor peripheral and central nodular enhancement
following gadolinium administrations.  The other T2
hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter and corpus
collasum were unchanged.  The patient was then started on
high dose intravenous steroids at this time, but within 24
hours, he worsened to the point that he had a dysphagia,
increasing diplopia and increasing right-sided weakness.  He
reported that neither his right arm or leg was antigravity.
At this point, it was decided in conjunction with his
multiple sclerosis doctor that he receives plasmapheresis in
addition to the intravenous steroids.  He did slowly improve
with these two treatment regimens.  The patient was also
continued on his Methotrexate.  It was later decided he
should be switched over to p.o. Cytoxan for adjunctive
therapy.  His complete blood count was checked one day prior
to discharge and his white count was stable at 23.1.

Infectious disease - The patient came in with a urinalysis
showing abundant [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he started on Fluconazole for a
[**First Name3 (LF) 23087**] infection.  A repeat urinalysis later showed no
evidence of [**First Name3 (LF) 23087**] but evidence of bacteria so he started on
three day Levaquin.  The patient also complained of ear pain
and otoscopic examination showed that there was some erythema
and swelling of the tympanic membrane.  It is likely that he
had otitis media so he was started on Zithromax.

Pulmonary, central apnea - On the first day of
plasmapheresis, the patient had an episode of tachypnea and
desaturation.  he was sent to the Intensive Care Unit for 24
hour observation.  It was felt that this was due to his
demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system so he was
monitored with a continuous pulse oximetry while on the
medical floor.  He no longer had any other problems with his
respiratory status as his treatment for multiple sclerosis
were in progress.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Multiple sclerosis.

Urinary tract infection.

Otitis media

Central apnea.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Cytoxan 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Zoloft 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with physical therapy.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] in
three weeks.

The patient is to follow up with his primary care doctor in
one week.

The patient is to have urinalysis repeated and a complete
blood count checked q. week and sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**].

History of Present Illness:
83 yo F w/ h/o MS w/ LE paraplegia, hyper-reflexive bladder w/
frequent UTIs, and gastroparesis who presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
with diagnosis of vaginal bleeding and sepsis with temperature
of T:104.8 BP:94/49 P:134 RR:43 98%2L WBC:19.1, lactate:5.9.
Code sepsis called, CVL placed, patient received Vancomycin 1gm
IV x1, and Ceftazidime 2gm IV x1. She also received Decadron
10mg IV x1 and was started on levophed for persistent
hypotension despite 3L NS. In the ED, patient had pelvic exam
noting no lacerations w/ some dried blood in vault. Foley placed
with gross blood in urine. FAST exam done given hypotension
which was negative. CT Head negative. Patient denied any CP,
SOB, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
.
Patient thought to have hemorrhagic cystitis & received
aggressive fluid hydration while in the unit and self DC'd her
CVL. She also received 1U PRBCs although Hct=34 upon admission.
She had her Levophed tapered and has been hemodynamically stable
off pressors. She has been found to have 4/4 bottles of E.coli
in her blood, and also found to have Urine culture positive for
E.coli. She is had had Vanc discontinued and is currently on
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, although has been afebrile for >24
hours.
.
Her working diagnosis is urosepsis secondary to hemorrhagic
cystitis. Patient not thought to have cardiogenic shock given
SvO2 of >70% and warm extremities. She is being followed by
Urology and is known to have a large hematoma in her bladder,
and it is felt that this warrants a malignancy workup that can
be completed as an outpatient.
.
She also suffered an NSTEMI with anteriorlateral ST depressions
(V5-6) & STE (V3) during this episode with Tn peak at 0.34
thought to be due to demand in the setting of hypotension and

Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53yo woman with PMH significant for seizure
disorder, brain injury, and ?atypical multiple sclerosis who
presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking. History
is obtained from her sister, [**Name (NI) 49852**] from [**Name (NI) **],
and from her primary neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. She lives in an
[**Hospital3 **], and was noted yesterday to have generalized
tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90
minutes. EMS gave her valium 5mg pr at the facility and brought
her to [**Hospital3 1196**]. She persisted with right sided
seizure activity there and was given valium 10mg and ativan 1mg,
as well as loaded with dilantin 1000mg. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU. Here she was given an additional valium 5mg x 2
and ativan 1mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and
right hand. Since the ativan, her facial twitching has
apparently improved, but she continues to have hand twitches.
She also had an EEG, which showed left sided slowing on
preliminary read.

Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder, possibly
from a history of traumatic brain injury (though per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had
a very mild injury) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra.
Since she has seen Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], she has had at least two episodes
of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure, as well as
some less significant seizures which are characterized by left
gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity. Her
dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control. He tried
adding lamictal, but this caused a rash. At the time of her last
visit ([**2140-2-17**]) Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had discussed the addition of a third
[**Doctor Last Name 360**], possibly zonegran (less likely topamax), to the dilantin
200mg [**Hospital1 **] and keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her sister had wanted to keep
the current course because she felt she was doing well where she
was living and did not want to upset that. However, she had
several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit, with 15.4 in
[**4-23**].5 in [**Month (only) **], and 3.[**8-19**]. Her sister reports that
the medication dose had been changed to 200mg qam and 100mg qpm
in [**Month (only) **], and a review of her [**Hospital1 **] records indicates that this may
have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred
speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9.

According to her sister, the patient has no short-term memory.
She has been living in an [**Hospital3 **] facility and
frequently calls her even right after she has left without
remembering her visit. The patient walks with a walker at
baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] also carries a diagnosis of ""atypical MS"", which she
brought with her to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. According to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], she has had
stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes.
She had an MRI in [**2139**] that showed multiple plaque-like lesions,
but these were entirely stable since [**2135**]. She is not undergoing
any treatment. Reportedly she has been evaluated at [**Hospital1 1774**],
[**Hospital1 **], and possibly [**Hospital1 112**]. She has not had an LP as far as Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] knows.

CXR [**8-29**]: No evidence for pneumonia. No change since prior study
of [**2140-8-25**].

CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is moderately severe, confluent
periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal
horns, posterior horns, and more superiorly, involving the
centra semiovale. These findings are unchanged from prior
studies, and may relate to the ""atypical"" demyelinating process,
suggested in the indication on the prior MRI; however, they are
non-specific. There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-
axial hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. The ventricles are mildly prominent, but are
unchanged from the prior study. There is no interval loss of
focal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest acute
infarction, though CT is not sensitive in the early stages. No
focal masses is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect; no significant
interval change from CT of [**2140-6-20**].
2) Diffuse, confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity,
which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process (as
suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI). The
markedly low-attenation (14-15 [**Doctor Last Name **]) centered within this process
suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation
(""black hole""), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis.
Generalized and marked callosal atrophy (on the MR) also suggest
advanced, irreversible disease.
3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study; if
clinically concerned, an MRI with gadolinium is recommended.

MRI: There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in
the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres,
suggesting demyelinating disease. As previously noted, there is
associated volume loss, thinning of the corpus callosum, and
slight widening of the ventricles.

On post-contrast images, there is a probably stable appearance
of a 5mm linear, focal area of enhancement in the left centrum
semiovale, of uncertain etiology. Also ehancing is 3mm linear
lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly, not seen on
the [**7-21**] MR, but that study was very motion- degraded. The
hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by
multiple sclerosis.

There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect. No changes in
the overall morphology of the brain are identified. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
The major vascular flow patterns are normal.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal
in the periventricular white matter, consistent with severe
demyelinating disease.
2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left
hippocampal cortex. This former lesion was evident on MR dating
back to [**2139-7-17**], though is more prominent at this time, likely
due to less motion degradation of the current scan. Etiology of
these enhancing lesions is uncertain, but could be atypical
manifestations of demyelination.

EEG:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent
bursts of
generalized theta and delta slowing. Facial twitching was
described by
the technologist and seen on the video. This is primarily
right-sided,
facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the
forehead or
eye. There were no clear EEG correlate.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower
on the
left side, and there were additional bursts of delta slowing
seen
broadly on the left side alone.
ABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much
faster
beta rhythm. They appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the
right at
times, though the background was disorganized and slow on both
sides for
much of the recording. It was of much lower voltage on the left.

HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of
generalized
slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage
dimunition, along
with some slowing of the background. The generalized and
background
features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy. The left sided
slowing
and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the
left
side, possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction. There is a
possibility
of a structural lesion on the left, but the encephalopathy
dominated the
overall picture. There were no clear epileptiform discharges. No
EEG
correlate was established for the facial twitching. The lack of
EEG
correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central
cause (and,
indeed, this appeared most likely based on the clinical and
video
observations).

Brief Hospital Course:
53yo woman with h/o seizure disorder, demyelinating disease, and
brain injury, presents with prolonged seizure, now unresponsive
with persistent twitching of right arm and face. This is most
consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the
left hemisphere, most likely the motor strip. In the past, her
seizures were on the left side, which implies that she now has a
new focus. It is possible that this is secondary to her
underlying demyelinating disease, but per report this has not
been very active. Other possibilities include infection,
including her UTI. It is likely that these seizures began due to
subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200mg/100mg.
Her seizure management is difficult, given the higher doses were
causing her to fall and slur her speech. Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
the addition of an alternate [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with the possibility of
tapering down the dilantin in the future, and he agreed that she
may benefit from zonegran. Cannot use lamictal or depakote due
to reactions. Topamax is another possibility, but not ideal in a
patient with preexisting cognitive deficits. She was started on
zonegran at 50mg daily with plans to increase by 50mg every
other week to a goal dose of 200mg/day; she was on 100mg daily
at discharge and should have her dose increased on [**9-12**] and
again on [**9-26**]. She was continued on keppra and dilantin with
trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed. Ativan was
used for breakthrough seizures (facial twitching). MRI/MRA
showed new temporal lesions, but it is unclear if these are the
cause or effect of her seizures. She will need to have a repeat
MRI in several months for further evaluation. LP was done and
had no changes to suggest a different etiology (ie negative
cytology and negative immunophenotyping). Oligoclonal bands were
not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory. She
will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when
trough is subtherapeutic.

2. atypical MS: discussed with her outpt neurologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13039**]
in [**Hospital1 1559**]); no current role for MS medications. MRI was
performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left
temporal lobe. She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the
centrum semiovale. LP was done to evaluate for malignancy, and
no malignant cells were seen. Immunotyping was negative as well
(per verbal report).  Unfortunately, oligoclonal bands could not
be sent from the CSF (lab sent CSF for other studies and there
was not enough left over for OCBs).  This was relayed to the
family ([**Doctor First Name 717**]).  Given that she does have new lesions on MRI, if
OCBs were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS, and
it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy.  This was
relayed to the family, and they will readdress this with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 13039**] (MS doctor).  The family is confident in any decision Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 13039**] would make re: therapy for her MS.

3. fevers on admission: Pt w/ positive U/A, treated with bactrim
x 3 days with defervescence.

4. depression: continue escitalopram; assess need to change
medication as an outpatient.

5. FEN: NGT was placed given her altered mental status, and she
has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation, but has improved.
This should be repeated in several days as her mental status
continues to clear.

STUDIES:
CT ABD [**2129-7-5**]:
1. Inflammatory wall thickening in 12 cm loop of proximal
transverse colon.
Differential diagnosis includes inflammatory, infectious, or
ischemic. No
focal abscess or fluid collection. Although there are scattered
colonic
diverticula this does not appear to be the source of this
problem.
2. Multiple liver cysts.
.
CXR [**2129-7-4**]:  Overall findings are suggestive of mild/early CHF.
Prominence of the left paratracheal stripe in the configuration
of aortic arch suggests unfolding. If a dissection is suspected
clinically, CT of the chest is warranted.
.
CXR [**2129-7-12**]:
Since [**2129-7-5**], right internal jugular catheter was removed.
Lungs are
clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. There is no pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# [**Year (4 digits) **]: Her [**Year (4 digits) **] was likely due to a combination
of urosepsis and tizanidine induced [**Year (4 digits) **].  There was
initial concern for GI bleed given strongly guaiac positive BM
in ED. However, pt with no further evidence of GI bleed and her
lactate was normal. She was treated broadly for infection with
Vanc/Zosyn given [**Year (4 digits) **] in setting of T>98 (considered
fever in MS patients) and leukocytosis. Urine cultures grew out
>100,000 pan-sensitive Enterococcus; also with 10,000-100,000
Strep viridans, and her antibiotics were narrowed to ampicillin.
She was also started on on midodrine due to concern for
autonomic dysfunction with MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4246**] and
midodrine was discontinued.  Her blood cx and c diff were all
negative. She was transferred to the medical floor and had
episodes of [**Last Name (Titles) **] to the high 70s and low 80s which were
responsive to fluid.  It was discovered to be tizanidine (in
combination with baclofen) induced [**Last Name (Titles) **] and her
tizanidine was decreased in dose from 8mg and tapered down to
2mg. She was told not to take tizanidine within 2 hours of your
baclofen or within one hour of lisinopril. Outpatient
antihypertensives were held and then lisinopril was later
restarted at a decreased dose of 5mg daily.  Her HCTZ was not
restarted prior to discharge.  Her amitriptyline dose was
decreased as well to prevent [**Last Name (Titles) **].

# GI Bleed: Per report, the patient had a BM in ED that was dark
and strongly guaiac positive.  That with the combination of
[**Last Name (Titles) **] was concerning for significant bleed.  Hct on
presentation was 30.  She reported a prior cscope 2 years prior
w/o abnormalities.  She had a negative NG lavage.  In the ICU
her SBP dropped to the 80s and she was transfused 1 unit.
Hemolysis labs were negative. She was started on levophed. An
A-line was placed. She was continued on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]. GI was
consulted and felt there was no need for emergent scope. Her Hct
remained stable for the rest of the admission with no further
bloody stools.  She did have a with proximal transverse colon
thickening that was thought to more consistent with ischemic
rather than infectious or inflammatory processs. Initial
hematochezia may have been secondary to mild bowel ischemia from
[**Hospital1 **] in a pt with low reserve.  She should have an
outpatient colonoscopy.
.
# Weakness/confusion: Given her complicated neurologic history,
her complaints of muscle weakness and confusion were likely due
to both her MS, UTI, and transient [**Hospital1 **]. Her TSH was low
but her T4 was normall. Provigil was held and her outpatient
neurologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed. She should follow up with
neurology as an outpatient.

# MS: Patient was continued on baclofen, amitriptilene,
copaxone, keppra, and tizanidine (at a decreased dose as
detailed above). She was transiently on midodrine as detailed
above.

# Renal failure: She initially presented with ARF which was
likely hypovolemic in the setting of [**Name (NI) **], UTI, and ?GI.
Her creatinine [**Name (NI) 4246**] with transfusion and fluids.

# Anion gap acidosis: She had a normal lactate with no evidence
of uremia. Her anion gap acidosis was likely secondary to
ketosis in setting of NPO status. This improved with IV fluids
and diet restarted.

# Hypothyroidism: TSH was low but T4 was normal. She was
continued on Synthroid.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Zocor.

# Prophylaxis: continued on home famotidine and heparin sc.

Discharge Condition:
Stable. Normotensive.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a urinary tract infection and decreased
blood pressure.  In the intensive care unit you required
pressors to maintain your blood pressure.  On the normal medical
floor your blood pressure dropped several times and it responded
to IV fluids.  We think your blood pressure dropped due to a
combination of tizanidine and baclofen.  We spaced out these
medications and we decreased your dose of tizanidine.  You
should not take tizanidine within 2 hours of your baclofen.
Please do not take your lisinopril within 1 hour of your
tizanidine. You were treated for a urinary track infection and
you have completed your course of treatment.  You also had a
decreased hematocrit and we do not know whether you had a bleed
in your GI tract but we do know that your hematocrit is stable
now.  You should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient. Please
talk to your primary care doctor about arranging this.
.
The following medications were started:
-miconazole powder for your rash
.
The following medications were stopped:
-hydrochlorothiazide is being temporarily stopped to ensure you
do not become hypotensive. Please discuss with your primary care
doctor when to restart this.
.
The following medications were changed in dose:
-Lisinopril was decreased to 5mg po daily to ensure you do not
become hypotensive. Please discuss with your primary care doctor
when to restart this.
-amirtiptyline was decreased to 5mg po daily to ensure you do
not become hypotensive.
-tizanidine was decreased to 2mg po TID
-aspirin was decreased to 81mg po daily
.
Please return to the hospital if you develop fatigue, dizziness,
lighteheadedness, pain with urination, blood in your urine,
diarrhea, blood in your stool, chest pain, shortness of breath,
or any new concerning symptom.

History of Present Illness:
44 year old male with history of multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with
UTI. He was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 45860**] for UTI
complicated by encephalopathy (somnolent, difficult to arouse).
Urine culture grew staph aureus; sensitivities were not back by
time of discharge. He improved on bactrim and discharged on 14
day course. However, sensitivities after discharge returned with
MRSA.
.
He was seen by his outpatient urologist (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**])....

.
In the ED, initial VS: 95.1 75 151/100 16 97%. He received 1g IV
vancomycin. Previously, he had had an erythematous skin reaction
on the arm that vancomycin had been infusing. No history of resp
distress on vancomycin. Per ED, he had no ostensible reaction
while receiving the vancomycin. Per wife, he appeared more red
than usual in face and upper chest. Urology was called (but did
not officially consult) and agreed with admission to medicine
with urology following.
.
Within minutes of arrival to the floor, patient began to have
active seizures. Per wife, he does not have history of seizures
and was conversing and at baseline mental status while in ED. He
began to groan, head moving side to side, upper extremities
twitching and outstretched. During the first episode, he had
oxygen desaturation briefly to the mid 70s on room air for a few
seconds. Blood pressure was in systolic 180s; HR in 110s. He
then fell into stupor and within a few minutes again became
tremulous in upper extremities. Pupils were not reactive to
light. He received a total of 10mg iv ativan. Neurology was
consulted who recommended 1g loading dose of iv fosphenytoin.
Wife confirmed that pt is [**Name (NI) 835**]/DNR.

Studies
EEG [**3-18**]: CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 12:05 on [**3-18**]
and continued until 7:O0 the next morning. At the beginning, it
showed a low voltage faster pattern in all areas with bursts of
focal slowing especially in the left temporal region. There were
also some runs of rhythmic 6 Hz slowing in the left temporal
area and other runs of periodic slowing with sharp features,
none lasting for more than 8-10 seconds or so. On video, they
did not appear to have any clinical correlate. By the
evening, the background was more suppressed and, while left
temporal
slowing was still evident, the sharp features were not. SPIKE
DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed a few of the left temporal sharp
features, especially early in the record. SEIZURE DETECTION
PROGRAMS: Showed no electrographic seizures. PUSHBUTTON
ACTIVATIONS: There were none. SLEEP: No normal waking or sleep
patterns were evident. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally
regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. There was continued focal slowing in the
left temporal region. Early in the record, this also included
some runs of irregular sharp activity and some 6 Hz rhythmic
slowing in the same area, but these episodes did not appear to
show any clinical evidence of seizure on video. They were brief.
No more prolonged and clear electrographic seizures were
recorded.

CXR [**2118-3-18**]: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung
volumes and worsening basilar atelectasis. The left PICC has
been removed. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured.

MR head [**2118-3-19**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with most
recent enhanced MR examination of [**2-/2118**], as well as the remote
study of [**2109-9-11**].
Again demonstrated is the extensive confluent
T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity
throughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white
matter, with similar abnormality involving the posterior fossa,
including the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar
hemispheres. Allowing for the motion artifact, above, the
overall appearance is unchanged. By and in-large, the extensive
lesions demonstrate intrinsic T1-hypointensity, representing
""black holes"" of irreversible demyelination. However, there is a
prominent curvilinear or ""targetoid"" 16 mm focus of enhancement
in the right corona radiata with a possible second enhancing
focus in the corresponding location on the left. The right-sided
focus appears new since the [**4-/2117**] examination, though
previously, there was a smaller, more nodular focus in the
immediately adjacent centrum semiovale. Allowing for the marked
limitation in the post-contrast imaging, no other definite
enhancing focus is seen, with apparent interval resolution of
the left-sided subcortical white matter, temporal lobar and
cerebellar hemispheric foci. Currently, there is no pathologic
leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement.  There is no
definite focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic
event, and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids,
including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved and
these structures enhance normally.  In comparison to the more
remote study there is no definite progression of the marked
global atrophy (particularly given the patient's age) or the
severe diffuse atrophy of the corpus callosum. Limited imaging
of the upper cervical spinal cord, through the mid-C4 level,
demonstrates no definite abnormality.
IMPRESSION: The study, particularly the post-contrast MP-RAGE
acquisition, is quite limited by motion artifact, with:
1. No significant change in the overall extensive demyelinating
""disease
burden."" 2. Curvilinear rim-enhancing focus in the right corona
radiata appears new since the [**2117-4-6**] study and likely
represents a site of active inflammation; allowing for the
limitation above, there is no definite additional enhancing
focus, with apparent interval resolution of many of the foci
demonstrated on that study. 3. Marked global and corpus callosal
atrophy, not significantly changed since the [**9-/2109**] study.

CXR [**2118-3-25**]: : A right-sided PICC terminates within the distal
SVC. The aeration of the lungs has improved compared to the
prior study. Cardiac silhouette is stable. No large pleural
effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax. Bones are intact.
IMPRESSION: Right-sided PICC terminating within the distal SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45855**] is a 44yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with a
UTI and new onset seizures.
.
After initially being admitted to the floor, he developed
seizures requiring 10mg IV ativan and started on fosphenytoin
with a load and transferred to the MICU.  He was noted to be
increasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea.  ABG
showed acidemia with CO2 on the 70s.  He was started on Bipap
with improvement in his CO2.  It was presumed that his central
apnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowly
improved with clearance of the ativan.  He was started
emperically on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclivir to cover both his UTI and
for empiric coverage for meningitis given his AMS. A head MRI
was done, which showed unchanged appearance of extensive
demyelinated, w/ new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia,
likely site of active inflammation, no evidence of ischemic
event, unchanged marked global atrophy. Given that meningitis
was less likely he was narrowed to vanc/[**Known lastname **].  He began to
wake up over the day on [**3-19**] and was weaned off BiPap to a
shovel mask and transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, he remained stable throughout the day on [**3-20**].
However, that morning was noted to be more tachycardic and
febrile to 103 in the setting of hypoxia to the 80s.  He was put
on a NRB and sats remained in the 80s for a while before
improving to the mid- 90s.  ABG on NRB was 7.48/40/72.  His eyes
were open but wasn't following commands and appeared obtunded on
the floor. CXR on the floor showed no new infiltrate.  Patient
was transitioned to the MICU and briefly broadened to
vanco/[**Month/Year (2) **]/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, but quickly
narrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status.  By
morning patient was alert and oriented X3, communicating and
breathing comfortably on 2L nasal cannula with saturation in mid
to high 90s.  Abx were again narrowed to [**Month/Year (2) 21347**]/Vanco for
coverage of UTI. Patient was then called out to floor.
.
#) Seizures (new): several possible etiologies in this patient;
he has severe multiple sclerosis, and though he has never had a
seizure before, there is a new area of inflammation on his MRI.
Infectious causes in setting of severe MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45861**]
seizures, most notably his UTI. He was started on fosphenytoin
IV initially, then transitioned to phenytoin PO once mental
status improved. There was no sign of further seizure activity.
He will f/u w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in ~2 weeks
.
# Altered mental status: per wife, was at baseline until the
seizures. 24h EEG did not show status epilepticus. Mental status
then to near baseline by discharge suggesting largely resultant
from infections/medications/post-ictal state.
.
#) Apnea/Hypercarbia: fully resolved as his mental status
improved once coming out of the MICU the 2nd time.
.
#) UTI: growing MRSA and pseudomonas. He will is on
vancomycin/ceftazidime, and will complete a 14 day course. A
PICC line was insserted and home infusion company will assist w/
antibiotics. There was a question of home aids flushing his
foley, thus potentially introducing pathogens. There should be
no flushing of the foley and this was addressed w/ wife and in
page 1 instructions.
.
#) Rash w/ vancomycin: pt did develop red rash on arms and face
w/ vancomycin infusion. Component of redman syndrome was
suspected. Benedaryl was given w/ vancomycin and this improved
his symptoms. There was no other evidence of allergic disease,
and no facial swelling or airway obstruction.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia- Bseline ~150's, went downt to 89 this
admission. No signs of active bleeding. No rashes on exam. He
had been exposed to heparin in the last 30 days, so PF4 antibody
was checked and was negative. His platelets responded to
baseline by discharge, and likely this was all secondary to
acute infection.
.
#) Multiple sclerosis: initially held home home baclofen given
AMS, but restarted by discharge once mental status improved.
.
#) HTN: continued home amlodipine
.
# CODE: DNI/DNR (confirmed with wife)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname 45855**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
for a urinary tract infection. You then developed seizures. You
had a head MRI, which showed a new area of multiple sclerosis,
and this plus the infection is probably why you had a seizure.
You were started on antibiotics and anti-seizure medications,
and got much better.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
** START phenytoin (dilantin) [anti-seizure medication]. Take
150mg in the morning and at noon, and 200mg at night (3 total
doses per day)
** START vancomycin [antibiotic]
** START ceftazidine [antibiotic]
** START benadryl, take 20 minutes before vancomycin infusion

Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Pt woke up this morning with R sided pleuritic chest pain that
awoke her from sleep.  She said it felt sharp, worse with
inspiration.  No SOB but tried not to take deep breaths [**2-26**]
pain.  Has had recent cough about 2 weeks ago, given
azithromycin with resolution of cough, no production.  No recent
prolonged travel - longest car ride was about 1 1/2 hours.  Pt
denies swelling in legs.  Pt denies fevers at home.  Has not had
any miscarriages in the past.  Pt's last [**Last Name (un) 3907**] was last year -
did have a breast biopsy 2-3 years ago but was not malignant.
Had a colonoscopy 6-8 months ago, negative, no h/o blood in
stool.
.
At the OSH, CT chest noted 11mm lung nodule, 14mm thyroid
nodule, and saddle pulmonary embolus.  Pt was started on a
heparin gtt and was transferred here.  At [**Hospital1 18**], her vital signs
were stable - 98, 77, 121/80, 16, 98% 2L.  She was guaiac
negative.  CXR was performed.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no
RV collapse.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
Lives with her husband.  Used to work at a jeweler's and at a
bank, stopped in [**2171**] [**2-26**] MS.  Pt is ambulatory at home and gets
around by herself.  Has been smoking 1/2ppd for about 40 years.
Occasional social EtOH, h/o cocaine use in [**2163**], none recently.

Family History:

Abd: soft, obese, NT/ND, - masses
Ext: 1+ pitting edema, RLE with more erythema and warmth than
LLE, no tenderness to palpation of calves, no palpable cords

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT (OSH read): PE involving both main pulmonary artery
bifurcations and branches, 11mm nodular density in LUL;
atelectasis at both bases; 14mm low attenuation nodule in L lobe
of thyroid
.
CXR: Linear opacity in L lung base, atelectasis vs early PNA,
cannot r/o small L pleural effusion; cardiomegaly
.
EKG:  59bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, deep Q in III but no S1 or
T3, poor R wave progression

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yoF with history of multiple sclerosis transferred from OSH
with saddle pulmonary embolism and left lung nodule.
.
# Pulmonary embolus: Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management
of saddle pulmonary embolus.  Pt did not have any risk factors
for thrombus, although LUL nodule in setting of tobacco use is
concerning for underlying malignancy.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable without evidence of right heart strain on
echo and no RAD on EKG.  The magnitude of PE and hemodynamic
stability may suggest a chronicity of her process.  Patient had
large RLE DVT and a pulomonary/interventional pulmonary consults
were placed.  An IVC filter was not deemed an appopriate option.
 CT head had been concerning for embolus/PFO showing possible
infarction; MRI head without these findings, however, showed
changes consistent with multiple sclerosis.
- Coumadin - lovenox bridge started [**2-23**], to have PT/INR checked
[**2-26**] by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 702**] by him, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**].  Plan for
coumadin 5mg  x 2days, [**2-24**] and [**2-25**], with INR check [**2-26**] -
further assessment of coumadin dose as above.
- coagulation studies/panel will need to be undertaken as an
outpatient.
- [**Month (only) 116**] need 6-9 months of anti-coagulation, possibly lifelong if
this is indeed secondary to malignancy
- PULM CONSULT RECS:
1. Chest CT (non-contrast in 6 weeks).  She will need follow-up
which can be local, but alternatively she may follow up here.
2. Continue anticoagulation, as above
3. No role for IVC filter in this hemodynamically stable patient
who is tolerating anticoagulation.
4. Usual hypercoagulation workup (Protein C, S; ATIII; lupus
anticoagulant; cardiolipin antibodies; prothrombin gene mutation
[**Numeric Identifier 23885**]; homocysteine).  Also age appropriate cancer screenings as
outpatient.
.
# Lung mass: 11 mm nodule seen in LUL on OSH CT chest. PE raises
suspicion of pulmonary malignancy.
- Biopsy deferred due to size of mass.  Needs CT follow-up in
[**4-30**] weeks, scheduled follow-up with [**Hospital1 **] pulmonologist in [**Month (only) 547**],
as above.
.
# Thyroid nodule: 14 mm nodule seen on OSH CT chest. PE raises
suspicion of malignancy.
- Will need reassessment of this nodule, perhaps biopsy as
deemed indicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**], as well as thryoid function
tests repeated.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient functional at baseline;
ambulatory. No acute issues.
- Continue topamax
- Patient would optimally benefit from seeing a neurologist on
an outpatient basis.

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2129-12-14**]):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan on Admission:
In summary, patient is a 50yo RHM with hx of MS followed per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] but not on any maintenance treatment who had a stroke
which left him R hemiplegic/wheelchair bound since [**8-24**].  He has
been residing in a nursing home where he is near total-care
dependent but developed L leg weakness with tingling sensation
from knee down since 5 days ago that was worsening hence went to
[**Hospital **] Hospital where he had head CT without acute pathology
prior to transfer.  Although denied per patient, patient on
Levaquin for the past 7 days for UTI.
.
On exam, patient does have R facial droop and R sided weakness
consistent with UMN pattern weakness.  Patient appears to have
had a L MCA division stroke although unclear etiology given no
known vascular risk factors.  As for his L leg weakness and
numbness, unclear if new stroke or unmasking of prior MS [**Hospital 54369**]
or new MS flare.  Given possible progression, less likely new
stroke and more likely unmasking of MS [**First Name (Titles) 54369**] [**Last Name (Titles) 54370**] by the
UTI.
.
Initially thought to admit to neurology but patient developed
Afib rhythm and RVR plus unstable BP, recommend patient to be
admitted to MICU wiht neurology following on consult service.
Patient likely has paroxysmal Afib which was the cause behind
his
stroke in [**8-24**].

RECS:
1. Agree with MICU admission given unstable vitals.
2. Follow-up with urine culture to ensure that patient being
properly treated.
3. Would recommend MRI/A head with and without contrast (new
stroke v. MS flare) and MRA of neck as well.
4. Would anticoagulate given Afib - no contraindication from
stroke perspective.
5. Would recommend tight glycemic control and maintain
euthermia.
6. Will follow on consult service.
---
ICU course:
Patient arrived to MICU [**2129-12-12**] on loading dose of amiodarone
at 1 mg.  Patient was origically in A-fib on arrival to MICU.
Amiodarone drip was decreased to 0.5mg/min.  Pt converted to NSR
overnight.  Amiodarone drip was discontinued in the morning of
[**2129-12-13**] and pt started on PO amiodarone.  Started on Coumadin
that afternoon witha dose of 3mg.  Patient transferred to
neurology unit later in the evening on [**2129-12-13**].
.
Hospital course on neurology [**Hospital1 **]:
Neuro: Imaging done on admission included MR HEAD W & W/O
CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MRA NECK W&W/O CONTRAST.
Imaging was negative for new stroke or acute process.
Consideration was made for possible use of steroids to treat MS
flare.  However, his admission blood cultures indicated CONS
bacteremia and urine culture was positive for enteroccus.
Therefore, steroids were not administered.  This infectious
process may have been contributing to his presenting symptoms.
His neurologic exam remained stable throughout his hospital
course notable for his residual right sided hemiparesis and left
lower extremity weakness.
.
ID: ID was consulted regarding his admission blood cultures
(done on [**2129-12-13**])which indicated CONS bacteremia  and urine
culture (done on [**2129-12-12**]) which as positive for enteroccus.
Their final recommendations were to treat with vancomycin for a
total of 14 days (day 1 = [**2129-12-15**] and day 14 = [**2129-12-28**]), and to
obtain daily blood cultures until negative for 48 hours.  Blood
cultures from [**2129-12-15**], [**2129-12-16**], [**2129-12-17**], [**2129-12-18**], and [**2129-12-19**] are
still pending at time of transfer.  Also, repeat urine culture
from [**2129-12-19**] is still pending at time of transfer.  He remained
afebrile during his hospital course. A PICC line was placed on
[**2129-12-20**] so that he may complete his course of vancomycin at his
rehab facility. He should be continued on vancomycin with the
last day of treatment on [**2129-12-28**].
.
Cardio:Treated in ICU with Amiodarone drip which was changed to
amiodarone 400 mg PO BID for 7 days, with plan to change to
amiodarone 400 mg PO daily on [**2129-12-20**] for 7 days, then 200 mg
daily thereafter (starting on [**2129-12-27**]).
.
Heme: In the ICU, he was started on coumadin. On the neuro [**Hospital1 **],
fondoparinux and coumadin was discontinued to elevated INR.  On
[**2129-12-20**], INR was 2.7 and coumadin was restarted at 2 mg daily.
His INR should be followed once discharged and coumadin dose
adjusted accordingly.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
Blueberry [**Doctor Last Name **] Healthcare - [**Hospital1 **]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Multiple Sclerosis
history of left parietal stroke
atrial fibrillation


Discharge Condition:
Neurologic examination is notable for a normal mental status.
Cranial
nerves II to XII are notable for a right lower facial droop.  He
has no red desaturation.  He is plegic on the right
side but the left upper extremity is strong at 5/5 while the
left
lower extremity is [**3-20**] in left ileopsoas, [**4-19**] at quadriceps, [**4-19**]
at hamstrings, [**3-20**] [**Last Name (un) 938**], and [**3-20**] left tibialis anterior.  His
reflexes are 2+ on the right with sustained clonus in the right
ankle.  The left side is 2+ in the left upper extremity, 3+ in
left knee, and 3+ in left ankle.  Coordination reveals tremors
on
finger-nose-finger.  He cannot walk.


Discharge Instructions:
You have a history of multiple sclerosis, left parietal stroke
in [**2129-8-16**], and history of atrial fibrillation, and you
were admitted with weakness and numbness in your left leg.  On
day of admission, you required brief ICU admission for rate
control for atrial fibrillation. The next day you were
transferred to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] for further care.  Your
admission blood cultures were found to grow bacteria and your
admission urine culture revealed that you had a urinary tract
infection.  Therefore, you were started on the antibiotic called
vancomycin.  The infectious disease service was involved in your
care. The plan is to transfer you back to your rehab facility
with a PICC line so that you can complete the 14 day course of
the antibiotic, vancomycin.

Please follow-up with your neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Please take all medications as prescribed.

On this day, I saw and examined Mr. [**Known firstname 54371**] [**Known lastname 13972**] and
reviewed
the note of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 34062**] [**Doctor Last Name **].  I agree with the findings and plan
of care.  He developed weakness in the left leg about 6 days
ago.
He was unable to lift it as well as before.  He went to [**Hospital **]
Hospital and had tachycardia.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
here he was found to be in atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
He is in the MICU and he is rate controlled.  He had a recent
stroke resulting in right hemiplegia about 2 months ago.
His left leg could be neurological exacerbation secondary to his
atrial fibrillation and cerebral hypoperfusion, or multiple
sclerosis flare-up.  He will get an MRI and then the NMED team
will decide on treating him with corticosteroid.


Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Phone
number:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5434**].

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] MEDICINE

Patient is a 53 year-old female with a complex history
significant for multiple sclerosis complicated by
quadriplegia, status post cholecystectomy, status post
hepaticojejunostomy, status post ileal loop conduit and neo
bladder formation, multiple urinary tract infections,
multiple episodes of cholangitis and cholestasis.  She was in
her usual state of health until two months ago when she
suffered the sudden onset of a chronic abdominal pain and
marked fever.  She was hospitalized at [**Hospital6 33**]
on [**1-31**] for suspected ileus which was ultimately complicated
by a pseudomonal bacteremia from the urine infection which
was treated with ceftazidine although complicated by a C.
difficile colitis infection.  She had an endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography performed on [**2-22**] of this
year which found evidence of a sharp cut off in the common
bile duct and found evidence of a biliary stent which was
removed although no dye was extravasated past the site of the
cut off.  She was discharged home on Flagyl and ceftazidine.
She was readmitted on [**3-8**] at [**Hospital6 33**] for a
spiking temperature to 103 degrees, complaints of diffuse
abdominal pain and protracted nausea and vomiting with
evidence of nonbilious, nonbloody vomitus.  Her hospital
course there was marked by elevation of her liver function
tests above the baseline and although blood cultures found no
evidence of bacteremia she was found to have a polymicrobial
urinary tract infection, Providencia Stuartii enterococcus
and alpha hemolytic strep.  She was placed on Zosyn and
ampicillin to treat this and was referred to [**Hospital1 346**] for evaluation of her chronically
elevated liver function tests and recurrent episodes of
cholangitis.  At [**Hospital6 33**] she also received a
hepatic biopsy which showed evidence of chronic bilious
cholestasis with proliferation of bile ducts and fibrosis of
hepatic tissue.  On transfer patient is without complaint of
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or
chest pain.  She does have a positive history of diarrhea
within the last few days although recently she has been some
chronic constipation as [**Last Name (un) **] which is her baseline.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Multiple sclerosis diagnosed 14
years ago and followed by quadriplegia for the last five
years.  2) Cholecystectomy performed in [**2134-9-30**] at
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital complicated the contained leak of bile.  3)
Hepaticojejunostomy performed at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital [**10-30**] with
Roux-en-Y jejunal limb attached to the site of biliary leak.
4) Recurrent cholangitis: greater than four episodes over the
last year usually evaluated at [**Hospital6 33**].  5)
Chronic hepatitis:  work up has included negative viral
serologies, negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative smooth muscle antibodies
as well.  Recent liver biopsy at [**Hospital6 33**] as
described.  6) Ileal loop conduit urostomy:  with right
ureteral stent for recurrent episodes of urosepsis.  7) PEG
placement.  8) C. difficile colitis.  9) Pseudomonas
bacteremia.  10) Recurrent urinary tract infection.  11)
Chronic anemia.  12)  Chronic back pain.  13) Multiple
decubitus ulcers requiring surgical repair.  14) Depression.

RELEVANT DATA:  Chest x-ray performed on hospital day one
shows a left pleural effusion with atelectasis, no evidence
of consolidation.  Admission laboratories include white count
of 16.8, hematocrit 22.1, platelet count 331, coags normal
with INR of 1.1, ALT 137, AST 73, direct bilirubin 3.2, total
bilirubin 4.2, alkaline phosphatase 502, GGT 528.  Sodium
137, potassium 3.0, chloride 102, bicarb 25, BUN 6,
creatinine 0.3, glucose 91, calcium 8.6, phosphate 2.4,
magnesium 1.8, albumin 3.2.  Urinalysis negative.  Hepatitis
serologies A, B and C negative.  Antimitochondrial antibody
negative, ENKA negative.  [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titration of
1:40, CEA of 2.3 and CA [**51**]-9 of 323.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Infectious disease:  Patient was admitted with a diagnosis of
polymicrobial urinary tract infection with no evidence of
septicemia with negative blood cultures at outside hospital.
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended the
discontinuation of Ampicillin and continued Zosyn with a 14
day course ending [**4-6**] and the adding on of Flagyl for 19
day course overlapping by five days past the end of the Zosyn
for fear of C. difficile infection given past histories of C.
difficile colitis and Flagyl.  End date is [**4-12**].  Notably
urine cultures showed no growth and blood cultures are
negative thus far.  Infectious disease consult considers
likely source of recent fevers to be either biliary sepsis
given recurrent episodes of cholangitis in the past or due to
polymicrobial urinary tract infection.  Of note, infectious
disease considers possibility that urinary tract infection
may be fictitious given the possibility that the urine sample
at the outside hospital may have been taken from her
colonized urostomy bag rather than through direct
catheterization of the urinary stoma given the lack of white
cell counts in the outside hospital urinalysis is consistent
with the possible diagnosis.  C. difficile antigen test was
obtained and came back negative.  Ms. [**Known lastname 55636**] remained
afebrile throughout the duration of her hospital course with
a mild low grade temperature of 100.9 degrees recorded after
PTC procedure was performed likely due to transient biliary
bacteremia.  Her white count decreased on intravenous Zosyn
and Flagyl from admission of 16.8 to 8.6 on hospital day two
trending up to a stable 14 and then spiking to 34.2 on
hospital day six after performance of a percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography.  It is suspected this is due
again to a transient biliary bacteremia and will likely
resolve while covered by the intravenous Zosyn and Flagyl.

2.  Chronic biliary stasis:  The patient has had a diagnosis
of chronically elevated liver function tests for several
years and recurrent episodes of cholangitis.  A thorough work
up of her chronic hepatitis was obtained at the outside
hospital including negative viral serologies, negative
antimitochondrial antibody, negative anti-smooth muscle
antibodies.  An endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography was performed at the outside
hospital and findings showed cut off at common bile duct.
Upon comparison with earlier operative reports this seemed
consistent with a surgical ligation of the common bile duct
during performance of hepaticojejunostomy.  A liver biopsy
was also obtained at the outside hospital showing evidence of
chronic biliary stasis and biliary cirrhosis with
proliferation of bile ducts and fibrosis of the biliary tree.
Hepatology service was consulted and believes her overall
picture was consistent with an obstructive cirrhosis with a
predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia suggestive of chronic
cholestasis.  They suggested further evaluation by endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography to evaluate for possible
diagnosis and therapeutic intervention to correct a probable
biliary stenosis.  An MRCP was obtained on hospital day one
showing evidence of moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation and probable common hepatic duct stricture.
Incidental findings of multiple cystic lesions in the
pancreatic body and tail consistent with chronic pancreatitis
or intraductal papillary mucinous tumor was also identified.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography consult was
obtained and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
was performed on hospital day four finding evidence of
previous sphincterotomy of the major papilla and surgical
ligation of the common bile duct, although the afferent limb
of the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was visualized it was
not deemed safe to explore this further and the endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography recommended further
follow up with a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
This PTC was performed on hospital day five showing a 99
percent stricture of the anastomosis of the
hepaticojejunostomy which was dilated and stented with
placement of an external biliary drain.  Per interventional
radiology recommendations this external biliary drain was
capped on hospital day six and it is recommended that it be
kept in for four to six weeks to continue dilation and
opening of the anastomosis.  It can be removed by follow up
by interventional radiology.

3.  Cystic pancreatic lesions:  On hospital day one an MRCP
was obtained which found an incidental finding of multiple
cystic lesions in the pancreatic body and tail consistent
with either chronic pancreatitis or intraductal papillary
mucinous tumor.  This should be followed by the patient's
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, CEA tumor marker came
normal at 2.3 but a CA19-9 was highly elevated at 323.  The
CA19-9 can be elevated by biliary stasis as well as
cholangitis, two conditions which the patient is known to
have.  It is recommended that a repeat CA19-9 be obtained at
the discretion of the primary care physician when these
issues have further resolved.  Possible work up by another
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy or
MRI may also be entertained.

4.  Multiple sclerosis:  The patient has maintained her
baseline quadriplegia.  Considering her high risk for deep
venous thrombosis she was placed on pneumoboot and
subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis.  She did not have any
increasing oxygen demand suggestive of no pulmonary embolism.

5.  Access:  The patient was transferred from outside
hospital with no peripheral intravenous access.  A femoral
line was placed in her right groin without event on hospital
day one and was removed on hospital day three when a PICC
line was placed by interventional radiology.

6.  Back pain:  The patient has chronic back pain which was
treated successfully with baclofen and the institution of an
air mattress.  She did not have any complaints of back pain
throughout the duration of her hospitalization.

7.  Depression:  The patient has baseline depression
responsive to Prozac on which she maintained throughout the
duration of her hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is being evaluated for placement in
a long term care facility.  Further addendum will be dictated
with any new discharge instructions.

33.9, platelets 435.  Chemistries unremarkable.  Her ABG
shows a gas of 7.41, 43, 62.  Her LFTs show an ALT of 124,
AST 107, alk phos 788 up from 496, total bili 2.8, lactase
1.3.  She has blood cultures from [**3-28**] and [**3-24**] which are
pending at time of transfer.  Urine culture from the 29 is
also negative.  Of note, at the outside hospital from [**3-3**],
the patient had a urine culture with Providencia stuartii,
Enterococcus, and in [**1-31**] had a history of Pseudomonas UTI
with C. difficile infection.  She had an MR of the abdomen on
[**2137-3-24**] showing status post cholecystectomy and
choledochojejunostomy, with moderate intrahepatic biliary
dilation, with question of a common bile duct stricture, and
multiple cystic lesions of the pancreatic body and tail
consistent with a chronic pancreatis, versus intraductal
papillary mucinous tumor.  Her chest x-ray from time of
transfer shows questionable consolidation in left lower lobe,
but no tracheal deviation, and right side without focal
consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS - 1) PULMONARY:  The
patient was transferred initially to ICU for acute hypoxia
and respiratory distress.  Initial chest x-ray suggestive of
lobar collapse presumed secondary to mucous plugging.  She
has a history of tracheostomy, but at current point her code
status is DNR/DNI.  She, therefore, was not a candidate for
intubation.  One of the goals of transfer to ICU was for more
aggressive physical chest PT.  Over the course of her ICU
stay, the patient's respiratory status improved markedly.
Zosyn and Flagyl she had been on empirically for a history of
UTIs.  The patient had vancomycin added for ?MRSA.  Her
sputum cultures were obtained, but never did grow out
positive organisms.  However, clinically she did improve over
her ICU course, and vancomycin was continued for a 14-day
course which will be completed on the [**4-12**].

There was also concern, given patient's history, that part of
the respiratory demise may have been secondary to aspiration.
As such, she underwent further adjustment of her PEG tube to
a J-tube in an effort to minimize the risk of aspiration.  At
the time of this dictation, the patient is beginning to
tolerate her tube feeds without difficulty.  In summary, the
patient will complete her vancomycin course for 14 days.  She
will still require aggressive chest physical therapy and
mobilization.  She has been given inexsufflator to help
mobilize secretions.  Her O2 requirements have decreased
dramatically.  At time of dictation, she is satting into the
mid-90s an FIO2 of 0.4.  Her chest x-rays have shown
remarkable improvement from her initial lobar collapse.

2) CARDIOVASCULAR:  Despite the patient's acute hypoxia, the
patient has remained hemodynamically stable during the entire
ICU course.  She was, however, found to be persistently
tachycardic into the 120s and 130s.  EKGs and telemetry
showed sinus rhythm.  The exact etiology of the sinus
tachycardia is unclear.  She had several sets of negative
cardiac enzymes.  A TSH was checked and was normal.  It was
presumed that her volume status was optimized.  She also had
an echocardiogram which essentially was unremarkable, showing
an ejection fraction of near-60% without any structural
abnormalities, or definite pericardial effusions.  It is
thought that some of the tachycardia may be secondary to
autonomic dysfunction with her multiple sclerosis.  Given the
fact that she was also slightly hypertensive at times into
the systolic 140s and 150s, she was empirically treated with
a beta blocker.  Her heart rates have shown marked
improvement.  She has come down into the 60s and 70s.  Her
pressures have shown improvement.  She will be discharged on
atenolol.

3) GI:  The patient has a complicated biliary history, having
been status post hepaticojejunostomy and status post
cholecystectomy with a history of recurrent cholangitis.
There was initially thoughts about biliary strictures.  She
came to the ICU postoperative day #2, status post PTC.  She
will be completing antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl,
initially for urinary tract infections, that also will cover
any biliary source of infection.  During her ICU course, her
LFTs did show marked improvement.  Her alk phos has been
slightly elevated; the patient is currently asymptomatic
without any signs of fevers or white count, and this will be
followed quite closely.

Also from a GI standpoint, it was thought that aspiration may
be a contributing factor to her respiratory demise.  She
currently had a PEG tube in place.  It was then decided that
the patient may benefit from a J-tube to prevent further risk
of aspiration.  She underwent successful J-tube placement on
[**2137-4-3**] without complications.  At the time of discharge,
the patient is tolerating her tube feeds well.  She will
likely need aggressive promotility agents, including Reglan
and a possible return of her L-Hyoscyamine 0.125 mg tid.  She
also now has a double-lumen PICC in place also placed on [**4-4**], in case she may require chronic TPN.

4) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially transferred
to the ICU on both metronidazole and Zosyn initially for
treatment of urinary tract infections, and also as coverage
for biliary manipulation.  She will complete her course of
Flagyl on [**4-12**].  Her Zosyn was initially continued.
However, she later developed a macular slightly raised rash
on the lower extremities.  It was thought that this may have
been secondary to a possible drug rash related to Zosyn.  As
such, the patient was switched to ciprofloxacin on [**4-1**].
She will complete her course of cipro on [**4-6**].  Meanwhile,
the patient was started on vancomycin on [**3-30**], and was then
transferred to the ICU, for thought of a possible infectious
etiology of her respiratory compromise.  Sputum cultures,
blood cultures, and urine cultures from her ICU stay have all
been negative.  She has remained afebrile during her ICU
course, and her white count has come down considerably
although still mildly elevated.

5) HEMATOLOGY:  The patient's hematocrit and platelets have
remained during the hospital course.  She, as always, will
require constant, continuous DVT prophylaxis.  Also of note,
she had a double-lumen PICC placed in her left upper
extremity on [**2137-4-3**].

6) RENAL/FEN:  The patient's electrolytes remained stable
during her hospital course.  She had good urine output.  She
was felt to be relatively euvolemic at time of discharge.
She had her PEG tube readjusted to a J-tube, and was
restarted on tube feeding on the [**4-4**] with ProMod with
full fiber strength with goal tube feeding rate to be 70
cc/h.  It is important that she also receive promotility
agents to prevent the risk of aspiration.  As mentioned above
also, she has a double-lumen PICC in the case that her new
J-tube does not reduce the risk of aspiration, and the
patient possibly may require TPN.

DISPOSITION:  The patient, at this time, is DNR/DNI.  She
will be returning back to nursing home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute respiratory distress thought secondary to left lower
lobe collapse secondary to mucous plugging, questionable
aspiration pneumonia now resolving.

IMPRESSION: Large acute on chronic right subdural hematoma
causing marked mass effect and midline shift causing entrapment
of the left lateral ventricle. Subfalcine herniation with
effacement of the basal cisterns without frank uncal herniation.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-3-21**] 3:33 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of large right subdural hematoma with
interval improvement in the degree of mass effect and midline
shift. Effacement of the basal cisterns is unchanged. There
remains subfalcine herniation. The left lateral ventricle
remains enlarge.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2114-3-21**] 5:19 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of large right subdural hematoma with
interval improvement of leftward subfalcine herniation.
2. Diffusion-weighted imaging abnormality indicating acute
ischemic changes involving the medial temporal lobes
bilaterally, right greater than left, mid brain, and pons.
Hemorrhages associated with the abnormalities in the mid brain.
These likely represent manifestations of prior herniation injury
or possibly contusions from prior trauma.
3. Periventricular white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity which
likely represents transependymal edema from hydrocephalus. More
focal areas of signal abnormality within the periventricular
white matter may also represent manifestation of transependymal
edema or preexisting white matter disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt arrived in the ED @ [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and unresponsive, with
fixed/dilated pupils and decorticate posturing.  After a head CT
that showed a large right-sided subdural hematoma with 2cm
midline shift, he was taken emergently to the OR for a right
craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma.  Post-operatively, his
left pupil decreased to 3mm (but still unreactive), and his R
eye remained fixed and dilated @ 5mm; he was transferred
post-operatively to the SICU.

There was no change in examination over the first 24 hours.  An
MRI was ordered to determine what brain tissue had infarcted,
and DWI positive lesions consistent with infarct were seen in
the temporal lobes, midbrain and pons.  A stroke consult was
called on [**2114-3-22**] and the stroke team evaluated the patient and
informed the family of the poor prognosis.

Based on their discussions with neurology and neurosurgery, the
family decided to make the patient comfort measures only.  This
was done around 1900 [**2114-3-22**] and the patient expired at 2045.

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70884**] is a 57 yo male with h/o MS who presented to OSH
today with respiratory distress. Per friend and notes patient
was fine last night. Today he was coughing for several hours and
at ~ 5 pm he was found vomiting, coughing and aspirating emesis.
He was SOB, RR was 36-40 and O2 sat was 84 % on RA.  He was
suctioned and treated with O2.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] where HR was 160, BP 140/90,RR
36 and O2 sat was 84% on RA. He was given metronidazole,
levofloxacin and ativan. He was paralyzed (etomidate 20 mg IV,
succinyl choline 125 mg IV) and intubated. He was given fentanyl
50 IV x2. OG tube was placed and brownish material came back.
Peripheral neosynephrine was started after a failed line attempt
for systolics in the 80s. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further w/u.
.
In the ER here temp was 102, HR 150s (?afib), BP was in the 80s
systolic. Lactate was 7.4, WBC 1.3 with 58% bands. A central
line was placed and patient was started on levophed. His abdomen
appeared distended so abd/pelvis CT was done.  It showed
evidence of bowel obstruction.  Surgery was consulted and did
not see a need for surgical intervention.  Additionally CXR was
done and showed a multifocal pneumonia. CT c-spine did not show
an acute fracture.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Advance diet to ground solids & thin liquids by single
    cup sip only, NO STRAWS!! No Mixed consistencies like
    cold cereal w/milk or chicken soup w/liquid and solids
    together.

2.  Medications crushed in puree

3.  Strict Aspiration Precautions:
    A.  PT MUST BE FED BY STAFF!
    B.  Remind him to eat & drink SLOWLY and
    C.  No Talking w/food/liquid in his mouth
    D.  Single cup sips of thin liquid, NO STRAWS
    E.  Hold liquid in mouth & keep head level
        (don't look up or throw head back when drinking)
    F.  Alternate between bites and sips

4.  If he coughs while drinking, downgrade his diet to Nectar-
    Thick liquids.  If he has any signs of coughing or choking
    on ground solids, downgrade to Pureed foods.  If he
    does well w/ground solids, consider upgrading to soft
    solids while carefully alternating between bites and sips

5.  Repeat the videoswallow if his mental status or medical
    status worsens to be sure this diet is still safe

PROGNOSIS:
Prognosis for safe swallowing without aspiration is good if he
is
supervised to take single sips of liquid and alternate between
bites and sips.  However, if he drinks from a straw or feeds
himself, he tends to ""gulp & shovel"" liquid/food into his mouth,
placing him at significant risk to aspirate.  Also, his level of
alertness/attention vary throughout the day.  Please don't feed
him when he is not alert, attentive and appropirately following
commands.
.
.
[**2131-1-29**]: TTE with bubble study:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good  leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 yo male with h/o MS who presents with hypoxia,
hypotension, neutropenia, fevers, ileus with likely PNA and UTI,
intubated for respiratory failure & sepsis.
.
# pulmonary: On arrival to the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 70884**] was hypoxic,
hypotensive, neutropenic, febrile and was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Source of his respiratory failure was
likely aspiration in the setting of sepsis.  He was initially
treated with treated with meropenem x 7 days given concern for
aspiration pneumonia in this man who is chronic resident of an
extended care facility.  A BAL was performed which showed 1+ gm
pos cocci in pairs and negative cultures.  On [**1-19**], a SBT was
performed and patient was successfully extubated.  Following
extubation, he continued to have copious secretions with
diminished gag, requiring vigorous chest PT.  On [**1-23**], CXR
appeared markedly worsened consolidation representing
aspiration.  Patient has weak gag and is not completely clearing
copious secretions.  Due to leukocytosis, ? consolidation, pt
was started on Zosyn as empiric therapy for hospital acquired vs
recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
.
Pt was called out to medical floor on [**2131-1-28**].  A CTA was
obtained [**2-9**] persistent tachycardia and oxygen requirement
(2-3L), which revealed bilateral PE.  Pt was started on heparin,
then transitioned to lovenox and coumadin.  He was weaned off of
oxygen, and breathing comfortably on RA on [**1-29**].  Pt discharged
on [**1-31**] with instructions to continue coumadin, and lovenox
injections twice daily, and to have daily INRs checked and faxed
to his PCP ([**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70885**]) with
goal INR [**2-10**].  He may discontinue his lovenox injections once
his INR is therapeutic (INR [**2-10**]) or as instructed by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] his pneumonia, pt will complete a 14 day course of
zosyn and vancomycin (via PICC) for hospital acquired pneumonia
(day 1 [**2131-1-23**], last day [**2131-2-5**]).  Pt may benefit from ongoing
chest PT to help mobilize his secretions.
.
.
# altered mental status: pt with h/o multiple sclerosis.  at
times, pt noted to be talking out loud with no one in room but
was easily redirectable.  In the ICU, this was attributed to ICU
delirium after intubation/sedation, acute illness, lack of sleep
vs. MS [**First Name (Titles) 10942**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. thiamine deficiency.  Of note, per
family, patient's MS has been known to flare in the setting of
infection and has caused paralysis.  Pt's mental status improved
gradually at time of callout to medical service, and per
disucssion on [**1-29**] with pt's PCP and with his daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**1-30**], pt's mental status appeared close to baseline
(he was a&ox3, mumbling, and somewhat distractable, but aware of
current events, and of his recent medical history).  While in
the ICU, pt developed acute onset of weakeness in hiw upper
extremities, whichw as felt [**2-9**] to his MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] demonstrated
marked improvement over the course of his stay on the medical
floor, and had [**4-12**] bilateral strength of biceps, triceps, and
delts at the time of discharge.  pt does not currently have a
neurologist, discussion with pt's previous neurologist (dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital1 **], last saw pt [**9-12**]), suggest that pt lacks some
insight at baseline, but is generally a&ox3, and understands
some current events and some of his PMH.
.
.
# hypotension/sepsis:  Sources of infection considered included
pneumonia (aspiration) and UTI. Hypotension could also be [**2-9**]
fluid losses in the setting of pancreatitis, cardiac causes such
as AMI or inadequate CO in the setting of rapid heart rate.  Pt
had a history of urosepsis, with MRSA and multidrug resistant
proteus.  He was initially maintained on single pressor titrated
to goal MAP 70.  His basal cortisol level was 35.3 and did not
elevate with cosyntropin stimulation; he was treated with a
course of hydrocort and fludrocort.  In the setting of profound
septic shock, he was initially started on Meropenem & Linezolid
given concern for aspiration pna and h/o VRE in urine.  He
completed a 7-day course of meropenem; Linezolid was d/c'd on
day 6 as it may have been trigger for pancreatitis.  Pt
subsequently started treatment for a hospital acquired pneumonia
on [**1-23**] given +BAL for GPCs, worsening sputum producing, and new
leukocytosis.  Surveillance blood cultures on [**1-17**] have shown
NGTD.  Surveillance urine cultures on [**1-15**] showed NGTD.
.
.
# cardiac: no cardiac history, pt denies chest pain or shortness
of breath upon admission to the medical service.  mild elevation
in trop during ICU admission felt [**2-9**] demand in setting of
hypotension and sepsis.  trop/ck trending down at time of
transfer to medical floor, repeat cardiac enzymes unremarkable.
 TTE showed EF>55%, E/A 0.75 on [**1-29**]. regarding rythym, pt with
increased ventricular ectopy starting [**1-29**], and noted to have
transient self-limited episodes of bradycardia to the 30's. TTE
performed which was unremarkable, sinus tachycardia was
attributed to pt's PEs, and EP consult was obtained to evaluate
bradycardia, which were felt to be vagal (gradual slowing
observed on telemetry), and not requiring intervention as they
were asymptomatic.  regarding pump function, pt initially
frankly volume overloaded, however he autodiuresed without
intervention, and was felt to be euvolemic upon discharge.  pt
discharged on aspirin and zocor for hyperlipidemia.
.
.
# HTN: pt without history of HTN, but intermittently noted to
have elevated SBPs (150's) after extubation, possibly related to
mobilization of fluid.  Upon arrival to the medical floor, his
SBPs were well controlled without initiation of antihypertensive
meds.
.
.
# Ileus vs SBO: On admission, CT Abd showed large amt of stool
in colon.  Surgery was consulted but no surgical intervention
indicated.  Pt arrived on the medical service without abdominal
complants, and +BM, with normoactive bowel sounds.
.
.
# ARF/UTI: pt presented with cre 2.2 on admission, felt likely
to be pre-renal in the setting of hypotension.  pt with h/o
recurrent urosepsis, s/p course of cefepime which would have
covered enterococcus UTI, surveillance culture ngtd.  Creatinine
stable s/p CTA (1.2->1.0, pt received mucomyst and hydration).
Pt was aggressively autodiuresing s/p CTA, likely mobilizing
fluid given during initial resuscitation, and on [**1-31**] was felt
to be euvolemic.  He was encouraged to remain well hydrated upon
discharge and to match his urinary losses with oral hydration.
Pt has a chronic indwelling foley catheter which was last
changed 1 month earlier per NH, as such, his foley was replaced
on [**2131-1-31**].
.
.
# FEN:  Given pt's acute presentation s/p aspiration event,
there was considerable concern regarding his ability to eat
unsupervised upon discharge.  pt initially fed via post-pyloric
feeding tube which pt removed on [**1-29**].  pt evaluated by the
speech & swallow service who recommended: ""ground solids & thin
liquids diet by single cup sip only, NO STRAWS!! No Mixed
consistencies like cold cereal w/milk or chicken soup w/liquid
and solids together. Medications crushed in puree.  Strict
Aspiration Precautions.  PT MUST BE FED BY STAFF.  Remind him to
eat & drink SLOWLY and no Talking w/food/liquid in his mouth.
Single cup sips of thin liquid, NO STRAWS.  Hold liquid in mouth
& keep head level (don't look up or throw head back when
drinking) Alternate between bites and sips.  If he coughs while
drinking, downgrade his diet to Nectar-Thick liquids. If he has
any signs of coughing or choking on ground solids, downgrade to
Pureed foods. If he does well w/ground solids, consider
upgrading to soft solids while carefully alternating between
bites and sips.""   Pt discharged home with instructions to
follow above instructions.  Should he develop recurrent coughing
with meals, he will follow-up with his PCP.
.
.
# DISPO:
Pt discharged to his nursing home on [**2131-1-31**], with instructions
to complete a course of vanco/zosyn (last day [**2131-2-5**]) via PICC
line.  On [**2131-2-5**], he will contact his PCP regarding removal of
PICC line.  He was instructed to take lovenox injections twice
daily, and have his INR checked daily and sent to  his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
will adjust his INR as appropriate.  he was instructed to
discontinue lovenox injections once his INR was at goal (INR
[**2-10**]) or as instructed by his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] plan was discussed with
pt's  PCP (dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]) who is aware and amenable to this

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 62 yoF w/ a h/o multiple sclerosis x 28 years now
quadraplegic and bedbound who presented to [**Hospital3 **]Hospital with shortness of breath. Patient began to notice
shortness of breath beginning 4 days prior to presentation. She
denies any chest pain, subjective fevers, chills, or night
sweats. Denies any cough, nasal congestion, sputum, hemoptysis,
weight loss, palpitations. No worsening of her chronic lower
extremity swelling and no lower extremity discomfort. No prior
history of heart disease. On presentation, she did note a
sensation of chest heaviness over the last 4 days. Denies any
nausea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.
.
Of note, at baseline, she does have some difficulty breathing
while laying flat and wears O2 at night but has never had a
formal sleep study. No PND. She noted steady progression of her
symptoms over the 4 days PTA. In the past she has required
hospitalization for respiratory distress in the setting of URIs,
however she had not been hospitalized for 3 years prior to this.
She has never required intubation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital3 17031**], VS 97.4, 117, 156/68, 24, 85%
on 3LNC. Patient reported to have made 1600 cc or UOP following
lasix in route to ED. Exam was significant for moderate
respiratory distress and decreased BS over R lung fields. CXR
was obtained showing what was thought to be a large R sided
pleural effusion. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. ABG was
7.42/45/53/29 on 3LNC. Patient placed on 50% ventimask w/ O2
sats increasing to 94% and improvement in SOB. BNP was normal at
68. D-dimer was mildly elevated at 524. First set of cardiac
enzymes were negative. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
potential thoracentesis and intensive care monitoring.
.
In transit, patient O2 sats remained 87-92% on 50% ventimask.
HRs remained tachycardic in 120s. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], O2 sats
high 80s on 50% ventimask --> mid 90s on NRB.
.
She was admitted to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
her respiratory distress. During her course there, she underwent
TTE which showed preserved LVEF, no significant valvular dz and
no intracardiac shunt. A CTA chest was obtained out of concern
for PE which was negative for PE, but did show extensive mucoid
impaction in the distal trachea and the lower lobe bronchi with
complete collapse of the right lower lobe and segmental collapse
of the left lower lobe. Thus, she underwent aggressive pulmonary
toilet with chest vest and deep suctioning with significant
improvement in her O2 sats so that she is maintaining O2 sats on
2.5L NC prior to transfer to the floor. She reports she is
nearly back to her respiratory baseline.

Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with quadriplegia secondary to multple
sclerosis with poor peripheral IV access
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Pls place PICC for access
PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed.
The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**] performed the procedure.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], the Attending Radiologist, was present and
supervised the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a single-lumen PICC line measuring 45 cm in length
was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.
The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
4 French single-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 45 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with chronic multiple sclerosis, bedbound p/w
4 days increasing SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PE, eval for anatomic cause of elevated R hemidiaphragm

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 62-year-old female with chronic multiple sclerosis, bed
bound now presenting with 4 days of increasing shortness of
breath to rule out a pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed without intravenous
contrast followed by CT of the chest post-administration of
intravenous contrast, reconstructions were performed in the
axial, sagittal and coronal planes.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph of [**2197-12-22**].

FINDINGS:

CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There is a 7 mm low-attenuation focus in the left lobe of the
thyroid gland, this may be assessed further with a thyroid
ultrasound. There is atelectasis present at the lung bases with
almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe and
subsegmental collapse of the left lower lobe. There are
bronchial secretions almost completely occluded in the bronchus
intermedius and the bronchus supplying the right lower lobe.
There are secretions also present in the collapsed segments of
the left lower lobe as well as distal trachea.

There are ill-defined patchy opacities present in both lungs
likely infectious or inflammatory. There are scattered
mediastinal lymph nodes.

There is no central pulmonary embolism, however, given the
extent of lower lobe collapse, a subsegmental pulmonary embolism
cannot be excluded in the lower lobes.

There are multiple hepatic hypodensities, these are too small to
characterize and likely represent cysts and hemangiomas. There
are multiple bilateral renal hypodensities, again these are too
small to characterize and likely represent cysts.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multilevel degenerative changes
present in the spine.

CONCLUSION:

1) Extensive mucoid impaction in the distal trachea and the
lower lobe bronchi with complete collapse of the right lower
lobe and segmental collapse of the left lower lobe.

2) No central pulmonary emboli, however, given the extent of the
lobar collapse, subsegmental pulmonary emboli cannot be
excluded.

TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac shunting seen. Preserved global
biventricular systolic function. No significant valvular
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yoF w/ h/o MS, untreated breast cancer who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for worsening SOB found to extensive mucous plugging and
lobar collapse.
.
# Respiratory distress: Secondary to mucous plugging and lobar
collapse. The patient was initally admitted to the ICU for
aggressive pulmonary toilet and significantly improved in
respiratory status maintaining O2 sats on 1-2L NC which is her
baseline. Pt was continued on supplemental O2, and should wean
off oxygen during day (uses 2.5 L at night as outpatient). She
was continued on standing alb/atrovent nebs and levofloxacin
(day [**5-29**] on day of discharge). Discharged to rehabilitation
hospital for further optimization of aggressive pulmonary
toilet.
.
# UTI: evidence of UTI on OSH U/A. Here with many bacteria,
+nitrites, no leuk est, 9RBCs, 9WBCs; colonization vs true
infection. On Macrodantin suppression at home. Levofloxacin was
continued for both UTI and possible PNA for 7 days as above (day
[**5-29**] on day of discharge).
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: Quadriplegic. Has baclofen pump with only
minimal spasticity on exam.  Continued baclofen pump, po
baclofen and diazepam prn.
.
# Stage 1 breast cancer: Patient did not pursue further
treatment after biopsy. No records regarding this in our system.

CT [**2200-10-9**] IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia/Hypoxemic respiratory failure - On admission, CXR
showed no evidence of pneumonia. On [**10-13**] (HD 11), pt was noted
to be more somnolent in the afternoon by daughter with poor
sounding breath sounds. Portable CXR showed large right
perihilar opacity concerning for infection, probable right
middle and lower lobe collapse possibly due to mucus. Vancomycin
and Zosyn were started for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired
pneumonia. She was transferred from Neuro to the Medicine
service, however became hypotensive and required readmission
back to the MICU.  In the MICU, she continued to have a
progressive oxygen requirement and was placed on BiPap with
increasing support.  The patient was DNR/DNI and after a family
meeting with neurology, palliative care, social work, and
Medicine with the HCP, the decision was made to make the patient
CMO.  Bipap was removed and the patient placed on 100% NRB.  She
was given morphine PRN to keep her comfortable and passed away
quietly with her daughter at the bedside.

# Altered Mental Status - Altered mental status was initially
thought to be a metabolic encephalopathy secondary to infection
and hyponatremia. As her infection and hyponatremia were
treated, Ms. [**Known lastname 1226**] mental status did not improve. She was
only oriented to self, confused and hallucinating intervally,
which was concerning for delirium. Renal was consulted and did
not believe hyponatremia was secondary to sodium levels or that
sodium could have contributed to seizure. On HD 7, she developed
a rigid tongue, and facial and eye twitching and was not
responsive and non verbal. Neurology was consulted promptly. She
was loaded with Keppra and a 24 hour EEG demonstrated episodes
of rhythmic [**3-28**] Hz slowing in the right temporal region,
sometimes with evidence on the left as well, all indicative of
focal
electrographic seizures. CT head did not show any acute
intracranial pathology. She did not tolerate receiving MRI. She
was maintained on Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Dilantin was also
loaded and maintained at 100 mg TID. Long term EEG monitoring
demonstrated gradual improvement. She also had resolution of
facial/eye twitching and tongue protrusion episodes. She however
was still disoriented, somewhat better at times and worse at
others. Her daughter later endorsed that she had actually been
on Valium 8-10 mg QD. There was concern for a
benzodiazepine-withdrawal component to her confusion and she was
started on diazepam 4 mg QHS and lorazepam 0.5 mg Q8H. Dilantin
dose was changed to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] since free level was above 2 on
HD 11 which may have added to confusion.  After transfer bqck to
the MICU, she continued to experience waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status.  24 hour EEG was performed and showed no evidence of
seizure activity.  She was continued on dilantin, keppra, and
ativan for control of her seizures.

# Hyponatremia - Ms [**Known lastname **] presented to ICU with symptomatic
hyponatremia with likely seizure activity. Initially [**Doctor Last Name **] sodium
hypovolemic hyponatremia given underlying infection, decreased
PO intake, and overall clinical appearance. Cr low but she has
minimal muscle mass. Urine osms 360, Feurea 39% which is mixed
picture but has been fluid resuscitated already. Hypovolemia and
hyponatremia likely exacerbated by renal losses of sodium in
setting of diuretic use. She was given IV normal saline in the
ICU with slow improvement of her sodiuim.  She was transferred
to the floor on HD 4. At this time, her FeNa was >1 so she was
felt to be euvolemic with low sodium concerning for mixed
picture of SIADH and continued low solute intake. A fluid
restriction was started without improvement of her sodium and
large urine output with high urine osmoles concerning for salt
wasting. Renal was consulted who agreed with treatment regimen
and suggested adding salt tablets to her medications and her
sodium corrected to 133 on HD 8. The sodium level has been
stable since, ranging from 135-140.


# Urinary tract infection - She had 2 positive UA's, at OSH and
at [**Hospital1 18**]. Urine culture from outside hospital grew out E. coli
>100,000 colonies. She was treated with ceftriaxone for a total
of 7 days. A CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia. C. diff sent
out on [**10-5**] as pt has leukocytosis though continues to be
afebrile and was negative. Indwelling Foley catheter was changed
on [**10-7**]. Repeat UA and urine culture were sent on [**10-13**].

# Multiple sclerosis - She was continued on her home medication
regimen of baclofen and valium. On HD 8 it was discovered she
was taking half her home baclofen dose, which was 10 mg TID.
This was continued on this admission. There was concern that the
baclofen pump was malfunctioning. Pump was interrogated by
Anesthesia and found to be functioning properly at dose of 375
mcg/day. Otherwise, this is currently stable.

# Elevated troponin: Likely secondary to increased demand in
setting of hypotension. No ECG changes or chest pain to suggest
ongoing or active ischemia. Troponins trended down. She has not
had any subjective complaints of chest pain or discomfort since.

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o female with 22 years of Multiple Sclerosis, severe, non
ambulatory for 6-7 years, was admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**]
because of increased weakness and decreased blood counts.
.
Over the past three years she has had multiple admissions for MS
flares presenting with mental status changes, diffuse
quadriparesis, hypotension, and fluctuating temperatures
attributed to hypothalamic MS. She has responded to treatment
with steroids in the past. At baseline she is paraparetic with
spasticity. She also has chronic leukopenia, attributed to her
Betaseron medication. She presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED
hypothermia and was diagnosed with RLL pneumonia. She was
initially admitted to a floor unit but on admission BP dropped
to 60/p, HR 40s, T 93.7. A code was called and atropine 1mg
administered with return of SBP 120s, HR 60. In the MICU at [**Hospital1 **] she was treated for RLLL pneumonia with ten days
levofloxacin and ceftriaxone, course completed [**2120-1-7**]. Blood,
urine, and CSF cultures showed no infection. She was transiently
on dopamine gtt to maintain HR and BP. MS flare was treated with
high dose iv Solumedrol for five day course followed by steroid
taper with prednisone and continuation of Betaseron, Provigil,
as well Bromocriptine. MRI showed stable disease without active
flare. A pacemaker was placed [**2120-1-3**] for bradycardia. Course
also c/b runs of atrial flutter. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation plasmapheresis normotensive and in sinus rhythm.
She was treated with steroids for MS and a pacemaker was placed
for symptomatic bradycardia. She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
consideration of plasmapheresis.
.
She reports that she saw her neurologist for a scheduled visit,
and because of the worsening weakness, she was sent to [**Hospital3 29818**]. Her stay there was summerized above, and now she
reports some difficulty with focusing her vision, as well as
significant weakness of both her arms and legs. She denies
difficulty breathing, chest pain, headache, dysphagia,
dysarthria, facial droop, parastheisas, or bladder or bowel
incontinance. She does report one episode of right leg numbness
and coldness several days ago, which has resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
65 y/o female with progressive Multiple Sclerosis and extensive
family history of autoimmune disease, who presented with
decreased memory, bilateral lateral gaze nystagmus, upper
extremity hypotonia, motor weakness of upper and lower
extremities (much worse in lower extermities and proximally),
decreased sensation to vibration in the toes, hyporeflexia
(worse in the lower extremities), and bilateral upgoing toes.
Current weakness likely consistant with severe multiple
sclerosis flare.
.
# Multiple sclerosis flare: The patient was admitted from an OSH
for possible plasmapheresis for her MS exacerbation.  The
patient was seen by the neurology service while in the MICU.
Given that the patient has had multiple exacerbations of her MS
this year and given that her current MS flare did not appear to
be responding to pulse solumedrol, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
possible plasmapheresis.  Because of concern for autonomic
dysfunction, plasmapheresis was initially deferred given that
plasmapheresis can cause fluid shifts and hypotension.  However,
after the patient demonstrated stable blood pressures, it was
decided to pursue plasmapheresis given the severity of the
patient's weakness and lack of recovery of LE strength.  A
pheresis catheter was placed by IR.  Five treatments were
planned but the patient completed only 3.  Plasmapheresis was
stopped because of autonomic instability and because the patient
did not show significant improvement.  The patient then
underwent three IVIG treatments again with very small
improvements in strength.  She was continued on Betaseron as per
her outpatient regimen.  The patient's mental status improved
during her hospital course as did her upper extremity strength.
Her lower extremity strength was slower to recover but upon
discharge she was able to wiggle toes, move her lower
extremities slightly.  Upon discharge, she was able to do
transfers with the assistance of her husband and was discharged
with home PT. She continued on a steroid taper and will need to
complete her taper as an outpatient.
.
# Hypotension, Autonomic Dysfuction: Patient with long history
of autonomic instability [**1-12**] her multiple sclerosis which worsen
during her MS exacerbations.  At [**Hospital3 **], the patient had a
pacer placed for symptomatic bradycardia.  The patient was
continued on Midodrine and Florinef at [**Hospital1 18**].  She was
hemodynamically stable without hypotension or bradycardia.  Her
pacemaker was interrogated by the EP service who found the pacer
to be working well.  The incision site was noted to have a small
hematoma but otherwise clean and dry without evidence of
infection.
.
# Recent pneumonia: Patient was treated at [**Hospital3 **] with a
ten day course of Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and completed
this course on [**2120-1-7**].  Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], a chest xray
showed no evidence of recurrent pneumonia.  She was afebrile
during this admission and no further antibiotics were necessary.
 She had multiple sets of blood cultures during this admission
with one anaerobic culture growing enterococcus faecium.  This
was thought to be a contaminant and surveillance cultures were
negative.  A u/a and urine culture were negative.  The patient
remained afebrile during this admission.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient was found to have persistent O2 requirement
while in the MICU.  A CTA was performed and ruled out PEs.  The
patient's gradually was weaned from O2 and was on room air
shortly after transfer from the MICU.  She was on room air and
did not require oxygen after transfer from the MICU.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable, patient was continued on outpatient
Synthroid dose.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is a 74M w/DM on glyburide, renal xplant in [**2105**] [**1-26**]
hereditary nephritis, lymphoma 9ya s/p RCHOP, SCC scalp excised
in [**2120-6-23**], afib on flecainide, MS, circumcision last week who
presented to the ED w/2 days of hypoglycemia, also found to have
low BP.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is not aware of why he is in the hospital.  He is able
to describe frequent falls [**1-26**] MS which increased over [**Holiday **]
and New Years.  He denies vertigo with the falls, but does
report decreased streadiness when his blood sugars are low.  He
takes his own medications and his list is extensive as below.
.
He presented to [**Hospital 882**] hospital yesterday with mental status
changes, BG18 and hyopthermia.  His urinalysis was negative at
that time and he was sent home.  He returned w/hypoglycemia and
was thus transferred to BDIMC.  In our ED, his VS were 100.6
104/58  80  98RA w/next BP 86/50.  He was given 1L NS, 1/2A D50,
D10 drip and levofloxacin.  At the time of transfer to the CCU
under MICU service, his BP was 89/63 and FS142.
.
His ROS is notable for the falls, dysphagia to solid foods for
years, mild dysphagia, and recent GI ilness (upper and lower) of
his wife for a few weeks; he had similar symptoms for several
days two weeks ago.  While he gives some detailed history, his
answers to many questions are tangential and circumstantial, and
in response to being asked why he is here, he describes a
vacation that he took with his wife to [**Name2 (NI) **] five years ago,
and her diarrheal ilness.  His PCP reports that this is baseline
for him.  His wife reports that he takes all of his own
medications, and does not typically make mistakes.


Social History:
Lives w/his wife; performs own ADLs, never smoked.  Never IVDA.
<2 glasses wine per day.

Family History:
Mother, sister, and father died of CVAs in 60s, 60s, 78 years

Brief Hospital Course:
.
74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and
low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.  It is not clear if his
glyburide was recently increased--this could be a primary
contributor to his presentation.  He has an evident ballantitis
which could also be contributing.
.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**1-26**] glyburide in the
context of recent illness and polypharmacy.  On the evening
following admission, his blood glucose levels were maintained at
normal levels with D51/2NS gtt titrated to q1 hour fingersticks.
 Glyburide's half life is 24 hours, and in keeping with this,
hypoglycemic effect wore out within 24 hours of admission.
Subsequently blood glucose levels were >200 and the dextrose
support was discontinued.  With the resolution of hypoglycemia,
sliding scale insulin was initiated.  After transfer from the
MICU, the patient had blood sugars > 250.  He was started on low
dose glipizide prior to discharge.  Although Glipizide still has
some interaction with voriconazole, it has less interaction that
Glyburide.  The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole
for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was
not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.  The Glipizide was
started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in
the 250 range.  He will be seen by his primary care doctor
shortly after discharge for further titration of meds.
.
2) UTI- The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone which would
cover both his UTI and balantitis.  Culture results were
negative.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin.
.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent
circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.  A
swab gram stain negative.  The wound culture was found to grown
Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent
with skin floral.  The patient was continued on a topical
antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone.  Additionally, a DFA was
negative for HSV.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin
and will followup with his [**Hospital1 2025**] Urologist.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia:  Thought to be [**1-26**] drug effect of
voriconazole vs. ranitidine; however, per PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**], he has had
baseline thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned
as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks
vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient's
ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on
platelets.  Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to
112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was instructed not to take
Ranitidine anymore.  He will followup at [**Hospital1 2025**] for further
monitoring of his thrombocytopenia.
.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on
lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary
aspergillosis.
.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush
upon admission to the MICU.  He was continued on voriconazole
and nystatin S&S was added to his regimen.  He had no further
evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.
.
7) Afib/SSS- Has PPM but currently native sinus driven.  The
patient was anticoagulated with warfarin.  Flecainide was
continued as per his outpatient regimen.
.
8) S/P renal xplant- Patient was continued on his
immunosupressives, Tacrolimus.  He was continued on Bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He will followup with his renal doctor at [**Hospital3 5870**] upon discharge.

[**12-2**] RUE U/S: No right upper extremity DVT.
.
[**12-2**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable appearance
of chest since [**2126-11-18**].
.
[**12-2**] CTA Chest: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval stable appearance of bilateral nodules, and patchy
areas of consolidation within the lungs.
3. Previously noted mild splenomegaly is no longer appreciated,
possibly related to slice selection.
.
[**12-4**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low
filling pressures or tamponade. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude)
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2126-11-5**], the
pericardial effusion is now larger.
.
[**12-4**] Cath: 1.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an
elevated mean right filling pressure along with a magnified
right atrial ""x"" descent along with an attenuated ""y"" descent.
Additionally the mean right atrial
pressure approatched the PCWP.  The pericardial pressure and
waveform
matched the RA pressure and waveform.
2.  Following pericardiocentesis (removal of over 320cc of
non-bloody fluid) the pericardial pressure dropped to zero with
no
change in the right atrial pressure or cardiac output.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate pericardial tamponade.
.
[**12-5**] CXR: The patient is status post pericardiocentesis. There
is a catheter overlying the cardiac silhouette.
There is continued bilateral multifocal opacity indicating
invasive aspergillosis this patient with leukemia and
neutropenia. The previously identified pulmonary edema has been
slightly improving. There is continued small right pleural
effusion. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. No evidence of pneumothorax is identified. The right
subclavian IV catheter remains in place.
.
[**12-5**] Abd U/S: No evidence of dilatation of the bile ducts.
Unremarkable gallbladder. Echogenic right kidney suggestive of
diffuse chronic parenchymal renal disease.
.
[**12-6**] KUB: A limited portable supine AP view of the abdomen at
22:15 hours show no evidence of dilated bowel loops to suggest
intestinal obstruction. Small amount of gas is seen throughout
the colon.
.
[**12-6**] MRI Brain: IMPRESSION: This examination is slightly
limited by motion. Mild periventricular hyperintensities due to
small vessel disease. No enhancing lesions seen. Findings
discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3640**].
MRV OF THE HEAD: Normal MRV of the head.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
.
[**12-6**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
change since [**2126-10-20**].
.
[**12-6**] EEG: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to the presence
of
abnormal background rhythms in predominantly the theta frequency
range
with superimposed delta and theta frequency slowing seen
periodically in
generalized bursts. No sharp or epileptiform features were
associated
with this slowing. The findings are most consistent with an
encephalopathy. Common causes of encephalopathy include
metabolic
causes, medications, and infections. No focal or epileptiform
features
were seen.
.
[**12-6**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small
posterior pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2126-12-4**], a small consolidated effusion (posterior)
is now evident.
.
[**12-7**] CXR: No significant change in bilateral parenchymal
opacities related to pulmonary aspergillosis.
.
[**12-7**] KUB: A single supine portable abdominal film is compared
to previous examination a day ago. The abdomen appears gasless
with fecal material in left hemicolon. The linear lucencies in
the splenic flexure and descending colon is felt to be
intraluminal rather than within the wall of the colon.
The tip of the NG tube is not visualized in distal esophagus and
stomach.
.
[**12-7**] Renal U/S: No hydronephrosis or hydroureter bilaterally.
Exam of the left kidney was technically limited.
.
[**12-9**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: Unusual generalized focal FLAIR hyperintensities
and possible coincident enhancement. Although motion artifact or
possibly another unusual artifact may be responsible for the
apparent sulcal enhancement, meningitis of infectious or
neoplastic etiology should be considered in the given clinical
scenario.
.
[**12-9**] Spinal fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells.
.
[**12-9**] Bone Marrow Bx: Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy:
Markedly hypocellular bone marrow with rare maturing erythroid
precursors and interstitial eosinophilic material consistent
with post-chemotherapy aplasia.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
PERIPHERAL SMEAR
Smear quality is acceptable.
Red cells show anisopoikilocytosis with rare schistocyte.

17% bands, 7% monocytes, 2% lymphocytes, 14% basophils.
Platelet count appears decreased; giant forms are not present.
ASPIRATE SMEARS:
          Inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES
The marrow biopsy is virtually acellular (<5%) and contains only
are small clusters populated by maturing erythroid precursors.
Myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes are not seen.
The remainder of the cellularity is composed of stromal cells,
plasma cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages.
No tumor, granuloma, lymphoma, lymphoid, or aggregate is seen.
There is a small amount of interstitial eosinophilic material
consistent with prior chemotherapy.
Marrow clot section is not submitted.
Touch prep is not submitted.
SPECIAL STAINS
Iron stain is inadequate for evaluation because it does not
contain marrow spicules.
Clinical:  [**Location (un) 5622**] positive, ALL.
Gross:  The specimen is received in B+ Fixative labeled with
""[**Known lastname 62516**], [**Known firstname **]"",  the medical record number and ""MO5-659"", and
consists of a core biopsy of bone marrow measuring 1.7 cm in
length.  The specimen is entirely submitted in A.

Brief Hospital Course:
50y/o F with ALL, fever/neutropenia, and R arm pain.
.
   After treatment in the emergency department with cefepime and
vancomycin for febrile neutropenia, the patient was admitted to
the oncology service for further care.  She was continued on
cefepime and vancomycin, and the doses of her antifungal
medication for known aspergillus infection were increased.
   The patient developed a new murmur and increased dyspnea and
chest pain, and on [**12-4**] an echocardiogram revealed a
pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.  She was
transferred to the CCU for placement of a pericardial drain and
for post-procedural care.  320cc of yellow fluid was removed via
the pericardial drain.  On [**12-5**] the patient developed renal
failure.  Her ambisome dose was therefore decreased and her
voriconazole was changed to the PO formulation.  On [**12-6**] the
patien's mental status deteriorated and she became aphasic and
less interactive.  Neurology was consulted, and they were
concerned for an intracranial process vs. toxic/metabolic
etiology.  A head CT without contrast was negative for any acute
abnormality.  EEG was consistent with encephalopathy.  MRI was
negative for acute infarct, and MRA was negative for any
vascular abnormality.  An LP was done which showed an opening
pressure of 42; however, this was felt to be falsely elevated
due to patient positioning.  Laboratory studies were not
consistent with infection, and cultures were negative.  Not
enough fluid was obtained to send for cytology.
   The patient was then transferred to the ICU for further care.
 Shortly thereafter, a family meeting was held in which the
patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI.  A bone marrow
biopsy was done on [**12-9**] to determine the status of the
patient's leukemia.  The marrow was hypocellular with no
evidence of active leukemia.  The patient's mental status did
not improve, and so a repeat LP was done on [**12-9**] to confirm the
opening pressure (which was again 40) and to obtain fluid for
cytology.  (CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells.)
After the LP the patient was noted to be in severe respiratory
distress and tachycardic to the 170s.  EKG revealed sinus
tachycardia with no ischemic changes.  ABG at that time was
7.16/46/83/17.  The patient's son was [**Name (NI) 653**], and he
reiterated that he did not wish for his mother to be intubated.
The patient's son and sister came to the bedside soon thereafter
and requested that the patient be made comfortable.  Her status
was therefore changed to Comfort Measures Only and she was
started on a morphine drip for comfort.  On the morning of [**12-10**]
the patient was noted to have [**Date Range 862**] activity.  This was
treated with ativan and resolved.  The patient was then
transferred out of the ICU to the floor for further care.
   On the BMT floor she was maintained on morphine and ativan
drips that was titrated to her comfort.  On the morning after
transfer, she went into status epilepticus.  This was terminated
with 10mg of ativan given as 4mg, 4mg, and 2mg.  She was again
breathing comfortably after this intervention but expired
90minutes afterwards.  The family was [**Date Range 653**] who professed
gratitude with her care at [**Hospital1 18**] and refused autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43 year old woman with a history of seconday
progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54179**], bipolar disorder, borderline
personality disorder, and polysubstance abuse, who initially
presented with 3 seizures.  This history is obtained from her
medical records. She was seen by a care provider at home to have
3 seizures, with GTC movements. The first seizure lasted less
than 5 minutes, but she then had 2 more seizures before
regaining consciousness. There was no clear tongue biting, and
it was difficult to assess for incontinence since she has a
diaper/Foley at baseline. EMS was called, and gave her Ativan 2
mg IV x1.  At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was unresponsive. A code stroke
was called for new onset left sided weakness after the last
seizure. (of note, she has at baseline bilateral inferior limb
paresis and right hemibody paresis). NIHSS score was 26.
Physical exam showed decreased arrousal, left face and arm
weakness, and decreased reflexes in the legs (previously
documented). CTA Head showed no acute intracranial abnormality,
chronic white matter changes consistent with demyelinating
disease, and interval improvement of left frontal edema. She was
thought to most likely have a postictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis. She
was intubated. She continued to be tachycardic, so the neurology
team was concerned for status epilepticus and gave her Ativan 2
mg IV x1 and Dilantin load. She was briefly on empiric
Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and is still on Acyclovir. LP showed
opening pressure 16, protein 121, glucose 89, and WBC [**3-17**]. She
was in the ICU from [**Date range (1) 54180**], then transferred to the step down
unit.

IMAGING:
ECG ([**9-8**]): Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 146. Left axis
deviation. Possible left anterior fascicular block.
Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.

CTA Head ([**9-8**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. CTP is generally more
sensitive than CT/CTA for infarction. However, given the history
of MS, an MR is more sensitive for acute infarct.
2. Chronic white matter changes consistent with demyelinating
disease.
3. Interval improvement of left frontal edema.

EEG ([**9-9**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry
captured no clinical or electrographic seizures. EEG reflects
low amplitude diffuse slowing with overlaying fast activity
likely secondary to medications. Superimposed on almost the
entire recording is the presence of muscle artifact. At times
when muscle artifact is diminished, mixed frequency delta and
theta slowing is observed. This EEG is most consistent with a
moderate to severe encephalopathy. Common causes of
encephalopathy include medications, metabolic causes,
infections, and anoxia. If clinical suspicion for seizure
persists, another day of EEG telemetry may be beneficial to
further delineate any focal findings which may be obscured with
encephalopathies.

MRI/MRA Head ([**9-11**]): IMPRESSION:
1. New demyelinating plaques seen in the right cerebellar
hemisphere and brainstem, both of which enhance.
2. In the supratentorial white matter, there are scattered areas
of new enhancing plaques, while others have resolved when
compared to the prior examination. This is superimposed on a
background of diffuse demyelinating disease in the
supratentorial white matter.
3. Normal MRA head.

CXR ([**9-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EEG ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the left frontal and
hemispheric slowing including of the background. This suggests a
focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere. The
episode of focal faster activity in the left temporal area was
of uncertain nature. No definitely epileptiform abnormalities
were evident.

CT Head ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. No
evidence of hemorrhage. Chronic white matter changes,
considering the clinical history, most likely consistent with
demyelinating disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Seizures with Post-Ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis: The patient is a
43 year old woman with a history of secondary progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54182**], bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and
baseline bilateral lower extremity paresis who presented with 3
GTC seizures, and was then found to have new onset left sided
weakness. A code stroke was called in the ED for new onset left
sided weakness after the last seizure (of note, she has at
baseline bilateral inferior limb paresis and right hemibody
paresis). NIHSS score was 26. Physical exam on admission showed
decreased arousal, left face and arm weakness, and decreased
reflexes in the legs (previously documented). CTA on admission
showed no acute intracranial abnormality. She was intubated for
airway protection. She continued to be tachycardic, so the
neurology team was concerned for status epilepticus and gave her
Ativan 2 mg IV x1 and Dilantin load. LP showed 121 protein and
89 glucose with 2->4 WBC, fluid culture and HSV 1 and 2 were
negative. She was briefly on empiric Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin,
and Acyclovir. EEG [**Date range (1) 54183**] showed moderate to severe
encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizure. Her progressive MS
was determined to be the most likely cause of her seizures,
especially since the hyperintensities on MRI extended past the
grey-white junction. Her post-seizure left sided weakness was
determined to be [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis, and was not consistent with
a stroke. She was initially on Keppra, but this was discontinued
when she had altered mental status. She was discharged on
Trileptal 450 mg [**Hospital1 **].

2. Secondary Progressive MS: MRI Head/MRA brain showed new
demyelinating plaques in the right cerebellar hemisphere and
brainstem. It was determined that since the hyperintensities on
MRI extended past the grey-white junction, this was likely the
cause of her seizures. She was continued on [**Hospital1 54179**] weekly,
Baclofen, Oxybutynin, Seroquel, and Clonazepam. Her Topamax and
Amytriptyline were discontinued given her altered mental status.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] as an outpatient.

3. Altered Mental Status: [**Doctor Last Name 54184**] (her case worker) reported
that at baseline, she communicates, is verbally engaging, and is
aware of where she is and who's around her. She does not like to
go outside of her home since she is in a wheelchair. An aide
prepares all of her meals. She has previously been verbally
aggressive/hostile/cursing when having UTIs. While the patient
was on the Neurology floor, she continued to have altered mental
status including disorientation to place and date, and
uncooperativity with the physical exam. CT Head showed no acute
intracranial abnormality. CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process. Repeat EEG showed left frontal and hemispheric slowing
including of the background suggesting a focal subcortical
dysfunction in the left hemisphere. However, there were no
definitely epileptiform abnormalities evident. Urine culture did
show Acinetobacter baumanni complex, so she was treated with
Bactrim for a 10 day course. Her Keppra, Topamax, and
Amytriptyline were discontinued as these may have been
contributing to her encephalopathy. Her change in mental statue
was attributed to UTI and medications; but this may also be a
new baseline for her given the progressive nature of her MS.

4. UTI: Urine culture on [**9-12**] showed no growth. However, a UA and
urine culture were rechecked on [**9-19**] for her persistent altered
mental status, which showed UA: sm leuk, neg nitr, 18 WBC, few
bact. Urine culture grew Acinetobacter baumannii complex. She
has an indwelling catheter, and we elected to treat her with
Bactrim [**Hospital1 **] x10 days.

5. Communication/Dispo: The team spoke multiple times during the
hospitalization with the patient's Mom [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54185**] [**Name (NI) 54186**])
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 54187**], Dad [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) **]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54188**], case worker
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54189**], and her personal attendant
([**Doctor First Name **]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54190**]. The patient has no HCP, and she is her
own guardian. PT recommended that she be sent home with a 24
hour caregiver ([**Name (NI) **]). Nutrition had recommended that the
patient take in more food at home, and [**Doctor First Name **] indicated that
she would prepare the patient's food and supervise and feed her
during meals.

sutures removed by his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] returned for a wound check on
[**7-3**] and was found to have a left sided wound infection, and was
admitted for a removal and washout of the distal left IPG and
connecting wire on [**7-5**].  The left sided electrode was left in
place.  He was discharged on Nafcillin and Keflex, which was
completed [**7-21**] and was to transition to po antibiotics
subsequently.

The patient gives a limited history but per his mother, the
patient was in good health until [**Month/Day (4) 766**] [**7-20**], when he was found
to have an infected left PICC which was removed.  He had a PIV
placed in his right arm which became significantly swollen and
erythematous per his mother.  The IV was removed on [**7-21**] and a
right PICC was placed in the same arm at that time, which was
reportedly difficult to place due to the swelling in his arm.
The patient's mother reports that the patient began having
fevers to 106.5 and rigors later that day and she called his ID
fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6137**].  She then brought the patient to [**Hospital 41128**]
Hospital in [**State 1727**].

The patient denies other complaints including headache, vision
changes, cough, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash,
myalgias or arthralgias.  The patient denies swelling or pain at
his right and left DBS incision sites.

At [**Hospital 41128**] Hospital, the patient was found to be hypotensive
despite 3L IVF and Neosynephrine, and he was started on
Levophed.  Cultures were drawn and he was given Vanc, Zosyn, and
Ceftriaxone.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: 100.4, 86, 65/47, 19, 99% on 2L
The patient was A&Ox3.  Neurosurgery was consulted, and felt the
wound site was unconcerning and recommended obtaining head CT
with and without contrast to r/o infection.  Blood and urine
cultures were drawn and CXR was obtained, and femoral CVL was
placed.  He received a total of 8L NS and was on Levophed 0.15
mcg/kg/hr with SBP 110's.  He spiked to 102.3 while in the ED
and was given Tylenol.  Transfer VS:  111, 23, 126/66, Levo at
0.12, 96% RA.

In the MICU, the patient denied any symptoms including headache,
n/v, abdominal change, or pain different from his typical
chronic total body pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] is a 21-year-old male with PMH of depression,
substance abuse, and DYT1 genetic dystonia, with a deep brain
pallidal stimulator (DBS) placed at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2130**], who was admitted
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**2133-7-22**] from an OSH in [**State 1727**] with sepsis
and positive OSH blood cultures from [**2133-7-21**] growing C. albicans
and Clostridial species. Prior to this admission, he was
admitted to the OSH from [**Date range (1) 76141**] with a pocket infection of
his infraclavicular L DBS battery. The battery was removed, but
the wire tracking to his brain was left in place given the high
risk of removal. He was discharged on a two week course of
nafcillin with a PICC line in place, which ultimately became
blocked. He was readmitted to the OSH on [**7-13**], where PICC line
placement was attempted once again. On discharge, he then
developed asymptomatic low grade temperatures of 101 for three
days, and on [**7-17**] developed a fever of 103.
.
On [**2133-7-21**], Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] had finished the course of nafcillin, but
developed fever to 105.5 and was taken to ED in [**State 1727**], where he
was found to be febrile to 106 with rigors. Once cultures were
drawn, he was given Vancomycin, Zosyn, and CTX and sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
1. Polymicrobial Sepsis:  Patient present with fever to 106,
hypotension and blood cultures positive for GPR ([**2133-7-21**]) and C.
albicans ([**2133-7-22**]).  Source of polymicrobial infection was
uncertain, but most likely etiology was felt to be the PICC line
placed for treatment of MSSA battery pocket infection. Full
infectious work-up, including CT/ MRI head, TTE and TEE, RUE
U/S, ophthalmologic exam, urinalysis showed no nidus of
infection or evidence of septic emboli. Both his right PICC line
and femoral line (placed in the ED for volume resuscitation)
showed cultures with no significant growth. His chest CT was
notable for question of multifocal pneumonia vs volume overload
in setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  After initial
volume resuscitation, patient remained hemodynamically stable,
with no pressor requirements.  Daily surveillance blood cultures
remained negative.  Infectious disease followed Mr. [**Known lastname 17365**]
hospital course and guided antibiotic therapy.
.
Upon transfer out of the MICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] was initially started
on PCN 4 Million Units IV Q4H, Linezolid 600 mg PO Q12, and
Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24H on [**2133-7-22**]. When cultures speciated
showing C. albicans, he began therapy with Fluconazole 400 mg
Q24h on [**2133-7-26**] and will be continuing this regimen until
[**2133-8-19**] for a four week total course. The GPR initially showed
resistance to PCN, which was thereby discontinued. As per ID
recommendations, he will continue a two week course of linezolid
on the same dose until [**2133-8-5**]. Repeat chest x-ray on [**2133-7-27**]
showed resolution of the bilateral pulmonary opacities seen on
admission. He remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile
throughout his post-MICU course until discharge.
.
2. DYT1 generalized dystonia s/p bilateral DBS: History of
generalized dystonia secondary to DYT1 genotype.  Symptoms have
been poorly managed despite maximal medical therapy and
bilateral deep brain stimulator placement. Of note, patient had
recently been admitted for MSSA battery pocket infection s/p
naficillin.  CT head and subsequent MRI showed no evidence of
infection.  Neurology was also consulted for management of
movement disorder and recommended continued treatment with
artane, ativan and oxycodone. Increased severity of symptoms and
pain noted by Neurology following removal of the L DBS battery
after infection. Further plans for possible L IPG revision after
clearing of infection to be discussed with Neurosurgery.
.
3. Acute Renal Failure:  In the MICU, patient was admitted with
creatinine of 2.1 up from his baseline of 1.0, likely secondary
to hypoperfusion from sepsis.  With volume resuscitation and
treatment of sepsis, Cr improved to 0.8 and remained stable
throughout the rest of his hospital course.
.
4. Bradycardia: Following intial resolution of sepsis with
tachycardia, the patient was notably bradycardiac, with HR
dropping to 40 - 50s. He denied SOB, chest pain, or complaints
of dizziness and remained asymptomatic through this episode. His
DBS was shut off, and EKG showed sinus pause with no evidence of
heart block.  Rarely implantation of DBS has been associated
with vagal nerve stimulation and bradycardia, but his is a
pallidal stimulator, making that a very rare potential cause.
Patient remained asymptomatic, with HR ranging from 40-50 while
on the Medicine service, which did not warrant additional
workup. He was regularly monitored, but did not require
placement on telemetry since transfer out of the MICU.
.
5. Elevated LFTs:  Mildly abnormal LFTs (ALT 34, AST 53, LDH
262, AlkPhos 343, Tbili 0.9) observed on ICU admission, which
was thought to be in the setting of sepsis and hypoperfusion.
Resolved during his hospital course.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] ICU
with a severe infection ultimately found to be both a bacteria
and a fungus which we think came from your prior PICC line. You
were given a large amount of IV fluids initially as well as
medications to support your blood pressure. You were also given
antibiotics and antifungal medications and the infectious
disease service saw you in consult to help with your infection
management. The neurology and neurosurical services also saw you
to help with the management of your dystonia and to evaluate if
your deep brain stimulators were infected. An MRI of your head
showed no infection of your deep brain stimulators and a CT scan
of your abdomen showed no infection there. You received an
ultra-sound of your heart to make sure your hear valves were not
infected. You improved with the above treatments and were
ultimately transitioned to oral antibiotics for your infection.
When you blood counts normalized you were deemed safe to send
home to complete your antibiotic pills as an outpatient.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1) Start Linezolid 600mg by mouth twice each day for 6 more days
(finish on the evening of [**2133-8-5**])
2) start Fluconazole 400mg by mouth once each day for 20 more
days )finish on the evening of [**2133-8-19**])
3) Continue your other home medications

You should follow-up with your PCP and Infectious Disease as
noted below. Since you will be on new antibiotics, please be
aware for any symptoms of a drug reaction (rash, itching,
fevers, swelling of face or hands). Your PCP with check your
blood count in [**3-19**] weeks (CBC with differential) to evaluate for
this (increased numbers of cells called eosinophils) as well as
persistance of ""band"" forms. If these persist you may benefit
from an outpaitent visit with a hematologist. Your PCP should
also perform an imaging test to evaluate your spleen in [**3-19**]
months beacuse it was noted to be enlarge on the CT scans from
this admission.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] is a 17 yo right handed girl with childhood onset
relapsing MS referred here for urgent LP per IR from Dr. [**Name (NI) 58349**] clinic for positional but persistent HA without visual
disturbance concerning for increased ICP from infectious process
or pseudotumor cerebri.
.
Per records, given that patient refused to give hx, patient
reported persistent, positional HA to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] on [**10-10**] that
interfered with sleep.  She denied any nausea/vomiting or visual
disturbance and was still on prednisone taper 10mg daily.  The
steroids were stopped per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] on [**10-10**] then patient appears
to have presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-12**] with 2 seizures (R arm
extension then head thrown back with followed by generalized
convulsion for ~ 1 minute) with EEG showing mainly L sided
discharges.  Because she refused to be admitted, patient was
started on Dilantin then discharged with prescription which was
promptly thrown away per Mom.  Open MRI at outside facility was
arranged per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10208**] but patient aborted the study in 5
minutes due to anxiety.  With some police and legal assistance,
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] and had MRI under sedation on
[**10-17**] which showed a new T2/FLAIR lesion in the R superior-lateral
pons near trigeminal root entry and also question of enhancement
of left meninges. Although ID was consulted, patient was
clinically stable, hence further work-up was deferred and
patient was discharged with Keppra to be increased from 500 to
1000mg at bedtime in 1 week.
.
Given the hx of questions meningeal enhancement and persistent
positional headache in a patient with recent high dose steroids,
infectious process was suspected hence Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] recommended
urgent LP under IR to rule out increased ICP and CNS infection.
.
As for her prior demyelinating disorder, patient developed
bilateral leg weakness followed by R eye vision loss after 2
weeks of URI symptoms and high fever back in [**5-13**].  Upon
admission to [**Hospital1 **], she was diagnosed with ADEM and treated
with IVMP for 5 days.  She improved significantly but was
readmitted on [**6-12**] after recurrence of vision loss in R eye and
repeat imaging showed new lesions hence had another 5 day course
of IVMP.  Then in [**7-13**], she presented with vague visual
complaints and found to have LUQ field cut and MRI showing
lesions in bilateral occipital lobes with brainstem lesions
hence received another 5 days of IVMP.  In [**9-12**], she was
readmitted for vision loss and APD that recovered with another
course of IVMP.  Then in [**7-18**], patient again had decreased
vision with pain in R eye hence received 3 days of IVMP with
oral steroid taper.  She was also treated with Avonex from [**9-12**]
through [**2-16**] as weekly injections but discontinued due to
depression.
.
She had earlier been evaluated at [**Hospital3 14659**] as well where Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58350**] believed that she has an NMO spectrum disorder
although Ab negative with absent myelopathy and good visual
recovery.  He also advised considering prolonged steroid
treatment of 9 months co-administered with either CellCept or
Imuran.
.
Patient on admission was very upset that she had been told to
lay flat for 1 hr after LP hence would like to be discharged.
However, upon reassuring that she will be moved to a more
comfortable bed soon and that she needs treatment until
infections has been rule out, she was willing to stay, although
she was only semi-cooperative with the exam.

>>IMAGING<<
MRI/MRV Head [**2180-10-24**]:
1. Motion-limited study with particularly limited postcontrast
images.
2. Confluent symmetric high T2 signal in the posterior body and
splenium of the corpus callosum, without mass effect or obvious
contrast enhancement. Smaller T2 hyperintensities in the
supratentorial white matter and in the pons. While nonspecific,
these findings are compatible with demyelination, which could be
due to multiple sclerosis, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, or other
etiologies. Vasculitis could also be considered.
3. Nonvisualization of flow in the right transverse sinus could
be related to its nondominant status and motion artifact. If
there is a persistent clinical concern for thrombosis of the
right transverse sinus, then further evaluation could be
performed by a CT venogram.
.
EEG [**2180-10-22**]: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to
persistent left focal theta/delta slowing and sharp transients
phase reversing in the right parasagittal central regions. These
findings suggest a deep abnormality affecting projections to the
left hemisphere and a possible focus of cortical irritability in
the right central parasagittal region. There were no
electrographic seizures in the record.
.
EEG [**2180-10-26**]: This EEG monitoring captured 13 pushbutton
activations for clinical events that did not have any EEG
correlate of epileptiform activity. There was no ictal or
interictal epileptiform activity. The background activity was
slow some of the time suggestive of a mild encephalopathy with
slower activity seen sometimes more over the left than the right
hemisphere suggestive of a deep subcortical dysfunction more in
the left than the right hemisphere.
.
EEG [**2180-10-27**]: This telemetry captured 26 pushbutton activations
for several seconds of repetitively bending forward and
backwards when sitting in a chair or laying down in bed with no
epileptiform activity seen during these events. There was no
ictal or interictal epileptiform activity seen during this
recording. The background activity was diffusely slow, more so
over the left than the right hemisphere. In addition, the
background activity was not well-sustained bilaterally.
.
EEG [**2180-10-28**]: This telemetry captured 42 pushbutton activations
for different events of shaking, unresponsiveness, and blinking.
Most of them were not correlated with any change in the
background behavior; however, a few of them were correlated with
some more rhythmic delta activity seen predominantly over the
left fronto-temporal area. Similar rhythmic activity was also
sometimes captured by the automatic seizure detection programs,
not always with a clear clinical correlate. The background
activity was slow with slower activity seen over the left than
the right hemisphere.
.
EEG [**2180-10-29**]: This telemetry captured 20 pushbutton activations
for different events of agitation and shaking with no clear EEG
correlate. The background activity was slow with slower activity
seen over the left than the right hemisphere. In addition, there
were runs of more rhythmic 2.5 Hz activity seen predominantly
over the left fronto-temporal area and sometimes with no
clinical correlate. This rhythmic activity could represent
ongoing electrographic seizures.
.
EEG [**2180-10-30**]: This telemetry captured 10 pushbutton activations
for different episodes of posturing, agitation, shaking, and
blinking with no clear EEG correlate; however, with the EEG,
there were several runs of rhythmic delta activity seen
predominantly in the left fronto-temporal area lasting for up to
20 seconds and suggestive of electrographic seizure activity.
The background activity was slow with slower frequencies seen
over the left than right hemisphere.
.
EEF [**2180-11-9**]: This telemetry captured six pushbuttons as
described above. During portions of the routine, seizure and
pushbutton files, there are periods of rhythmic delta activity,
left frontal greater than right, that appear to evolve and are
suggestive of possible epileptiform activity. On at least one
occasion, this occurred following an episode of facial
twitching. Although there are no clear spike wave discharges on
this recording, the periods of rhythmic left frontal predominant
delta activity are suspicious for epileptiform discharges.
Overall, the background is very disorganized, consisting of a
[**3-14**] Hz delta activity with slowing more prominent on the left
hemisphere.
.
EEG [**2180-11-29**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the background rhythm with delta slowing in
the left temporal region and asymmetry of spindle activity which
is more pronounced in the left parasagittal to central regions.
These findings are consistent with a severe encephalopathy with
possible subcortical dysfunction in the left temporal region.
The asymmetry of the spindle activity may reflect a breach
artifact in the left parasagittal to central regions. There were
no electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
.
EEG [**2180-12-18**]:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: There was excessive focal slowing in the [**5-15**] Hz
range in the left fronto-central region. The background in this
area was also very irregular and mildly sharp.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were a few bursts of bifrontal paroxysmal
theta with sharp features.
BACKGROUND: Appeared to represent drowsiness in early sleep.
There was no normal waking background activity.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain drowsy or in early sleep
throughout most of the recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular tachycardia with a
rate of approximately 110.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG, largely in drowsiness, due to the left
frontal theta slowing and due to the infrequent bursts of
bifrontal theta with some sharp features. The first abnormality
suggests a focal dysfunction in the left anterior quadrant, but
it cannot specify the etiology. The irregular sharp background
in the same area suggests the presence of a skull defect at some
point. The bursts of focal slowing were paroxysmal and had some
sharp features raising concern for epileptogenesis, but there
were no definitely epileptiform abnormalities in this recording.
There were no electrographic seizures. A tachycardia was noted.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON [**2180-11-3**]: Widespread bilateral pulmonary
emboli. Mild dilatation of the main pulmonary artery is
compatible with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure.
.
MRI Spine [**2180-11-14**]:
1. No definite evidence for intramedullary abnormal enhancement
or abnormal T2 hyperintensity to suggest multiple sclerosis
plaques.
2. Left psoas muscles and right posterior paraspinal muscle
fluid-fluid levels, likely represent intramuscular hematomas
with surrounding inflammation of the muscles. In presence of
signs of infection, hemorrhagic abcesses cannot be excluded.
3. New large cystic lesion within the perisplenic region,
incompletely characterized on this examination. This can
represent the stomach, however, cystic lesion other than this
cannot be excluded. CT scan of the abdomen is recommended.
4. New right upper lobe opacification. Differential diagnostic
considerations would include right upper lobe atelectasis or
pneumonia. Given the acuity of this lesion, mass lesion is
unlikely. Right basilar lower lobe segmental dependent
atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.CT
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2180-11-16**]): Cystic structure as seen on MR
examination from [**2180-3-17**] can be correlated to the fundus of the
stomach. Left psoas hematoma with small focus of active
extravasation. Hemorrhage tracking down left paracolic gutter
with small amount of pelvic hematoma. No discrete fluid
collections that would be concerning for abscess
formation.
.
CT Head ([**2180-11-17**]): No acute hemorrhage. Diffuse hypoattenuation
of the subcortical white matter, in particular posterior to the
lateral ventricles, consistent with overlying disease seen on
the prior MRI study. Slightly prominent ventricles for patient
age, unchanged from MRI exam
.
CT HEAD ([**2180-11-23**]) s/p biopsy:
FINDINGS: Left-sided craniotomy defect subcutaneous and small
amount of pneumocephalus is new since prior exam. No large
intracranial hemorrhage is seen. There is no mass effect or
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, abnormality. Left inferior
basal ganglia sub-cm hypodensity likely represents a dilated
Virchow -[**Doctor First Name **] space. The visualized ventricles and extra-axial
spaces are within normal limits. Pneumocephalus in the left
frontoparietal region is seen, this likely represents the site
of biopsy. There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Pneumocephalus and post-surgical changes related to
recent biopsy. No large intracranial hemorrhage.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT ([**2180-11-28**]):
HISTORY: Left upper extremity swelling with PICC line in place.
FINDINGS: There is non-compressibility as well as echogenic
thrombus filling the left axillary vein and both brachial veins.
Thrombus surrounds the PICC line in one of the brachial veins.
There is normal flow and waveforms in the bilateral subclavian
veins. The left internal jugular, basilic, and cephalic veins
are patent.
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis of the left axillary and both left
brachial veins.
.




Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 58354**] is an 18 year old female with MS/NMO spectrum who
initially presented with headache, who then had a prolonged
hospitalization with evidence of severe encephalitis, as
described in detail below.

LEUKOENCEPHALITIS: When initially being evaluated for the
headache, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture (see results
section).  She was started on a course of acyclovir which was
discontinued when CSF HSV was negative.  She underwent MRI/MRV
of the head which showed demyelination but did not demonstrate
venous sinus thrombosis.  There was also concern that her
presentation could have been consistent with seizures. On
admission she was continued on Keppra and was also started on
Zonegran.  Keppra was eventually weaned due to concerns that it
could be exacerbating the behavioral problems. She had several
EEGs which showed non specific delta slowing that was not
clearly epileptic. MRI showed evidence of demyelination, as
above.
.
Patient became inceasingly non-verbal, disinhibited, and
disoriented over the course of her hospitalization. A host of
serum and CSF labs were obtained evaluating for various
infectious, immunologic, paraneoplastic,and rheumatologic
sources of her condition, however, work up was pan-negative(see
results section).
.
LPs showed a lymphocytic predominance but no organisms were ever
isolated. Dilantin ([**2180-10-31**]) was added to the zonisamide for
question of seizure and worsening encephalopathy. ID was
consulted [**11-1**] and recommended WNV, EEE, Cryptococcal, Toxo,
Lyme Ehrlichiosis, Bartenella,histoplasma, HH6 and CSF culture
which were negative (see results). HIV serum [**Month/Year (2) 41770**] test was
negative. Patient began to have stereotyped facial twiches and
UE stiffening that was concerning for seizure although this was
never clear. She was empirically started on solumedrol but her
metal status continued to decline. She became non verbal and not
responsive to noxious stimulus. But, she continued to
intermittently developed facial twiching and UE tremors
concerning for seizure. [**11-10**] Clonazepam started for rhythmic
delta slowing on EEG. It became unclear whether her worsening
mental status was related to her history of demyelinating
disorder or a new process.  A brain biopsy was obtained on [**11-22**]
which showed leukoencephalitis but was otherwise negative.
Additional samples from the brain biopsy were sent to the [**Hospital1 **] for additional research. Serum was sent to the [**Last Name (un) 58355**] lab
at [**State 43840**] for examination for anti-NMDA
receptor antibodies, a paraneoplastic syndrome.
.
On [**12-1**] she showed dramatic improvement, and was much more
alert and interactive, talking in sentences. After having pulled
out her NG tube (below), she underwent a swallow evaluation and
was started on soft diet. She had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] levels of
alertness and interaction, but gradually advanced her diet and
became on average somewhat more interactive in the last week of
[**Month (only) 359**] and first week of [**Month (only) **]. Of note, by [**Month (only) **] she was
eating very vigorously and quickly, grabbing at food in front of
her.
.
In terms of her behavior, it was difficult to tell the various
contributions to the patient's behavior of encephalopathy, a
possible underlying psychiatric condition, or medications.
Overall, encephalopathy was likely the biggest contributor;
taken as a whole, her behaviors could be globally described as
consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction, with poor ability to
initiate positive behaviors other than grabbing at food, and
poor ability to process information, but a clear ability to
comprehend and respond to language as well as to react to
stimuli and defend herself against perceived threats. On mental
status exam she appeared confused and disoriented. Psychiatry
was consulted and followed her during the admission. Initially
the patient was placed on ativan/Zyprexa PRN.  Standing Zyprexa
was then added.  However, the patient developed progressively
worsening encephalopathy but with continued behavioral
outbursts.
.
At that point, ativan was discontinued and Zyprexa was given
PO/IM for behavioral outbursts. Keppra was also tapered off, as
above. She was put on dilantin for seizure control. In the
longer run, psychiatry suggested that Depakote or Trileptal
might be better choices for seizure medicines in the setting of
her behavioral issues, but a transition was deferred for
outpatient follow-up or rehab monitoring, with an imminent
transfer to rehab in mind. Psychiatry also suggested
anti-psychotics, but the patient's mother was quite concerned
about an earlier phase of the patient's admission in which she
felt that a decline in the patient's function was associated
with Zyprexa, and asked that the team not administer these
medications. Active discussion with the mother on this topic
continued, although the team did not insist on this given the
appearance of slow gradual albeit not dramatic improvement in
the patient's mental status. Pre-medication with small doses of
IM ativan was tried for physical therapy activities; it was
difficult to tell how helpful this was, and was undertaken with
the understanding of a risk of further disinhibition. Further
work on behavioral strategies will surely be an important part
of her rehabilitation stay.
.
MICU STAY s/p BRAIN BIOPSY:
She was transferred to the MICU s/p brain biopsy on [**11-23**] [**3-13**]
difficulty with extubation.  Ms [**Known lastname 58354**] remained intubated
overnight, in the morning her sedation was weaned and ventilator
decreased to PSV intermittnatly.  In the evening, she was
successfully extubated.  She was monitored overnight and was
tachypnic and tachycardic, but breathing comfortably and
maintained O2 sats in the high 90s on RA. She was ultimately
transferred back to the floor where she remained thereafter.
.
TACHYCARDIA AND HYPERTENSION: Patient was admitted with a low
grade tachycardia 90s-100s and elevated BPs. She was eventually
found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli.  An EKG, ECHO, and
cardiac enzymes were obtained, which were within normal limits.
Patient subsequently developed hypertensive episodes to 150-180
and captopril was started on [**11-7**] for BPS <130. She was started
on metoprolol later in [**Month (only) 359**]; then discontinued and replaced
with lisinopril to see if this would improve hypertension;
unfortunately, she then had systolic blood pressures to the 180s
and became tachycardic to the 120s-130s; metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] was
restarted on [**12-13**] and blood pressures became mildly hypertensive
and heart rates came down to 100s-110s. Toradol was tried as a
trial to see if pain was driving these vital signs but seemed to
have little effect. A lovenox level was checked and was within
therapeutic range.
.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: On [**11-2**], a PE-protocol CT scan was obtained
to evaluate for persistent tachycardia and tachypnea. She was
found to widespread bilateral PEs and heparin gtt was started.
She was eventually transitioned to lovenox. She had good
oxygenation though her tachycardia persisted. She had some
difficulty with extubation after her brain biopsy but was
extubated after an overnight stay in the MICU and soon after was
having room air oxygen saturations in the high 90s. Later in her
stay, a Factor Xa level was ordered to evaluate her lovenox
level and showed this was therapeutic as of [**12-14**].
.
BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: Patient was found to have PEs as above.  She
was initially started on heparin gtt (PTT goal 60-80). However
she was then found to have a psoas hematoma on [**11-16**] after noting
a precipitous decline in her hematocrit.  She was tranfused and
hematocrit stabilized. She underwent an IR guided embolization
but imaging showed no active extravasation.  Given tenous
coagulation status, an IVC filter was considered. At that time,
bilateral LENIs were negative so it was felt she was not benefit
from the procedure. Her heparin PTT goal was decreased 50-60.
Ultimately she was transitioned to therapeutic lovenox and her
hematocrit remained stable without further evidence of bleeding.

.
FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: On hospital day 12, patient begain
spiking temperatures to 101. ID was consulted as above (see
neuro section).  She was also treated empirically for a UTI with
ceftriaxone [**11-6**] x3days. [**11-7**] she developed fever to 100.7 and a
luekocytosis WBC 17.0. She was started on vanco and zosyn
emperically.  She was subsequently found to have a coag negative
staph bacteremia.  She was treated for 2 weeks with vanco. Her
lines were pulled and replaced. She had a temperature of 100.6
on [**12-14**] and blood cultures were drawn, labs were drawn, and an
abdominal ultrasound was performed; this revealed...
.
IV ACCESS: Her initial PICC line was pulled in the setting of
her apparent line infection, and a central right IJ line was
placed. This was discontinued and ultimately replaced with a new
PICC on the left. This PICC was later found to have a left upper
extremity DVT associated with it and was pulled, and a RUE PICC
was placed. The patient then ultimately pulled this PICC line
out and it was not replaced, and in the last week of her
admission, medical care was given without IV access and labs
were drawn selectively and with the safety of phlebotomy and
nursing staff in mind.
.
CONSTIPATION: The patient developed constipation during the
hospitalization.  This was treated with standing Senna/Colace,
as well as lactulose PRN. On [**11-2**] tube feeds were started
because of worsening encephalopathy and decreased PO intake. She
did not tolerate tube feeds and pulled out her NG tube. She had
some constipation in early [**Month (only) **] which was treated with
.
HYPERGLYCEMIA: Developed episodes of hyperglycemia while on tube
feed and Solumedrol, for which she received sliding scale
insulin. This was not necessary when she was not on steroids and
she had no evidence of diabetes.
.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Multiple sclerosis/NMO spectrum, with acute leukoencephalitis of
unclear origin
Pulmonary emboli
[**Name (NI) **] staph bacteremia


Discharge Condition:
Fair


Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 58354**] had a lengthy hospital stay for a neurologic syndrome
shown by biopsy to be leukoencephalitis, but of unknown type.
Most studies are negative; a few further outside studies are
pending. Her mental status appears to be slowly improving but
further rehabilitation will be necessary. If she fails
rehabilitation, she should likely be readmitted to a neurology
service either at the [**Hospital1 18**] or another area academic tertiary
care hospital.

Followup Instructions:
NEUROLOGY FOLLOW-UP
.
She should have a follow-up appointment scheduled with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8760**] at [**Hospital1 18**] [([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11088**]] within two weeks of
being placed in rehab, to be scheduled for appropriate and safe
transport to and from rehabilitation; and then within 1-2 weeks
after discharge.
.
Lab results being followed up by [**Hospital1 18**] staff include NMDA
receptor antibodies ([**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]) and brain biopsy ([**Hospital3 14659**])
which are being evaluated by research laboratories. It is
possible if NMDA receptor is negative that an LP will need to be
performed. In her current state, this would need to be a planned
procedure likely under anesthesia, so it has been deferred given
that anesthesia has possibly contributed to over sedation and
encephalopathy post-procedure earlier in her course.
.
PRIMARY CARE
.
She should have a primary care appointment made for her to be
attended within one week of discharge from the rehabilitation
facility. She should make a transition from pediatric to adult
care.
.
To facilitate this transition, she should have an appointment
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1520**] in our [**Hospital 1944**] clinic as her
first post-discharge appointment. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1520**] saw Ms. [**Known lastname 58354**] as
an inpatient. She is not a primary care physician but will be
able to organize and facilitate Ms. [**Known lastname 58356**] outpatient care
immediately post-discharge. If for some reason Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1520**] is
not available, please ask for another [**Hospital 1944**] clinic
appointment at [**Hospital3 **].
.
She should then have two follow-up appointments for primary
care. She should have a final pediatric appointment with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Street Address(2) **], [**Hospital1 **],[**Numeric Identifier 58357**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 58358**]. She
should then have an adult internal medicine appointment shortly
thereafter with a physician at [**Hospital1 **]
Center's [**Hospital3 **]. Please bring Ms. [**Known lastname 58356**]
pediatric records from Dr.[**Name (NI) 58359**] office to this first
appointment. Physicians in this practice who currently have
availability include Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who we recommend as an
excellent and caring physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2772**], if Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] does not
have an appointment available, she should have another primary
care physician assigned to her. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1520**] can help with this
if it is not resolved to your satisfaction by the time of your
post-discharge appointment.
.
If there are problems with outpatient follow-up, please call Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]. Because he may not be working at

Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old female
with advanced multiple sclerosis who is bed bound and
paraplegic from her multiple sclerosis , s/p ileal
conduit who presents with a stone in her right ureteropelvic
junction which is causing right hydronephrosis.  The patient
is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital for
decompression via percutaneous nephrostomy tube.  The patient
presented to the outside hospital one day prior to admission
with fevers by report, lethargy which was noted at her
nursing home.  The patient also was complaining of diffuse
myalgias.  The patient had recently decreased p.o. intake.
She reported that she had some nausea. She had no emesis.  No
diarrhea.  No cough.  No upper respiratory symptoms.  No
complaints of headache.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital,
the patient was diagnosed with urosepsis from the
nephrolithiasis.  The patient was started on IV antibiotics
with Oxacillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl to treat a Proteus
urosepsis.  The patient was transferred here for further
management and percutaneous nephrostomy placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis, advanced (bed bound), status post
right and left nephrostomy tubes, status post ileal conduit,
status post right hydronephrosis.
2.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
3.  Question of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has lived in a nursing home for
the past three years.  She does not smoke tobacco or have a
history of smoking tobacco.  She has a history of past
alcohol use, although not abuse.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother passed away from diabetes
mellitus and uterine cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.4, blood
pressure 110/60, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 16, 94% on
room air.  General:  She was somnolent.  Her pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  They were 5 mm.  The
extraocular muscles were intact.  She was anicteric.  Neck:
Supple.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Abdomen:  Diffusely tender, increased tenderness in the right
lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.  Active bowel sounds.
She had an ostomy bag in place with cloudy urine.
Extremities:  There was 2+ pitting edema to the midcalf
bilaterally as well as in the arms bilaterally.  Neurologic:
Flaccid below the neck.  Her toes were equivocal.

LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA: On admission, the patient's
white blood cell count was noted to be 28.2, hematocrit 43.6,
platelets 339,000.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 131,
potassium 4.3, chloride 97, bicarbonate 22, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.4, and glucose 167.  Her LFTs were within normal
limits.  Albumin 3.2, calcium 8.8.  Her differential for her
white blood cell count on admission was 78% polys, 5% bands,
10% lymphocytes.  The urinalysis was notable for [**5-4**] red
blood cells, greater than 50 white blood cells, no
epithelials, many bacteria, a pH of 9, 30 protein, positive
for nitrate, and large leukocyte esterase.

The CT of the abdomen at the outside hospital showed a large
staghorn calculi at the right ureteropelvic junction with
resultant right hydronephrosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with
advanced multiple sclerosis was initially admitted to the
Medical Service for management of her urosepsis and
percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.  Post the
percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement in the right kidney,
the patient was noted to become more tachycardiac as well as
to have episodes of hypotension with her systolic blood
pressure dropping to the 80s, requiring fluid rescuciation.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intensive monitoring of her
presumed post-procedural sepsis. Antibiotic coverage was
broadened to ampicillin, Flagyl, and
gentamycin.   Multiple attempts were made to place a central line
which were unsuccessful.  On [**2150-4-13**], the patient had a PICC
placed by Interventional Radiology for IV antibiotics.

After observation in the Intensive Care Unit overnight, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred back
to the medicine [**Hospital1 **] service.   Blood cultures confirmed a
proteus and pseudomonas bacteremia, the former with multidrug
resistance. Ceftriaxone theray was chosen based on sensitivities
initially and then changed to ceftazidime for improved
pseudomonas coverage with plans for a 14 day course. At the
request of pt's private urologist, plans were made to postpone
nephrolith removal until sepsis was fully treated.

Of note, On transfer to the General Medical Floor, the patient
was noted to have a firm right upper quadrant round mass which
was not present on subsequent u/s, suggesting a this was simply a
loop of bowel containg feces.  Ultrasound did reveal diffusely
echogenic liver consistent with fatty liver, cholelithiasis, and
an ill defined desity in the right upper renal pole carresponding
to the knoen nephrolith.  MRCP was suggested to better evaluate
the liver but was impossible due to metal ureteral stents.  The
patient's urologist was aware of this evaluation.

The patient wasfelt to be malnoursihed malnourished by her
albumin which was 2.8 on admission.  She
was continued on a house diet with Boost Plus supplements
three times a day.  She should be encouraged to drink
nutritional supplements at least three times a day to attempt
to improve her nutritional status.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 29 y.o female with severe multiple sclerosis
complicated by dementia, inability to ambulate, and incontinence
who was admitted to the MICU with fevers and tachycardia one day
after being discharged from an outside hospital.  Per patient's
mother, she had intermittent fevers at her [**Hospital1 1501**] for three to four
weeks prior to presentation at the outside hospital.  These were
initially attributed to and treated as UTI and she is status
post treatment with nitrofurantoin and then levofloxacin but
continued to have fevers.  She was admitted to the outside
hospital on [**1-2**].  There, she had debridement of a sacral
decubitus ulcer with wound vac placement in the operating room
on [**1-7**], but the Infectious Disease team and vascular surgery
thought it unlikely the decubitus ulcer was the source of her
fevers.  She also had doppler ultrasounds of her lower
extremities performed to evaluate for thromboembolism, which
were negative.  She ultimately received 4 days of cefepime and 3
days of vancomycin before being changed to levofloxacin PO and
discharged back to her [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2139-1-10**].  The patient then
proceeded to spike a fever to 102.8 associated with tachycardia
to the 140's leading to transfer back to the outside hospital.
The outside hospital hospitalist requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
given that her neurologist was at [**Hospital1 18**], as no infectious cause
of fever could be determined at OSH, and there was a question of
a central neurological process.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her rectal temperature was 101.8 and she had
tachycardia to the 140s.  She received vancomycin and cefepime
as well as 1 L intravenous fluid and antipyretics.  She
continued to have fever and tachycardia, however, and was thus
admitted to the MICU.  Vitals prior to transfer from the ICU
were T101.8R, HR 134, 123/64 R16 98% RA.

Past Medical History:
- Secondarily progressive multiple sclerosis initially
presenting in [**2131**].  Complicated by dementia, affective
disorder, optic neuropathy, urinary incontinence, paraplegia.
- Hypertriglyceridemia
- Bipolar disorder
- Stage 3+ decubitus ulcers

Social History:
Patient formerly ran her own business, hosted a radio show in
[**Location (un) 3340**], and published poetry. She is a college graduate. She
has an 8 year old son who lives with her sister. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco or
alcohol use. There is a prior history of marijuana and cocaine
use.


Family History:
On the patient's mother's side there is a family history of
adult-onset diabetes.  There is a family history of breast
cancer on the patient's father's side as well as muscular
dystrophy.

RADIOLOGY:
===========
[**1-11**] CXR:
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis [**2139-1-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Sacral decubitus ulcer extending to the coccyx bone.
No other
potential source of fever identified.

MRI Pelvis on [**2139-1-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large probing soft tissue ulcer in lower back as detailed.
Abnormal
marrow edema and enhancement in coccyx compatible with
osteomyelitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Unsual pattern of diffuse muscle edema throughout much of the
the pelvis, particularly involving the bilateral gluteus medius
and maximus and obdurator externus and internus muscles, of
uncertain etiology. The ddx includes multiple etiologies for
myositis or myonecrosis. Is there any
evidence of elevated CK values? Infectious myositis cannot be
excluded on
the basis of the mri appearance.
3. Bilateral hip joint effusions.

Indium tagged WBC scan on [**2139-1-28**] (preliminary read):
Increased uptake in the sacrum and unclear uptake in paranasal
sinuses.  Otherwise unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
29F with MS, c/b dementia and paraplegia, on interferon beta
admitted with FUO, Stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and
tachycardia for further workup.

# FUO: Pt was admitted to the MICU upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] due to
her tachycardia.  Her Tmax in the MICU was 102.7.  She received
an extensive work-up to delineate the source of her fever,
including a chest x-ray, which demonstrated no acute
cardiopulmonary process, CT with evidence of sacral ulcer
extending to coccyx, unremarkable TTE, and MRI consistent with
possible osteomyelitis at coccyx.  Additionally, labs were
remarkable for elevated WBC of 16.9, elevated CK of 3162,
elevated ESR of 29, and elevated CRP of 77.1.  RF, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-Sm,
and anti-dsDNA negative.  Preliminary wound culture grew out
Staph aureus, and CSF, urine, and blood cultures all
demonstrated no growth.  CSF cryptococcal antigen was negative,
CMV titers were negative, C. diff was negative, and EBV titers
were remarkable for a past infection.  Given her elevated CK and
fever, her depakote dose was decreased due to concern for
possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  Of note, CT-guided
bone biopsy at site of presumed osteomyelitis was not possible,
per MSK radiologist, requiring a surgical bone biopsy for tissue
culture.  Per ID's recommendations, ortho was consulted to
perform this open biopsy on [**1-16**].  Biopsy culture grew GNR
(Proteus mirabilis) as well as Staph aureus.  The pt was
initiated on Pipercillin-Tazobactam on [**1-17**] and Vancomycin on
[**1-18**] for empiric, broad-spectrum coverage.  A PICC line was
placed on [**1-19**].  Given the sensitivities of her Proteus,
pipercillin-tazobactam was switched to cefriaxone/metronidazole
on [**1-19**].  The plan is to treat the patient for 6 weeks starting
from [**2139-1-16**], which should run until [**2139-2-27**].  The patient
became febrile again following her antibiotic switch, though
infectious disease strongly believed her new regimen of
ceftriaxone/metronidazole/vancomycin was adequate coverage and
the patient continued to appear better with no worsening
leukocytosis or other markers of persistent infection.  Repeat
MRI of pelvis was unchanged, but did continue to show bilateral
hip effusions and muscle edema.  Given concern these stable but
strange findings could represent infection the patient went for
tagged WBC scan.  This revealed increased uptake in the sacrum
(c/w known osteomyelitis) as well as unclear uptake in the
paranasal sinuses.  Given broad spectrum coverage, the lack of
any symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis, and the fact the
patient had actually defervesced for >24 hours by the time the
scan actually occured she was considered to be very unlikely to
have acute bacterial sinusitis.  She was discharged on a inhaled
regimen in order to help manage chronic sinusitis.

# Sinus tachycardia:  The patient had a heart rate of 150s upon
admission for which she was admitted to the ICU and started on
metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Tachycardia has been reportedly
unresponsive to IVF in the past.  Studies were negative for DVT
at the outside hospital.  Her tachycardia was presumed secondary
to fever vs a degree of central dysregulation.  As her infection
was treated, her tachycardia improved and she was never
symptomatic from this.

# Elevated CK: At admission [**Known firstname **] had a CK of 3162, concerning
for a destructive muscle process.  MRI demonstrated diffuse
muscle edema in pelvic muscles, concerning for some sort of
infectious myositis or myonecrosis.  CK was trended and
decreased appropriately over time.  Repeat MRI showed no
remarkable changes but CK had decreased to the normal range by
then.  It is plausible that the pelvic muscle edema is due to
chronic denervation. Tagged WBC scan showed no uptake in the
gluteal muscles.

# Bilateral hip effusions: The patient was found to incidentally
have bilateral hip effusions on MRI without any consistent
symptoms related to her hips.  Given the low likelihood of
bilateral septic arthritides and the fact these areas were
non-reactive on tagged WBC scan aspiration was not indicated.

# Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a Stage IV sacral decubitus
ulcer s/p debridement at the OSH, with concern for osteomyelitis
at coccyx.  Wound culture grew out MRSA and Bacteroides
fragilis.  Plastics following for wound care management.
Nutrition was consulted for optimal wound healing, and zinc and
vit C were initiated.  Wound care nursing also involved and
provided appropriate wound care instructions.

# Anemia: Hct was 36.9 at admission, and dropped to 28.5 with 6L
IVFs given in ICU upon admission.  Hct remained initially stable
but dropped to around 25, with no clinical evidence of bleeding.
 Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
and B12 and folate levels were within normal limits.  Hemolysis
labs were unremarkable.  Hct was trended and type & screen was
kept active.  Her hematocrit remained stable around 25 and she
never required transfusion.

# Multiple sclerosis:  The patient has severe relapsing and
remitting vs. secondary progressive MS.  Previously, she has
been treated with cytoxan and prednisone but this was stopped in
[**7-28**].  Prior to admission she was on interferon-B once weekly as
an outpatient.  Neurology was consulted during her
hospitalization and in discussion with her primary neurologist a
decision was made to hold off immunosuppressive therapy for now
given infection.  She was continued on oxybutynin 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for
neurogenic bladder and donepezil for dementia per home regimen.

# Bipolar disorder: Continue quetiapine, and depakote (on
decreased dosing regimen given elevated levels) per home
regimen.

# CODE:  Full code

# PPx: She was kept on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

# FEN: She was fed a full diet with Ensure supplementation

Coccygeal Osteomyelitis
Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer

Secondary -
Multiple sclerosis
Bipolar disorder
Neurogenic bladder
Anemia of chronic disease


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile for 24 hours, tolerating PO's


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for fever of unknown origin as
well as a rapid heart rate (or tachycardia).  You underwent an
extensive work-up to identify a source of the fever, including
chest x-ray; CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; MRI of
the abdomen and pelvis; as well as many labs.  The MRI indicated
an abnormal bone marrow signal that suggested a possible
infection of the bone, called osteomyelitis, near your sacral
decubitus ulcer.

You underwent an open biopsy of the bone to identify the source
of infection and were started on the antibiotics Vancomycin,
Metronidazole, and Ceftriaxone.  A special IV, called a PICC
line, was placed in your left arm for administration of these
antibiotics intravenously once you leave the hospital.  You will
need to complete multiple weeks of antibiotic treatment for this
infection.

Medication changes:
Your depakote dose was decreased from 1000 mg each morning and
1500 mg each night to 1000 mg both in the morning and at night.
Additionally, you were placed on a medication called metoprolol
(12.5 mg twice a day) for the rapid heart rate that you
developed with this infection.  You are also on the antibiotics
ceftriaxone, metronidazole and vancomycin for your infection.

Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency department
in the case of: persistent fever, worsening pain in the area of
your ulcer, or any concerns you may have.

Floor Course:
Patient was transferred from the ICU to the floor in stable
condition on POD1.  She was NPO with IVF and IV pain
medications.  On POD4 the NGT was removed after it had low
output.  On POD6 the patient passed flatus and her diet was
advanced to clear liquids.  Unfortunately, on POD7 the patient
began vomiting and her abdomen was distended.  CT scan found and
ileus with questionable small bowel in a ventral hernia.  The
patient was treated conservatively with an NGT and bowel rest.
On POD13 the patient was started on TPN due to prolonged NPO
status.  On POD15 the patient passed flatus and she was advanced
to clears.  The TPN was discontinued on POD16.  She was found to
have a swollen right arm on POD16 and an ultrasound revealed a
non-occlusive blood clot in her basilic vein where the PICC line
was present.  She will be treated with 3 months of lovenox for
this clot and follow-up with her PCP for management.  In
addition, the patient was having expiratory wheezes on POD16 and
we obtained a pulmonary consult.  They commented that the
patient was volume overloaded following TPN and she would
require gentle diuresis.  Following some diuresis the patients
breathing improved.  She will be discharged to rehab continuing
to be diuresed.  On the day of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet, her pain was well controlled and she
was having bowel movement regularly.  She will follow-up with
her PCP for management of the lovenox and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87468**] is a 53 y.o. F with a history of alcoholic
[**Known lastname 87469**] admitted from OSH for epidural hematoma vs abscess.
Around 10 days ago, pt was in the garden weeding when her foot
fell into a ditch. She then fell on her buttox. Ever since the
fall, she has had increasing pain in her neck, along her
vertebrae, shoulders, and bilateral groin. She also reports
episodic numbness and motor weakness in her lower and upper
extremities. Pts symptoms have gotten progressively worse over
the last 10 days. [**Name (NI) 1094**] husband reports that patient has become
more somnolent and confused lately and sleeps often. Sleepiness
has been getting progressively worse. Denies any incontinence,
no vision changes, no abnormal headaches (gets headaches at
baseline). Went to OSH where she was imaged and found to have a
large epidural hematoma vs abscess. She was treated empirically
with vancomycin/ceftriaxone and flagyl. Pt was tranfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup. She was found to have an elevated INR
1.7, given vit K and 2 [**Location 16678**].

Pertinent Results:
[**9-16**] MRI L spine:
1. Large posterior epidural collection compressing the spinal
cord from C2 to
T1 and from T2 to T6. The collection persists at the T1 and T2
levels, but
causes less severe mass effect. This could represent either an
epidural
hematoma or an epidural infection. While evaluation is somewhat
limited
without contrast-enhanced images, either a hematoma or an
abscess could show
rim enhancement. There is no evidence of osteomyelitis, but
interspinous
edema is present at C7-T1.
2. Cervical spondylosis, better evaluated on the prior cervical
spine MRI.
3. Mild lumbar spondylosis.
4. Nodular liver, trace ascites, and splenomegaly, suggestive of
cirrhosis and
portal hypertension.

[**2183-9-25**] MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Since the previous study there is now more fluid identified
at the
laminectomy site and posteriorly in the cervical and upper
thoracic region
adjacent to the spinous processes with foci of low signal likely
due to air within it. This could be postoperative in nature but
clinical correlation recommended to exclude infection in this
fluid.
2. Enhancement and thin rim of fluid collection posterior to the
spinal cord from C4-C7 and T1 level unchanged from previous MRI.

3. No evidence of prevertebral abscess or abnormal signal within
the spinal
cord.

[**2183-9-19**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Bilateral asymmetrical airspace pattern in the mid and
lower lungs
is more severe on the left than the right, similar to the most
recent prior
radiograph. However, on an earlier radiograph of [**9-18**] at 3
a.m., the
right side was more affected than the left. Considering the
shifting
distribution and concurrent cardiac enlargement, widening of
vascular pedicle
and vascular engorgement, this probably reflects asymmetrical
pulmonary edema.
Recurrent aspiration is an additional diagnostic consideration
for the
lung findings. Moderate left pleural effusion and probable small
right
pleural effusion are not appreciably changed.

CXR [**9-27**]:
Cardiac size is top normal. Diffuse lung consolidations worse in
the left mid
lung are grossly unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities
or
pneumothorax. There are no large pleural effusions.

[**2183-9-17**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
systolic function with resting left ventricular outflow tract
gradient (may be related to resting tachycardia). No
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2183-9-30**] U/S abd:
IMPRESSION:
Moderate ascites.
Patent main portal vein with reversed flow.
Splenomegaly (17.7 cm).
Small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Surgical ICU course:

The patient was taken to the OR for washout and decompression of
the epidural abscess (which grew MSSA). She was initially
treated with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime, and zosyn
which was narrowed to nafcillin on [**9-25**]. Her SICU course was
complicated by MSSA pneumonia, a left femoral DVT for which she
was intially started on heparin gtt followed by coumadin on
[**9-27**], and confusion felt to be secondary to sedating
medications, potential alcohol withdrawal, and possibly hepatic
encephalopathy (lactulose was discontinued on [**9-20**]). She was
extubated on [**9-26**] and her mental status improved significantly.
She was transferred out of the unit and to the floor on [**9-28**].

Medicine Floor Hospital Course:

# MSSA Epidural Abscess - Pt found to have epidural abscess s/p
decompression and laminectomy, per ortho spine. She was given a
C-spine collar for stability. Pt treated empirically (vanco and
cefepine and cipro) for epidural abscess and then narrowed to
Nafcillin after sensitivities returned positive for MSSA. ID
followed pt in hospital. Pt will continue nafcillin for extended
therapy until she follows up with ortho-spine outpatient. Repeat
X-ray showed stable cervical alignment on [**9-30**]. CRP was trended
during hospitalization to assess resolution of epidural abscess.
CRP 219->100-->76. WBC count trended down during
hospitalization: 32->15->19->10.2. Pt continued to have
recurrent low grade temps (99.9) which was attributed to her
resolving epidural abscess. Blood cultures were negative as of
day of discharge. [**9-17**] TTE negative for endocarditis. RUQ U/S
negative for any biliary infection. Pt will keep C-collar on
until she follows up with ortho-spine within 4 weeks of
discharge. Pt will follow up with ID as well.
**REHAB:
-Continue Nafcillin regimen (day 1=[**2183-9-25**]). She will be on
this for several months, per ortho-spine reccomendations.
-She still has low grade temps of 99.9 which ID team attributed
to resolving epidural abscess.
-Pt needs a pediatric C-Collar. We were unable to provide on for
her at [**Hospital1 18**] since we only have access to adult collars. Please
provide a pedi-collar for her since the adult one is too big.
Thank you.
.
# MSSA Pneumonia - CXR revealed left lower lobe pneumonia
post-op. Sputum from [**9-20**] grew MSSA. Both the epidural abscess
and the pna had the same MSSA infection and were treated
empirically with vanco, cipro and cefepime, followed by
nafcillin after sensitivities returned. Pt's symptoms improved
and she was satting at 96-98% on RA at the time of discharge.
.
# Left femoral DVT/Coagulopathy - Pt has baseline coagulopathy
with elevated INR in setting of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction.
She was given daily DVT prophylaxis. Post op course complicated
by DVT in left femoral vein. Started on therapeutic heparin drip
followed by therapeutic lovanox [**Hospital1 **] injections. She began her
bridge to coumadin on [**2183-10-1**]. Pt will go to rehab on lovenox
60 [**Hospital1 **]/coumadin 2.5-5.0mg daily bridge. She will continue
coumadin therapy for at least 6 months, depending on ortho-spine
and primary care physician's recommendations. Pt had recent
normal endoscopy in [**3-/2183**] with no signs of esophageal varices.
Thus, team felt comfortable continuing anticoagulation for the
next several months. At discharge, INR=2.4 and PTT=43.
**REHAB:
-please continue to trend INR and PTT. She has been overlapped
on both lovenox and coumadin for 48 hrs at time of discharge.
Was getting coumadin 2.5mg daily on day of discharge
-INR goal: [**3-12**] for treatment of DVT.
.
# Diarrhea - Had diarrhea during hospitalization. C. Diff
negative x 3. Likely secondary to antibiotics. Lactulose was
discontinued in setting of diarrhea and was not restarted. When
diarrhea completely resolves, pt should re-start lactulose at
rehab to prevent hepatic encephalopathy. Diarrhea caused K+ and
bicarb wasting and she was repleted daily. Diarrhea improved
over the last few days of hospital course and she was given
yogurt probiotics to help with antibiotic induced diarrhea.
**REHAB:
-consider restarting home lactulose regimen (8 tablespoons/day)
when diahrea resolves.
-still has 4 bm/day, negative workup. Likely from antibiotics.
Recc giving pt probiotics at mealtime.
-Check Lytes, INR, PTT this coming monday and replete as needed.
-Please watch K+ and bicarb, she will likely need to be repleted
regularly (IV form of KCl was found to be more effective at
repleting her then PO since diarrhea). She has baseline low K+
and takes K+ at home regularly 20 mEq/day. Adding back the
spironolactone will also help. On day of discharge, her K=3.5,
we then gave her 40mEq IV KCL. We gave her sodium bicarb tabs
for her diahrea induced non-gap metabolic acidosis. We repleted
for bicarb <20.
.
# Confusion, AMS - Pt had AMS while in the SICU, described as
hallucinations. AMS was not attributed to DT's or alcohol
withdrawal since pt had last drink over 1 week before symptoms
started. She was placed on CIWA protocol anyway, given her
significant alcohol history. Mental status significantly
improved and pt was at baseline at time of discharge. Her home
oxazepam was held and may be restarted at rehab if patient
develops any anxiety or tremulousness. Home lactulose should be
restarted outpatient when pts diarrhea completely resolves to
prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
.
# Alcoholic [**Month/Day (3) **] - Alcohol dependence history. INR 1.5 on
admission, albumin low at 2.2. Was on lactulose chronically at
home but was stopped during hosptialization when pt had acute
diarrhea.  Abdominal US was performed and showed moderate
ascites. She was given thiamine, folate, Multivitamin daily.
CIWA protocol was initiated at begining of hospitalization.
**REHAB:
-[**Month (only) 116**] restart lactulose when diarrhea resolves
-[**Month (only) 116**] re-introduce home oxazepam if pt tremulous or anxious.
.
# Anemia - Has chronic anemia, on aranesp at home, likely
related to splenomegaly and alcoholism. Received 5 RBC
transfusions (last [**9-24**]) and multiple blood products while in
the SICU. HCT was stable at 25 at time of discharge. [**Month (only) 116**] resume
home aranesp when leave the hospital.
.
#Renal Insuficiency: Pt came in with Cr=1.5 After fluid
hdyration and surgery, Cr came down to 0.7-1.1 range. In setting
of diarrhea and fluid loss, Cr trended up slowly to 1.3. She was
given lactated ringers and gentle fluid hydration. Renal
insuficiency thought likely to be pre-renal with possibly
underlying chronic renal insuficiency from liver dysfunction.
.
# Hyperglycemia - patient without history of diabetes but was
given ISS for hyperglycemia in setting of tube feeds and
post-op.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Contined home regimen of levothyroxine 50 mcg
daily
.
# Depression - Contined home regimen of Zoloft 150mg daily &
Ritalin 20mg TID
.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Copaxone was held since admission since
there was concern that it might make pt more immunocompromised
in setting of acute infections. Pt should resume copaxone after
meeting with primary care physician and when acute infection is
resolved.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure providing care for you during your
hospitalization.

You were admitted for an infection in your back, near your
spinal cord, called an epidural abscess. You were treated with
surgery, drainage, as well as antibiotics. You have a collar on
your neck to maintain the alignment of your spine. You must keep
it on at all times. You will follow up with an orthopedic doctor
who will tell you when you may take it off. It is very important
to wear it all day and night.

During your hospitalization, you developed a clot in your leg
(for which you were given blood thinners). You must continue
these blood thinners at rehab. Right now you are taking 2 types
of blood thinners: lovenox and coumadin. Eventually you will
only take coumadin. You must continue to take coumadin for at
least 6 months and follow up regularly at special coumadin
clinics to check your blood and make sure it is thin. Your INR
goal is [**3-12**]. Do not stop taking coumadin until your primary care
doctor or the orthopedic doctor tells you to.

You also had episodes of confusion with altered mental status.
This occured after your surgery and improved during your
hospitalization.

You had diahrea which was thought to be due to your antibiotics.
You tested negative for a diahreal infection. Your diahrea
improved during your hospitalization.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-Vitamins were initially held and then restrated: Vit D [**2173**] U a
day, thimaine, folate.
-Lasix 20mg 4x/day was held
-Spironolactone 50mg TID was held
-Ritalin was initially held and then given
-Oxazepam was held. We gave you lorazepam instead. You can
restart your home oxazepam as needed when you leave the
hospital.
-Copaxone 20mg injection daily was held
-Aranesp 200mg was not given in the hospital. You nay resume
this at rehab.
-Lactulose was held in setting of diarrhea

You may resume your regular home medications when you leave the
hospital. Wait to see your primary care doctor before
re-starting the Furosemide and Copoxone. You may restart your
spironolactone, aranesp, and daily vitamins when you leave the
hospital.

We wish you a wonderful rehabilitation experience.

History of Present Illness:
54 year old woman with history of chronic multiple sclerosis,
osteomyelitis, MRSA wounds/ESBL urinary tract infections,
diverting colectomy w/ colostomy, sacral decub (stage 4),
depression, hyperlipidemia who presents with pancreatic
hemorrhaging. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 12748**] with altered mental status on [**5-9**]. She was
diagnosed with possible wound infection and started on IV
Vancomycin, in discussions with Infectious Disease. There was
also some concern for CDifficile infection and so the patient
was initially on PO vancomycin but all stool cultures this
admission were negative. The patient was also briefly on
meropenem for unclear reasons.
.
The patient had reported abdominal pain on admission and CT
abdomen revealed pancreatitis although lipase was 47. GI was
consulted and EGD documented a large duodenal ulcer without
bleeding. CT abdomen subsequently showed portal and splenic vein
thrombosis. Heme/Onc was consulted and diagnosed the patient
with Protein C and S deficiency; these may have been spurious
diagnoses in the setting of having already started the patient
on coumadin (confounder). Thus, Heme/Onc felt strongly about
anticoagulation (dalteparin) although GI at the OSH was
concerned regarding hemorrhaging into the pancreas given recent
pancreatitis. The patient continued to have abdominal pain and
had a hemoglobin/hematocrit drop with associated bright red
blood in ostomy. Hematocrit at its very lowest was 23.6. On
repeat CT abdomen yesterday, she was found to have an actively
hemorrhaging pancreatic lesion and non-acute pancreatitis. The
lesion was 10.5 X 2.2 cm. The surgical team was consulted but
had not seen her prior to transfer. The patient had been treated
since admission with iron for presumed iron deficiency anemia.
The patient was initially to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] medicine
floor but acutely dropped her BPs to SBP90s at the OSH. She was
transfused two units of blood (baseline Hct 26) with lasix in
between, prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
The patient was found to severely malnutritioned, with albumin
1.6.
.
Urology was also consulted for recurrent urinary tract
infections, neurogenic bladder and recommended bladder neck
closure and suprapubic catheter when more medically stable.
.
Vital signs prior to transfer: T99.3, BP98/68-120/63, HR 80
(sinus), RR13-17, 98% O2 sat on 2L nasal cannula.
.
On arrival in the MICU, VS were T 97.0, BP102/78, HR 82, RR 16,
98% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient was resting uncomfortably
in bed.
.
ROS: Patient resting comfortably in bed, states she feels very
tired. Endorses pain in right hip and lower back, otherwise no
complaints. Breathing feels okay.

[**5-25**] CXR:
Left PICC terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
This finding was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5144**] at 2:30 a.m. by
telephone by Dr. [**Name (NI) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**Name (NI) 3495**] size is normal. Patchy
bibasilar opacities are present, which could be due to
atelectasis, aspiration, or infectious pneumonia. Small right
pleural effusion is also noted.
.
[**5-28**] Abdominal ultrasound with dopplers:
1. No evidence for recurrent flow within the thrombosed splenic
artery
pseudoaneurysm.
2. Reversal of flow within the splenic vein, the significance of
this finding is uncertain. The splenic parenchyma was not
evaluated on this examination which was targeted to assessment
of the pseudoaneurysm.
.
[**5-28**] CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. Bilateral
small pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis. LUE PICC ends
in the lower SVC.
2. Thrombosis of the main and right portal vein, likely chronic
thrombosis of the left portal vein. Enhancement is not
appreciated within the narrowed splenic vein, likely thrombosed.
Patent hepatic veins. Minimal perisplenic fluid, but no evidence
of splenic infarcts.
3. S/P thrombin injection into the splenic artery
pseudoaneurysm, with a 6mm focus of arterial enhancement in the
region, suggesting minimal recanalization /residual flow.
4. Fat stranding surrounding the pancreatic tail/pseudoaneurysm,
with small phlegmon and fluid collection adjacent to the
pancreatic tail, s/o
pancreatitis. S/P diverting RLQ loop colostomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old woman with history of chronic multiple sclerosis,
osteomyelitis, diverting colectomy/colostomy, stage 4 sacral
decubitus ulcer, prior MRSA wound infections and ESBL E.Coli
urinary tract infections, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who
presents with peripancreatic hemorrhage from [**Hospital3 19345**] where she was admitted [**2109-5-9**] for altered mental
status, pancreatitis, possible wound infection and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2109-5-25**].

# Peripancreatic hemorrhage: Pseudoaneurysm suggested on this
patient's CT abdomen between a pseudocyst and the splenic vein.
It is possible, given the recent bright red blood in her
colostomy (although not currently) that there has been some
bleeding into the pancreatic duct as well (hemosuccus
pancreaticus). Consulted IR for mesenteric angiography with
embolization vs. coiling for pseudoaneurysm. On [**5-27**],
interventional radiology attempted stenting across the aneurysm
but was unable due to toruosity of the splenic vein. Instead,
using ultrasound guidance, thrombin was injected and the
patient's hematocrits remained stable. The patient underwent
repeat abdominal ultrasound with Dopplers which showed stable
pseudoaneurysm after IR intervention. The patient's hematocrit
remained stable and did not require any blood transfusions while
at [**Hospital1 18**].

# Portal Vein and Splenic Vein Thrombosis: Complications of
pancreatitis due to peri-pancreatic inflammation and can
actually cause gastric varices with portal hypertension. If
patient's protein C and S levels were drawn while on coumadin,
they were likely inaccurate. Pt will need weeks off therapy
before she can re-evaluated for coagulopathies.  Anticoagulation
was held as an inpatient as she remained asymptomatic and it was
discussed with Hepatology who recommended no anticoagulation in
the near future.  Pt will need outpt hematologic workup for
protein C and S deficiency in the future.

# Pancreatitis: Possibly due to gallstones seen on CT and
abdominal ultrasound. Patient's lipase was not elevated at the
OSH but had radiological findings and abdominal pain. The
patient's abdominal pain gradually resolved, initially as NPO
with IVF/TPN and then advanced a regular diet.  Pt will need
ongoing monitoring of nutrition intake given her low albumin.

# ESBL urinary tract infections: Evaluated by urology at OSH and
felt to have neurogenic bladder and would benefit from
suprapubic catheter. Urine culture repeated on admission showed
VRE although urinalysis was bland. The patient catheter was
changed and repeat UA showed possible infection. Of note, on
exam during foley catheter change, the patient's urethra
appeared enlarged/stretched. Urology was consulted and on
evaluation, felt that the patient's urethra had likely been
gradually dilated given multiple sclerosis and leaking around
catheter. Each time she leaked, the patient's catheters were
likely upsized, resulting in dilation. The patient will likely
benefit from suprapubic catheter placement in the future.
Patient grew enterococcus on repeat urine culture with a rising
leukocytosis. Linezolid was not used due to concern for
serotonin syndrome. Daptomycin allergy was actually ""warmth"" and
so patient carefully monitored and treated with Daptomycin which
she tolerated without difficulty. Patient was started on
daptomycin 350 mg iv q24 on [**2109-5-29**] and should continue until
[**2109-6-11**] for a 14 day total course.

# Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer and lateral gluteal ulcer:
Stable, previously with wound vac. Patient has a history of MRSA
wound infections. Wound care consulted and daily wound care
received while in house.  She was continued on Zinc and Vitamin
C to help with wound healing.

# Multiple sclerosis: Stable, patient lives at a rehab/nursing
facility at baseline.
The patient was resumed on her home baclofen and neurontin.

# PICC line infection: Blood culture from left sided PICC line
grew GPCs in clusters in [**2-8**] bottles. Decision was made to pull
picc line given likelihood of line infection. At the time of
discharge, the PICC tip Cx was negative for growth at 48hrs but
pt had been getting daily infusions of daptomycin through this
line.  A PICC line was resited in right antecubital fossa, and
chest AP portable film confirmed placement in the mid SVC, and
is ready to use upon discharge.

# Diverting colectomy, colostomy: Unclear original reason for
colostomy possibly to prevent infection of decub. Continue to
monitor ostomy which was guaiac positive in the MICU. Serial
hematocrits remained stable. Patient has known esophageal ulcer
on OSH EGD. She was continued on oral PPI daily.   She is
scheduled to follow up with GI for EGD biopsy results.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable, held gemfibrozil given pancreatitis.
.
# Malnutrition: Albumin significantly low at 1.6 at OSH and 2.3
here. Nutrition was consulted for for TPN. Continue
multivitamin, calcium, vitamin D. The patient is at risk for
infection on TPN, given past history. Nevertheless, she was
started on TPN with simultaneous encouragement for PO intake.
TPN was stopped on [**2109-6-6**]. She is not a candidate for G tube
placement at this time due to esophageal ulcer but should be
re-evaluated in [**4-10**] weeks.
.
# Depression: stable, continue Wellbutrin SR, zyprexa and
lamictal.
.
# Osteoarthritis: s/p bilateral total knee replacements, pt
requested vicodin for pain management, which was increased to
q4h prn. Her morphine liquid solution was stopped.
.
#CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI
Daptomycin Allergy:
The report of daptomycin allergy was not confirmed. Patient was
monitored carefully while getting daptomycin and did not have
any reactions.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:
FOLLOW-UP:
-Please make sure patient sees a gastroenterologist within 2
weeks after discharge for management of pancreatitis/pancreatic
hemorrhage. We have arranged for follow-up for a
gastroenenterologist at [**Hospital1 18**] but feel free to cancel this
appointment and make arrangements with a different
gastroenterologist.
- Patient will need MRCP to look for signs of liver malignancy
or infiltrative disease.
- She should be reevaluated for G-tube placement in [**4-10**] weeks.
- She should have repeat Contrast CT of the abdomen to evaluate
for residual pancreatic pseudoaneurysm

IMAGING:
CT Pelvis [**10-7**]: 1. Complex fracture of the right femoral neck
and intertrochanteric region. 2. Complex fracture of the left
femoral neck.
3. Bilateral complex supracondylar fractures. 4. Bilateral
hemarthrosis of the knees. 5. Subcutaneous soft tissue hematoma
tracking along bilateral thigh. 6. Severe osteopenia. 7.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine, SI and hip
joints. 8. Suprapubic Foley catheter in the urinary bladder and
air in the urinary bladder, presumably from catheter placement;
correlate clinically. 9. Nonspecific fat stranding about the
rectum; correlate clinically.

CT Max/Sinus [**10-8**]: 1. Multiple maxillofacial fractures including
the posterior sphenoid sinus, anterior and posterior frontal
sinus, ethmoidal air cells, nasal bone, medial wall of the right
maxillary sinus and anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus
and nasal bones . The bones are diffusely demineralized which
makes identification of any additional fractures difficult to
exclude. 2. Paranasal sinuses are filled with hyperdense
material, likely blood. 3. Small foci of pneumocephalus
posterior to the right frontal sinus. An underlying dural tear
and CSF leak cannot be excluded. 4. Diffuse intracranial
hemorrhage better characterized on concurrent head CT.

CT Head [**10-8**]: 1. Slightly increased small extra-axial hematoma
overlying the left frontal lobe convexity and possible small
secondary frontal hematoma noted on the right.  2. Stable
bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage layering around the bifrontal
and temporal lobes and extending into the suprasellar,
prepontine and interpeduncular cisterns with indentation on the
pons.  3. Likely anterior maxillary and nasal bone fractures
better evaluated on subsequent maxillofacial CT. Opacification
of the paranasal sinuses likely related to blood.  4. Subgaleal
hematoma overlying the right frontal bone.

CT Head [**10-8**]: No significant change compared to study performed
approximately 12 hours prior. Multifocal subarachnoid, subdural,
or intraventricular hemorrhage is redemonstrated, as is a
contusion involving the left inferior frontal lobe. Extensive
facial fractures with blood in the paranasal sinuses was better
characterized on prior dedicated facial bones CT. There is again
no midline shift or evidence of central brain herniation.

MRI C-spine [**10-9**]: 1. No obvious focus of marrow edema in the
cervical vertebrae. Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative
changes, with adequate assessment is significantly limited on
the axial images, due to motion-related artifacts. Vague areas
of cord signal intensity are noted, inadequately assessed on the
present study. Areas of altered signal intensity in the thecal
sac may relate to blood products/pulsation artifacts or a
combination of both given the presence of subarachnoid and
intraventricular hemorrhage on prior CT head study.

CT T/L Spine [**10-9**]: 1. Acute compression fracture of the T3
vertebral body, with buckling of the posterior cortex, the
inferior aspect of which is displaced posteriorly by
approximately 3 mm. Suspected T2 vertebral body fracture (seen
on concurrent cervical spine MRI) is not apparent by CT.
2. Compression deformities involving the T11, T12, and L1
vertebral bodies.  While as detailed above these may be chronic,
given the concurrent acute injury in the upper thoracic spine,
it is difficult to exclude an acute component.

MR T/L Spine [**10-10**]: 1. Areas of marrow edema in the T2 and T3
vertebral bodies, with mild contour irregularity of the
posterior cortex of T3 which is seen to indent the ventral
thecal sac and the ventral surface of the cord. Osseous details
are better assessed on the prior CT. Mild diffuse disc bulge,
with small-to-moderate sized disc extrusion, on the right side
deforming the right side of the cord at T7/8.  Small central
protrusion at T6-T7 level indenting the ventral thecal sac and
ventral cord.
Moderate loss of height T12 vertebral body with Schmorl's nodes,
likely
chronic. Mild-to-moderate loss of height of the L1 vertebral
body, with a Schmorl's node with an acute component of marrow
edema in the L1 vertebral body. Multilevel disc and facet
degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with mild foraminal
narrowing at L4 and L5 levels. 2. Diffusely altered signal
intensity in the thecal sac, may relate to pulsation artifacts;
however, blood products cannot be completely excluded given the
presence of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage on the
prior CT head study. 3. Vague areas of increased signal
intensity in the thoracic cord, nature of which is uncertain.
Assessment of cord lesions is limited due to artifacts.
Attention on followup can be considered.  4. Diffuse hypointense
signal of the marrow- correlate with hematology labs. 5.
Bilateral pleural effusions and distended gall bladder
-correlate with
dedicated imaging.

CT Head [**10-10**]: 1. Minimal increase of the intraventricular
hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns. Otherwise, no change
of the intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
2. No shift of midline structures and no intracranial
herniation. 3. Stable minimal dilatation of the ventricles.

PATHOLOGY:
[**2122-10-8**]: Bone, left femoral head, hemiarthroplasty:
- Bone and cartilage with changes consistent with fracture site.
- Bone marrow with an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, consistent
with known history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from OSH via [**Location (un) **] intubated and
sedated.  STAT trauma protocol was initiated on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.  Evaluation was carried out by ACS trauma team and ED
trauma.  Imaging was obtained as per above.  Patient was
tachycardic/hypotensive despite crystalloid fluid resuscitation.
 4 units pRBC were given in trauma bay.  Patient was then
stabilized and admitted to the TSICU for further management.

Neuro: At baseline patient is wheelchair bound secondary to MS.
Cognitive baseline is described as mentally sharp with ability
to do crossword puzzles.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient was not
seen to be spontaneously moving extremities and not following
commands.  This mental status persisted throughout admission.

CT head obtained on admission demonstrated traumatic brain
injury (left frontal subdural hematoma and scattered
frontotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage).  This was found to be
grossly stable on interval imaging during admission.  Seizure
prophylaxis was administered per neurosurgical recommendation.
Patient will follow up with neurosurgery with interval imaging
per instructions.

Throughout hospital course patient was given pain medication
with good effect and adequate relief.  Tylenol and narcotics
initially administered via IV and then transition to enteral
with good effect.

CV: Patient demonstrated sinus tachycardia on admission to
TSICU.  This was minimally responsive to fluid resuscitation.
Beta blockade was initiated following confirmation of adequate
pain control and stable hematocrit.  This was titrated up with
good effect.

At time of discharge patient is on stable dose of metoprolol
with no cardiac issues.  Vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: Patient was admitted intubated.  Respiratory support
was continued.  [**10-11**] patient was febrile with desaturations.
Bronchoscopy was performed that demonstrated thick secretions
and treatment was initiated for VAP.

Given inability to wean from ventilatory support a tracheostomy
was placed [**10-14**].  Procedure was tolerated well and remains in
good position at time of discharge.  At time of discharge
patient tolerating T-piece supplemental oxygen with persistent
requirement for Q2-3 hour suctioning/pulmonary toilet.

GI/GU: Patient was NPO with IVF at time of admission.  Enteral
feeding was initiated [**10-9**] with appropriate recommendations made
by nutrition service.  These were well tolerated and bowel
regimen was given with good effect.  Enteral access via PEG tube
was obtained [**10-14**] given expectation for long term inability to
tolerate po intake.  This was noted to be in good position and
functioning well.  At time of discharge patient on stable
enteral feeding regimen and passing flatus/BMs appropriately.

Patient was admitted with suprapubic catheter in place related
to MS.  This was continued throughout admission.  Following
initial resuscitation lasix was utilized to assist in diuresis
of massive volume previously required for cardiovascular
support.  At time of discharge patient with adequate urine
output via pre-existing suprapubic catheter.  Intake and output
were closely monitored.

MSK: Patient sustained bilateral proximal and distal fractures
of the femur that were repaired by orthopedics as per above
[**10-8**].  Patient is discharge with recommendation to be non-weight
bearing at bilateral hips but may have full range of
active/passive motion at knees.  Multipodus boots used
throughout admission per PT recommendations.  Patient was seen
early by physical therapy who continued to work with patient
throughout admission.

Patient was noted to have thoracic spine fractures as above.  A
[**Location (un) **] brace was recommended by ortho spine.  This was obtained
during admission.  She should wear this at all times when not in
bed.  In bed patient may be without brace on logroll
precautions.

Facial fractures were evaluated by plastic surgery.  Nasal bone
fracture was reduced at the bedside [**10-8**].  Other fractures
non-operative per plastic surgery with no need for plastics
follow up.

HEME: Patient has a history of [**Month/Year (2) **] which was demonstrated via
WBC in 40s on admission.  Patient was transfused 4 pRBC prior to
arrival in TSICU related to refractory hypotension at OSH.  [**10-8**]
patient was further transfused 3 pRBC, 1 FFP and 1 platelets
while in operating room with orthopedics.  [**10-9**] hematocrit was
persistently low without appropriate increases seen on prior
day's transfusions.  Three additional units of pRBC were
transfused and patient's hematocrit remained stable in the low
to mid 20s for remainder of admission.  Hematology/oncology were
consulted during this admission for considerations of [**Month/Year (2) **] in
trauma patient.  They recommended further workup of hematologic
malignancy if patient manifested symptoms of hematologic
dysfunction which she did not.

An IVC filter was placed [**10-14**] given likelihood of protracted
immobility and multiple orthopedic injuries.  LENIs had been
obtained prior to this ([**10-13**]) and these were negative.

A HIT panel was sent for concern of low platelets during this
admission and this was found to be negative.  Heparin products
were briefly held related to this but resumed when negative test
was found.

ID: Patient had recently completed a course of antibiotics for
UTI at time of admission.

Patient was febrile on [**10-11**] and pan cultures were obtained.
Given desaturations and CXR findings at this time VAP protocol
was initiated with triple antibiotic therapy (vancomycin,
cefepime and cipro).  BAL specimens demonstrated MRSA on [**10-11**]
and [**10-16**].  Antibiotics were tailored appropriately.  Cipro was
discontinued [**10-14**] and fluconazole started for finding of yeast
in BAL and UCx.  Cefepime was discontinued [**10-15**].  At time of
discharge patient is completing 14 day course of vancomycin and
fluconazole and had been afebrile for over 72 hours.  Vancomycin
and fluconazole have been discontinued.

Prophylaxis: See heme.

Disposition: Patient was actively screened for appropriate
post-hospital care and was accepted to facility.  Regarding code
status health care proxy has stated that patient is full code.
Discussions prior to injury HCP states that patient never wanted
to discuss things of this nature.

At the time of discharge on [**2122-10-23**], the patient was doing
well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating enteral
feeding, bedbound, voiding via suprapubic catheter, and pain was
well controlled.

Of note: borderline potassium of 5.6 reported on [**10-23**]. 15 gm
Kayexalate given.  Please repeat potassium [**10-23**] and [**10-24**]

Patient was not started on home lasix dose while hospitalized
because of borderline creatinine.   Please resume 40 mg lasix
daily ( records unclear as to home dose....40 mg daily or 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **]) Continue to monitor lytes/creat.)

baseline blood pressure and mental status.  Soon afterwards, she
complained to another staff member that she was hot and wanted a
drink; when nurse returned with a drink, she was more lethargic
with elevated BP 180/90. In the ambulance, patient was noted to
not be withdrawing to pain on the left side.

Of note, per nursing home staff, patient's foley [**Last Name (un) **] has been
changed about 3 times since [**2118-3-24**] because it has either fallen
our or was noted to have increased urine sediment.

In the ED, initial vs were: 101.9 92 152/72 16 100% 4L NC. Both
eyes were deviated downwards, and patient was not following any
commands.  She was agitated and had another episode of emesis in
the ED in setting of altered mental status.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note, she
was noted to be 83% on ?room air, presenting with some
difficulty breathing. Patient was intubated for airway
protection with etomidate and succynlcholine, pretreated with
lidocaine 100mg x1 IV.  ETT was initially placed in Right
Mainstem Bronchus, pulled back about 4-5cm with bilateral breath
sounds noted on exam.  She dropped BPs initially on propofol, so
she was switched to midazolam and fentanyl for sedation.
Patient was previously DNR/DNI, but husband revoked this and
made her Full Code in the ED.  Code Stroke was called in the ED
at 12:45pm.  CTA and CT-perfusion unremarkable.  On Neurology
team exam post intubation, patient was moving all extremities.
She was noted to have significant UTI and was given a dose of IV
ciprofloxacin 500mg x1. Given fever and hx of UTIs, Neurology
team suspects that symptoms were secondary to UTI rather than a
central neurologic process.  Vitals in ED prior to ICU transfer
were as follows: 65  127/62  100% on AC FiO2 100%  RR 15  PEEP
5.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated,
appearing comfortable, unable to provide further history.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):

[**2118-3-30**]: ct abdomen/pelvis with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal source for the patient's
bacteremia.
2. Essentially normal abdomen and pelvic CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
64F with hx of Multiple Sclerosis, chronic indwelling foley,
presenting with altered mental status, including slurred speech
and temporary left-sided weakness, found to have UTI, hypoxia,
intubated after emesis x2 in setting of altered mental status.

Altered Mental Status, urinary tract infection based on + u/a
but culture with mixed colonization, e coli bacteremia:

Patient was noted to have altered mental status in addition to
new Left-sided arm weakness and worsening of baseline slurred
speech on presentation to EMS and in ED.  On Neurology
examination post-intubation, patient was moving both upper
extremities spontaneously, and CT Head and Neck Perfusion showed
no acute process.  Neurology team felt that symptoms likely
represented delirium in setting of UTI and not likely central
process.  No known stroke history. Patient does have hx of
multiple sclerosis, so UTI likely exacerbated multiple sclerosis
symptoms. Patient had negative cardiac enzymes and UTI was
treated. She was extubated on [**3-29**] without complication.  Her
mental status after extubation was at baseline.  Neurologic
symptoms improved with treatment of infection.

E coli bacteremia: Blood cultures grew E coli so Meropenem was
added to Cipro morning of [**3-29**].  Ciprofloxacin had been started
in the ED. Surveillance blood cultures were sent.  Surveillance
cultures negative, E coli grew from +BCx and was ESBL.  She will
require an additional 11 DAYS OF MEROPENEM FOR A TOTAL 14 DAY
COURSE, LAST DAY OF ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE [**2118-4-11**].  CT of the
abdomen / pelvis done to search for other cause of bacteremia
given that the u/a had mixed flora, this was negative for any
acute intraabdominal findings.  In addition LFTs were normal
making a biliary source unlikely.  Foley was replaced in ED as
the most likely source.  Lactate elevated to 4.1 in ED which
decreased to 0.6.

Hypoxia
Patient intubated in ED to protect airway due to emesis in
setting of altered mental status.  She was reportedly not having
any respiratory symptoms in the ED, though nursing report shows
O2sat of 83% prior to intubation. Patient was extubated on [**3-29**]
without complication.

Code:  Full Code (confirmed with family in ED and on arrival to
MICU)
Patient was DNR/DNI previously, but husband revoked it in the

IMAGING:
Head CT [**2-6**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large 3.5 x 4.8 cm intra-axial
right frontal lobar hemorrhage, with surrounding edema and
associated mass effect. The midline shift measures approximately
7 mm. Underlying masses possibly present, although this may
represent bland hemorrhage. MRI is recommended for further
evaluation. There are no other foci of intracranial hemorrhage
identified. Aside from mass effect from the hematoma, the
ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are unremarkable in appearance.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved as
well. There is no evidence for acute large vascular territory
infarction. Visualized bones demonstrate no abnormality.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Large right frontal lobar hemorrhage. MRI is
recommended for
further evaluation to exclude underlying mass lesion.

MRI Head [**2-7**]:
FINDINGS: Again identified is a large right frontal hematoma.
The overall
size of the hematoma appears unchanged since the prior CT scans.
Again
identified is extensive surrounding edema with local mass effect
and mild
right to left midline shift. There are numerous other areas of
deep white
matter hyperintensity in a predominantly periventricular
pattern. Although
this could be a consequence of chronic small vessel ischemia,
the possibility of demyelinating disease should be considered.
After contrast administration, there is a thin rim of
enhancement surrounding the hematoma. In addition, at least one
small vessel is detected coursing
through the center of the hematoma. These findings raise the
possibility of an underlying vascular malformation as the
etiology of the hemorrhage.
Enhancement of the periphery of the hematoma may arise after
several days is a consequence of hemorrhage alone. Thus, the
significance of the enhancement and edema depend on the time
elapsed between the hemorrhage and these images. Early
appearance of enhancement and edema implies an underlying lesion
that could produce both, such as a neoplasm. After several days,
the combination of enhancement and edema may represent reaction
to the hematoma itself, and are thus of little diagnostic
significance. There are no prominent feeding vessels or draining
veins, thus a CT angiogram is unlikely to be helpful. If it is
necessary to pursue the possibility of a vascular malformation,
a catheter arteriogram may be needed.
CONCLUSION: Right frontal hematoma again seen with surrounding
edema and a
thin rim of enhancement. There may be a small vessel coursing
through the
substance of the hematoma.

CT Torso:
POST-CONTRAST CT OF THE CHEST: Imaged thyroid gland appears
unremarkable.
Multiple subcentimeter mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are
identified. The aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
calcifications with no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
Pulmonary arteries are grossly unremarkable. The heart is not
enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a somewhat
hypoenhancing lobulated mass in the left posterior mid-lower
hemithorax adjacent to the vertebral body and inseparable from
the medial pleural space and the left hilum measuring
approximately 5.9 x 4.8 cm (3:25). There are adjacent
atelectatic changes as well as interlobular and intralobular
septal thickening. Severe emphysema is noted. There is a 2.4 x
3.2 cm spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (3:22). Linear
opacity in the left upper lobe may represent scarring (3:13).
There is no pneumothorax. Atelectatic changes of the left lower
lobe are noted.
ABDOMINAL CT WITH CONTRAST: The liver contains a 0.9-cm area of
hypoenhancement (3:52). There are also subcentimeter
hypodensities in the
left lobe (3:54-57), incompletely characterized. Gallbladder is
unremarkable. Spleen, pancreas appear unremarkable. Both
adrenals contain large adenomas measuring up to 2.7 cm on the
left and 2.5 cm on the right. Both kidneys are in normal
anatomic location and demonstrate symmetric enhancement. Imaged
bowel is unremarkable. There is no bowel obstruction or bowel
wall thickening. Abdominal aorta and iliac vessels demonstrate
atherosclerotic calcifications with no aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy by size criteria.
PELVIC CT WITH CONTRAST: Small amount of air within the urinary
bladder is
likely secondary to instrumentation. A Foley catheter is seen in
the urinary bladder. There is moderate amount of urine in the
urinary bladder. Rectosigmoid colon is grossly unremarkable and
contains stool. The uterus
contains multiple fibroids, some of which are calcified and
likely
degenerating. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a probable bone island measuring 4
mm in the
left femoral head (3:113). No lesion to suggest malignancy or
infection is
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Spiculated right upper lobe mass concerning for malignancy.
Hypoenhancing mass in the left mid-lower hemithorax (possibly
necrotic) is pleural-based with adjacent post-obstructive
pneumonia or lymphangitic spread of cancer. Subcentimeter
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Bilateral adrenal adenomas. Fibroid uterus.
3. Severe emphysema.

MRI Head [**2-11**]:
Post-surgical changes are noted in the right frontal lobe and in
the adjacent bone and external soft tissues, with blood
products, and moderate vasogenic edema. On the post-contrast
images, there is some enhancement noted in the adjacent dura as
well as in the surgical bed resection cavity. There is shift of
the midline structures to the left side, of about 6 mm. The
ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are unremarkable except
for effacement/mass effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] by the
edema in the right frontal lobe. Multiple FLAIR hyperintense
areas, noted elsewhere in the cerebral white matter are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes in the right frontal lobe and in the
right frontal region, with some enhancement in the dura and in
surgical bed. The changes could reflect post-surgical changes
with or without residual tumor. Consider followup evaluation,
for better assessment and distinction. Mild-to-moderate
surrounding vasogenic edema and leftward shift of the midline
structures with mass effect on the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as
described above. These are unchanged compared to the most recent
CT study.

RIGHT FRONTAL MASS PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING
RIGHT FOOT BIOSPY PATHOLOGY: REPORT PENDING


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after OSH imaging revealed a
signifcantly sized right frontal hemorrhagic mass. CT was
concerning for underlying lesion; so MRI was performed to
confirm this. Neuro and neuroradiation oncology were consulted.
CT torso was also done, which was significant for pulmonary and
adnrenal lesions. Pulmonary biopsy was pursued, however this was
refused by the patient's legal proxy due to ""previous familial
bad experiences"".
On [**2-10**], she was taken to the OR for right crani for tumor
debulking and diagnosis. Preliminary pathology was consistant
with metastatic melanoma. Dermatology was consulted post-op.
She was maintained overnight in the ICU for frequent
neurochecks, and SBP control. She had no events overnight.

On the morning of POD #1, she had very mild LUE/LLE weakness
(constistent with pre-op), but otherwise doing well and
neurology intact.  She was transferred out of the ICU to the
floor. She was seen again by Dermatology, who did a biopsy of a
suspicious looking lesion on the bottom of her right foot, that
was once previously diagnosed as a dysplastic nevi. (It was
subsequently removed).Pathology of this lesion was not available
at the time of discharge
POD #2 [**2151-2-12**], Pt seen by PT/OT, who determined she would be
appropriate for disposition to home with services and 24h
observation by her family. She was given instruction for follow
up with Med-onc, dermatology, neuro-onc and radiation oncology.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE:
??????	You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and
report any of the following problems to your physician.
??????	Keep your incision clean and dry.
??????	You may wash your hair with a mild shampoo 24 hours after your
sutures are removed.
??????	Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your
incision.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up
appointment.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating
before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated,
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may
cause constipation.

MEDICATIONS:
??????	Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough
to walk.
??????	Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.
??????	Medications that may be prescribed include:
-Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
	-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and
anesthesia can cause constipation.
??????	You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.
??????	You are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you
are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec,
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with
meals, or a glass of milk.

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself
again. In general:
??????	Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor
and therapist.
??????	Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you
are feeling good.
??????	You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
??????	If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.
??????	Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy
objects, or straining at stool.
??????	Do your breathing exercises every two hours.
??????	Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you
are awake.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old female w/MS (bedbound), DM, COPD [**Hospital 4045**]
transferred from rehab facility w/acute onset AMS.  Reportedly
hypoxic to high 80s.  The history is obtained from her son who
is at bedside.
.
Of note, she has frequent UTIs and was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 116**] for
urosepsis (E.coli sensitive to Zosyn, Meropenem, Gent).
.
In the ED, she very rapidly deteriorated, began vomiting and her
BPs rose to 200s systolic initially in the ED.  She underwent a
CT head - no bleed.  She became not responsive to voice or
sternal rub, then became apneic.  There was ?seizure, no known
seizure disorder --> given 2mg ativan.  Due to ongoing hypoxia,
she was given ketamine to take a look at the cords -->
laryngospasm --> intubation.   Intubated with ketamine,
lidocaine and fentanyl for airway protection; fent and midaz for
sedation.  During the intubation, she actively vomited and
aspirated gastric contents.  She was given gentamicin and
admitted to the MICU.

Son reports that this all happened over a matter of 1 hour this
afternoon.  She has needed to be intubated in the past for
urosepsis.  Additionally, she had minimal UOP and was given 3L
NS.  However, she was never hypotensive, 102/78 at lowest
(usually 110s-120s).  Febrile to 103 rectally.  ABG: pH 7.25

IMAGING:
[**10-19**] CT HEAD: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarction, edema, or shift of normally
midline structures is present.  Extensive confluent
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. The ventricles
and sulci are enlarged consistent with cortical atrophy, likely
secondary to patient's known multiple sclerosis. Basal cisterns
are patent. Air-fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid
sinuses are consistent with sinusitis. Mastoid air cells are
well pneumatized.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process
.
[**10-20**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: There is a consolidation in
the right lower lobe, consistent with patient's history of
aspiration pneumonia. There are bilateral trace effusions. There
is a possible tiny right pneumothorax, which is incompletely
imaged. There are no pulmonary nodules or masses. The base of
the heart is normal in size. There is calcifications of the
coronary arteries. There is no pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN: The liver is normal shape and contour. There are no
discrete
hepatic masses. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
dilation.  The portal veins are patent. There is no gallbladder.
The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal
glands are normal.
In the right kidney, there is a large renal staghorn calculus
without
hydronephrosis or hydroureter. In the left kidney, there is a 16
mm calculus within the left proximal ureter. There is associated
mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis, likely secondary to ureteral
obstruction. Three smaller non-obstructing left renal calculi
are present. They measure 10 mm, 6 mm and 5 mm. The kidneys
enhance heterogeneously. On the right, it appears to be more due
to artifact. On the left, the heterogeneous enhancement appears
somewhat more geographical, is concerning for pyelonephritis.
There is no excretion of the contrast into either ureter on the
right or the left. The right ureter, although nor opacified, is
normal in course and caliber. The left ureter has peripheral rim
enhancement, suggesting underlying infection.  There is a Foley
in place in a collapsed bladder. There are no stones seen within
the bladder.
The stomach is unremarkable. The duodenum and jejunum are normal
in course
and caliber. There is no mesenteric stranding. There is a large
amount of
fecal material within the rectum. The sigmoid and descending
colon are
relatively collapsed. There is some fat stranding in the left
retroperitoneum, which is likely due to the kidney and ureter,
rather than the colon. There are multiple diverticula, but no
definite evidence of
diverticulitis. There is no abdominal, mesenteric, pelvic or
inguinal
lymphadenopathy. The abdominal vasculature is normal in course
and caliber, other than a calcified splenic artery aneurysm,
which is stable since [**11**]/[**2117**].
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. The right hip appears malrotated with the acetabular
notch approximating the anterior acetabulum. There are no
fractures.
IMPRESSION:
1. 16-mm calculus within the left proximal ureter with moderate
hydronephrosis. Heterogenous enhancement of the kidney and rim
enhancement of the ureter suggest infection.
2. Three nonobstructing left renal calculi.
3. Right renal staghorn calculus without hydronephrosis or
hydroureter.
4. Right lower lobe consolidation.
5. Possible tiny right pneumothorax, which is incompletely
imaged.
6. Calcified splenic artery aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old female with history of recurrent
urinary tract infections, including extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase producing organisms, multiple sclerosis with
spastic bladder, and nephrolithiasis admitted for urinary tract
infection, E. coli septicemia, and sepsis.

#Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia/urinary tract
infection/nephrolithiasis/hydronephrosis:
Patient was admitted with sepsis and was admitted to the
intensive care unit. She required vasopressor support and was
noted to have an obstructing left renal stone. Urology was
consulted and Infectious Disease was consulted and a
percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed to facilitate urinary
drainage. The patient improved with antibiotics and was
transferred to the floor to complete a 14 day course of IV
Meropenem with Ertapenem to be used to complete course following
discharge. Although it was noted that without removal or the
left renal stone the patient would be at risk for recurrent
infections, the patient was felt to be at too high risk for
surgical nephrolithotomy or extra-corporeal shock wave
lithotripsy. Therefore, the patient was discharged with
percutaneous nephrostomy tube to be changed every 3 months and
the patient will follow up in [**Hospital 159**] clinic.

#Respiratory failure/Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/Multiple sclerosis:
Patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting
of her infection and required intubation. She was treated with
bronchodilators and steroids and had improvement in her
symptoms. She was extubated but had a persistent oxygen
requirement felt to be due to a combination of respiratory
muscle weakness in the setting of multiple sclerosis and
infection. There was also intermittent aspiration that improved
when diet was changed to a dysphagia diet. Patient completed her
steroid course in the hospital and was discharged to rehab on 4L
supplemental oxygen which had been a stable requirement for >48
hours prior to discharge.

#Dysphagia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was seen by speech and swallow following a
witnessed aspiration on [**2118-10-26**]. She was approved for nectar
thick liquids and pureed solids.

#Encephalopathy: This was felt to be due to sepsis. Head CT was
negative for bleeding and mental status improved slowly over
hospital course.

#Acute kidney injury ([**Last Name (un) **])/Acute Renal Failure: Baseline
creatinine was 0.6 and upon admission was elevated. She was
treated with IV fluids and antibiotics as above.  By the time of
discharge, her Cr had improved to baseline.

#Hypertension: When she was NPO her home amlodpine and diltiazem
were held.  This resulted in her systolic blood pressures
increasing to 170s-180s with tachycardia.  She had worsening
respiratory distress with elevated blood pressures.  Thus, she
was controlled with an esmolol drip in the ICU with improvement
in her oxygen saturations.  When she was able to take oral
medications again, her home diltiazem and amlodipine were
restarted also with good control of blood pressure and heart
rate.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
#Hyperlipidemia (HLD): Continued statin
.
#Multiple sclerosis (MS): Continued her home copaxone and after
extubation she was restarted on her muscle relaxants
.
# Depression: Citalopram was initially held then restarted
.
# Hypertension: Amlodipine was held and then restarted.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Nephrostomy tube: per urology consult this will remain in
place until outpatient followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] Urologist. [**Month (only) 116**]
need nephrostomy tube indefinitely.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old female with esophageal varices
who presented with hematemesis of unclear etiology.

# Hematemesis: On admission, her Hct was 21.2.  A nasogastic
lavage showed no evidence of active bleeding. In the ED she was
started on pantoprazole and octreotide drips and was ordered for
2units of PRBCs. She was continued on the drips in the ICU. She
was given ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. An EGD was
performed which revealed varices but no ulcers or bleeding
varices were noted, so the Octreotide was discontinued. She was
continued on a PPI and started on clears diet and advanced
appropriately.  Pt admitted later that she had experienced a
nosebleed prior to the onset of the coffee ground emesis.  A
source of GI bleeding was never identified.  This nosebleed may
have played a role, but considering how low her Hct was it would
have had to have been a significant bleed, so a GI bleeding
source is still more likely. Her Hct was 26.8 upon discharge.
She was discharged with prescriptions for 7 day total course of
cipro for SBP prophylaxis and her protonix dose was increased.
She will follow up with her liver doctor in one week.

# Abdominal Pain: A RUQ Ultrasound was performed which showed
cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension, including
reversal of flow in the main portal vein, and no ascites.  No
clear cause of her pain was identified, however, she was treated
prophylactically for SBP.

# Thrombocytopenia: Unclear baseline. Given cirrhosis, likely
this was due to poor synthetic function from underlying chronic
liver disease.

# Coagulopathy: INR 1.7 with unclear baseline. She was given
Vitamin K and INR improved to 1.5 on discharge.

# Alcoholism: Given patient's current use of alcohol she
received thiamine and was started on a CIWA scale with
lorazepam. Social work and addiction specialists were consulted.
 She did not show signs of withdrawal during this admission.  It
is possible that alcohol use triggered the patient's current
episode of abdominal pain and vomiting, which led to GI
bleeding.  She was urged not to drink alcohol in the future.

# Cough: Of unclear etiology. There was no evidence of active
infection, such as leukocytosis, fever, or O2 requirement, and
CXR was unremarkable.  She was given guaifenesin for symptomatic
relief, and no further actions were taken for this.

# Seizure Disorder: She was continued on Keppra

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 73130**],

You came to [**Hospital1 18**] from another hospital because you had
abdominal pain and were vomiting blood.  Your blood count was
low, so the other hospital gave you one unit of blood and
transferred you to [**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the ICU and
received another 2 units of blood and were given antibiotics to
prevent infection.  You got an upper endoscopy in the ICU, but
it did not show any active bleeding, so you were transferred out
of the ICU.  Your blood counts improved and you felt better, so
you were sent home.  You should avoid drinking alcohol in the
future.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-START Ciprofloxacin 500mg by mouth twice a day for 3 days
-INCREASE Protonix to 40mg by mouth twice a day

Followup Instructions:
Please see your liver doctor in one week.

CATHETER TIP: no growth (final)
C DIFF: negative
BLOOD CULTURES ([**10-14**]): negative x 2

OF NOTE:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Fracture after trauma. Now upper extremity
weakness.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images and
axial gradient echo and T2-weighted images were obtained.
FINDINGS:
The study is degraded by patient motion. The C2 fracture shown
on the CT of the same day is again visualized, primarily on the
STIR images. At the level of the base of C2, where the posterior
inferior corner of C2 is displaced slightly into the spinal
canal, there is T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord dorsally,
suggesting a contusion. Osteophytes are noted at C3-4 level.
There appears to be some edema in C4, where there is an anterior
fusion and metallic artifact from a cage. No fracture was seen
on the CT. There is also metallic artifact from the cage at
C5-6. The disc space osteophyte seen at C6-7 on the CT is
visible.
IMPRESSION:
1. The study is limited by motion, but there appears to be edema
in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord at the level of the
inferior aspect of C2, suggestive of a spinal cord contusion.
2. The known fracture through the C2 pedicles and the base of C2
is visualized. There is minimal displacement of the fragment
from the posterior inferior aspect of C2 into the canal, but the
CSF around the spinal cord remains patent.
3. The postsurgical and degenerative disc disease changes at
other levels are visualized to some extent.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL
INDICATION: Elevated bilirubin.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Limited views of the liver are
unremarkable. There is no evidence of ascites. The gallbladder
is decompressed and the wall is thickened. There is no evidence
of cholelithiasis or pericholecystic fluid. There is no intra or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation and the common bile duct
measures 3 mm. The flow within the portal vein is hepatopetal.
IMPRESSION: Decompressed gallbladder with wall thickening. No
evidence of acute cholecystitis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-10-18**] 11:49 AM
CHEST: Tracheostomy tube is present. The tip of the Dobhoff tube
lies within the second part of the duodenum. The tip of the
central line lies in the region of the junction of the right
atrium and SVC.
Hazy opacity seen in the right lower lobe probably representing
an area of atelectasis. An early infiltrate in this region could
not be excluded. Elsewhere, the lung fields appear clear.
IMPRESSION: Atelectasis or possible pneumonic consolidation,
right lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was hemodynamically stable on arrival. He was seen
on arrival in the ED by the Trauma Surgery service and the
Orthopedic Surgery service, and his initial evaluation confirmed
the hangman's type C2 fracture. Although his intiial neurologic
examination was essentially normal, a repeat exam revealed [**5-18**]
strength in the right upper extremity and decreased pinpick
sensation in all extremities. He underwent a STAT c-spine MRI
which showed possible spinal cord contusion but no evidence of
cord compression by fracture of epidural hematoma.

The patient was started on steroids and admitted to the Trauma
ICU. He was taken to the OR for a halo vest application. Prior
to the surgery he was delusional and combative, issues that
reoccurred multiple times during his hospital stay. In the OR he
was a difficult intubation because of his prior C4-6 surgery.
During his time in the ICU he there was concern that he was
having DTs (hypertension, tachycardia, agitation).

His WBC count increased while hospitalized and he was febrile in
the ICU. He was started on levofloxacin for what appeared to be
an evolving pneumonia; vancomycin was added when his clincal
status did not immediately improve, and then he was switched to
a combination of vancomycin, flagyl and zosyn.

Given his pulmonary status, DTs, and concern for difficulty with
reintubation because of the halo, he underwent a bedside
percutaneous tracheostomy on [**10-11**] with no complications. He
did continue to have periods of agitation and confusion.

During the rest of his stay in the ICU and on the floor he had
no major problems. [**Name (NI) **] had further imaging, including a HIDA
scan, and cultures sent to evaluate his high WBC count. He
remained afebrile during the last 5 days of his stay while still
on Zosyn and Vancomycin, and his blood cultures and urine
cultures were negative. His sputum culture grew coag-positive
Staph aureus; sensitivities were still pending at the time of
discharge. After a discussion with the ID fellow, he was
discharged on Zosyn and Vancomycin with plans to complete a full
14-day course.

He was seen daily by physical therapy and progressed well.

History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with MS, dyslipidemia, transferred from
[**Hospital3 7571**]today for management of new congestive heart
failure.  She presented on [**2188-11-2**] to OSH for worsening and
severe nonproductive cough x 4 days, limiting ability to speak
and accompanied by posttussive emesis.  No fevers, CP, or
dizziness.  Decreased exercise tolerance.
.
In the [**Location (un) **] ED: VS: T 97.6, BP 157/32, P 111, RR 22, O2sat
100% on 2L.  She was diagnosed with bronchitis and given
steroids and bronchodilators in the ED.  While awaiting
admission, she went to the bathroom v. bed pan where she
collapsed.  She apparently suffered a respiratory arrest during
which time she was cyanotic and unresponsive.  She was
emergently intubated and sedated with propofol.  VS recorded
after this event showed: BP 124/76, RR 20.  EKG showed sinus
rhythm with known LBBB.  She was admitted to ICU where she
became hypotensive so was started on dopamine which was
subsequently changed to levophed.  TTE showed LV dilatation with
an EF 10%, minimally dilated RV with hypokinesis, moderate MR,
PASP 30.  CTA chest showed 2 small left-sided subsegmental PEs
and small bilateral aspiration pneumonias and pleural effusions.
 Pt started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia and heparin gtt for PE.  Accodring to
report, she had coffee grounds in her NG on the day prior to
transfer and was started on IV pantoprazole; Hct stable ~40.
She had mild, serially rising trop: 0.08 -> 0.1 -> 0.63 -> 0.93
but has not been given aspirin due to gastritis. Prior to
transfer here, she was weaned off her levophed and propofol and
extubated; her RIJ and femoral triple lumen venous catheter were
also removed. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] further cardiology
evaluation of new CHF as well as UA versus NSTEMI with possible
plan for cardiac cath.    She has 2 PIV in place.
.
On arrival to the CCU, her vitals were T:98.6 BP:129/59 HR:111
RR:21 O2 sat:99% on 2LNC. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
111BPM, normal axis, LBBB which did not meet Sgarbossa criteria
for MI in LBBB. She was uncooperative with exam but would repeat
single word phrases and open eyes to command. Accodring to her
husband and daughter, the patient is forgetful at baseline but
is able to have an engaging conversation and is independent with
ADLs.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yoF with PMH MS, HL, HTN, LBBB and dementia was transfered
from [**Hospital3 **] for management of newly depressed EF of
10% s/p intubation for a respiratory arrest and presumed COPD
exacerbation / PNA. Of note, she also developed PE and acute
hepatitis during that admission. On the night of transfer to the
CCU at [**Hospital1 18**] she became acutely tachypneic. A venous gas was
drawn which showed a serum bicarbonate of 14 down from 18 and a
lactate  of 8.9. She received 3 amps of bicarbonate 50 mEq and a
central venous catheter was placed. Her initial CVP was 16.
During placement of her Aline she developed a wide complex
tachycardia. She became unresponsive. A Code Blue was called and
a single, synchronized shock was delivered. She returned to
sinus tachycardia with a blood pressure is the 80s systolic. She
was bag valve mask ventilated thereafter. She received an amp of
amiodarone 150 mg and 2 amps of bicarbonate 50 mEq. Her
pressures continued to drop and norepinepherine was started for
a systolic pressure in the 60s. This was increased to the
maximum dose with systolic pressures not sustaining in the 90s.
Her initial set of labs returned with persistent lactic acidosis
with a serum bicarbonate of 26 and an svO2 of 57%. Her family
was at the bedside and felt that she would not want to be
intubated again as she was at [**Hospital3 **] prior to
transfer. Her hypotension persisted and vasopressin was added
with no effect on blood pressure. Two more amps of bicarbonate
50 mEq and 1g of calcium chloride were delivered. A femoral
arterial line was attempted. Phenylepherine was added at maximum
dose with only transient blood pressure control. Vancomycin and
piparicillin plus tazobactam were started for presumed sepsis
from an abdominal catastrophe. Her family was called to the
bedside and made her CMO. Her pressors were stopped and she was
placed on a NRB. She received several bolus doses of morphine
for comfort. She expired at 3:40pm on [**2188-11-5**].
.
# Acute hepatitis: AST/ALT trended up dramatically following
admission to [**Location (un) **] and she remained with depressed synthetic
function which is mildly worse since admission. Following a
period of unresponsiveness prior to admission, patient was
transiently on pressors and may have suffered acute liver injury
related to hypoperfusion. Other possibilities include acute
hepatitis from a toxic versus hemodynamic event (e.g.
budd-chiari). Viral and autoimmune causes are less likely given
time course. An abdominal ultrasound was performed prior to her
arrest.
.
# PE: Small subsegmental were noted PEs at [**Hospital3 **]. She
continued a heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 seconds
.
# Altered mental status: Patient was responsive to pain and
intermittantly responsive to verbal commands. Part of her
unresponsiveness is attributable to low effort. Family reports
that she is very stubborn and has mild cognitive deficit at
baseline, likely related to MS. Differential includes
infectious, intracranial processes, medication effect. A
non-contrast head CT was unremarkable.
.
# CAD: Troponins elevated at OSH with preserved GFR. CK was flat
at OSH and remained flat on admission on to [**Hospital1 **]. [**Month (only) 116**] be due to
septic physiology, PE (unlikely given size of PE). EKG showed
old LBBB and did not meet Sgarbossa criteria for MI in LBBB.
Unlikely to be acutely ischemic.
.
# CHF: Acute systolic CHF with globally depressed EF of 10% at
the OSH. Patient appeared clinically hypervolemic with
peripheral edema. DDx includes ischemic CM, toxic CM,
idioiopatic. Her cardiomyopathy was a likely underlying cause of
her death. It seems likely that hypotension from her CHF caused
ischemia of a viscera, which ultimately resulted in her death.
.
# Pneumonia: Patient started on antibiotic coverage for CAP at
OSH, repeat CXR did not show significant infiltrate and patient
was afebrile. Given her CXR, treatment for PNA was narrowed to
azithromycin alone in the brief time she was in the CCU.
However, given how short her stay was in the CCU, she did not
miss doses of her medications had they been continued.
.
# COPD: The patient started on methylprednisolone pulse at
[**Location (un) **] for COPD exacerbation. She was planned to complete
treatment for this, but expired prematurely.
.
# RHYTHM: Initially sinus tachycardia likely related to
pulmonary embolism and depressed EF. She developed a VT as above
and was DCCVed into sinus tachycardia. She expired shortly
thereafter.
.
# HTN: Patient was relatively hypotensive, likely due to
cardiogenic shock. This was likely complicated by sepsis from
hypoperfusion causing visceral ischemia.

Reason: ap/lat to assess fusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with c-spine fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ap/lat to assess fusion
HISTORY: C-spine fracture, assess fusion.

CERVICAL SPINE, TWO VIEWS.

C1 through the C7/T1 disc space is demonstrated. The patient is
status post osteometallic fusion at C6/C7, with anterior plate
and screws and intervening fusion plug. There is limited
purchase of the lower screws into the C7 vertebral body. The
plate lies approximately 7.5 mm anterior to the anterior cortex
of C7, with only approximately 3.6 mm of screw within the
vertebral body. The fusion plug is seen in the disc space, which
is wider anteriorly. There is approximately 2 mm gap between the
anterior cortex of the plug and the inferior endplate of C6,
though the deeper portion of the plug abuts both adjoining
endplates. There is approximately 3.4 mm distance between the
superior portion of the anterior plate and the anterior cortex
of C6. There is mild kyphotic angulation centered at C6/C7. Mild
prevertebral soft tissue swelling is present. Background
osteopenia and degenerative change are noted. The patient is
status post laminectomy at C3 through C7. The T1 level is not
evaluated optimally on this film. Overlying skin staples are
noted. The patient is edentulous.

IMPRESSION:
1) S/p C6/7 fusion and C3/7 laminectomy.
2) Anterior fusion plate not directly abutting vertebral bodies,
with limited purchase of screws in C7. C6/7 disc space and
graft, as described. Clinical correlation requested.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for bleed/fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old man s/p ped struck
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for bleed/fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Pedestrian struck by motor vehicle.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
or shift of normally midline structures. There is moderate
asymmetric dilatation of the lateral ventricular bodies and
atria, right more than left, with more symmetric sulcal and
fissural prominence. This likely reflects atrophy superimposed
on congenital/developmental ventricular asymmetry, as there is
no defnite focal volume loss on the right. [**Doctor Last Name **]- white
differentiation appears preserved, with moderate bihemispheric
periventricular white matter micro- ischemic change. Surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Asymmetrically prominent ventricles, likely representing
involutional changes superimposed on developmental asymmetry.








Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Orthopedic surgery and
Neurosurgery were consulted because of his injuries. He was
taken to the operating room for repair of his left open tib
fracture. He will be discharged on Clindamycin and will need to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**], Orthopedics in 1 week. He will
also need to continue with Lovenox for a total of 4 weeks.

Neurosurgery was consulted because of his cervical spine
fractures; he is being treated conservatively with a hard collar
to be worn for a total of 3 months. He will then need to follow
up with Neurosurgery for repeat imaging.

Cardiology was consulted because  atrial fibrillation; it was
recommended that he start on a beta blocker, ACEI, Amiodarone
which is being tapered and ASA 81 daily.
These were implemented.

Geriatrics was consulted as well and have made several
recommendations regarding his medications.

Speech Language Pathology was consulted, a bedside swallow
evaluation was performed; patient exhibited aspiration; he
should therefore remain NPO. A repeat swallow study will need to
be performed.

Patient underwent PEG placement in the operating room on
[**2132-6-18**]; postoperatively he had decreased urine output and has
been pre-renal; most recent labs today [**6-23**] BUN 50(47) and Cr
1.5 (1.7) He has been hydrated with IVF and has received IVF
boluses intermittently. His Foley catheter remains in place
primarily due to increased scrotal edema and decreased urinary
output. He was also treated for a UTI early during his hospital
stay; a repeat U/A was sent today; results pending at time of
this dictation.

Physical and Occupational therapy were also consulted and have
recommended rehab for patient.

History of Present Illness:
76 M with hx of multiple sclerosis, AFIB, old anterior MI,
recent UTI/C diff, hx of cervical neck fracture after MVA now
s/p failed cervical laminectomies admitted on [**8-14**] for graft
revision transferred to the ICU on POD #2 for hypoxic resp
failure. Per medical chart, pt was hit by a car on [**2132-6-12**]
causing fractures of his cervical spine and left tib/fib. he was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 67108**] and underwent an external
fixation of his left ankle along with the following proceudes
for his right C5-C6 facet fx and left C6 lamina fx:
Posterior cervical laminectomies C3-C7.
Posterior cervical lateral mass fusion C3-C7 with autograft.
Anterior cervical diskectomy C6-C7.
Anterior cervical instrumentation C6-C7.
Anterior cervical arthrodesis C6-C7 with allograft.
Pt was discharged to rehab and then to nursing home. On [**8-14**], he
was seen in neurosurgery clinic and found to have graft
extrusion on c-spine CT. He was readmitted for revision of his
graft. He went to the OR on [**8-15**] and then again on [**8-18**] for
revision of the graft. He was doing well post-op, easily
extubated each time. However on [**8-19**], pt was hypoxic from CHF,
was somewhat responsive to lasix but was admitted to the ICU on
[**8-20**] for BiPAP in the setting of CHF. He was diuresed and weaned
off the NIPPV and sent to the floor on [**8-22**] for further
management. He was continued on Cipro for E.Coli UTI along with
PO Vanco for c.dif colitis. On [**8-26**], he developed subjective sob
with a cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respiratory pattern. CHF showed improved
sob, CT head wnl. He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for
presumed asp pna. Later that day he developed fever to 105,
hypotension to BP 88/P and mild hypoxia to 94% on 2L NC with
concern for sepsis; he was given 500cc NS bolus, blood results
returned showing GN bacteremia. Antibiotics were continued as it
was felt that he had not yet failed, given that he had been on
less than 12 hours on levo/flagyl. The next day his fever and
intermittent BP drops continued and he was transferred to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU he responded to fluid boluses, never needing
vasopressors. He was switched to meropenem until results
returned with E. coli sensitive to ceftazidime in blood and
pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazizdime in uriune. He finished the
course of ceftazidime. On [**2132-8-29**] enterococcus grew in his urine
and was started on a 14 day course of Linezolid - currently on
day [**1-22**] of linezolid.  Additionally on [**8-29**] he complained of r
shoulder pain. Shoulder xray showed no acute changes.
Additionaly issues in ICU included delerium when given ativan.

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
conscious sedation. The patient was placed in the left lateral
decubitus position and the colonoscope was introduced through
the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the
cecum was reached. Careful visualization of the colon was
performed as the colonoscope was withdrawn. The colonoscope was
retroflexed within the rectum. The procedure was not difficult.
The quality of the preparation was good. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings:
 Contents: A white tube most likely the PEG tube was seen going
through the transverse colon. There was no bleeding, and no
ulceration around it.
 Flat Lesions A single angioectasia that was not bleeding was
seen in the proximal transverse colon.
 Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding diverticula were seen in
the sigmoid colon.Diverticulosis appeared to be of mild
severity.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Angioectasia in the proximal transverse colon
PEG tube seen going through the transverse colon
Recommendations: If Re bleeds while in hospital then please get
Tagged RBC scan / angiogram
If dropping HCT and has melena again after discharge - consider
Capsule endoscopy

Brief Hospital Course:
76M with hx of MS, AFIB, old anterior MI, recent UTI/C diff,
cervical laminectomies and fusion in may who was admitted for
revision of cervical fixation on [**2132-8-14**] and [**2132-8-18**].  On [**2132-8-20**]
the patient became acutely hypoxic and went to the MICU where he
was put on biPAP.  The patient transferred from the unit on the
14th, but was then sent back to the MICU for low blood pressure
that was weakly responsive to fluids.  He ultimately responded
to fluids in the MICU and pressers were not needed.  He was
transferred back to the floor on [**2132-8-29**].  On [**2132-9-2**] he was
transferred back to the MICU for melena.  GI-bleed evaluation
was performed, including EGD and colonoscopy.  Attributed to AV
malformation and patient improved with transfusion of 4U PRBC's
with HCT now stable.
.
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure: Most likely diagnosis is volume
overload in setting of elevated BP, afib, volume resuscitation
post-op. however, concerning that pt has actually worsened with
lasix and good urine output. Also on differential is pneumonia,
PE, neurogenic edema. Also, pt with smoking hx, ?element of
COPD.  Patient was started on BiPAP which he did not tolerate
and was switched to face tent.  He maintained his O2 sats >95 on
the face tent and was switched to NC prior to transfer to the
floor.
.
CTA was negative for PE.  ACE-I continued and rate and BP
controlled with lopressor to improve forward flow.  Dose of
lopressor was increased to 150mg [**Hospital1 **] the day of discharge.
Diuresed with lasix and was net neg 4L at time of transfer
.
Currently patient saturating 96% on Room air.  He is receiving
Acetylcysteine 20% for improving the clearance of respiratory
secretions.
.
2.  CHF: EF 55% with likely diastolic heart failure. As above,
need to improve afterload reduction.  Currently stable on
lisinopril and metoprolol for this.
.
3.  GI Bleed - Due to AV malformation, currently stable.
Currently on pantoprazole 40mg IV BID for prophylaxis.
Recommended to continue this regimen for 2 weeks.  Patient
underwent EGD and colonoscopy which revealed malpositioned PEG
tube and is S/P PRBC transfusion.
.
4.  Afib with rapid ventricular rate, resolved and currently in
Sinus rhythm.
- On metoprolol 25mg PO BID
- On amiodarone 200mg daily

5.  CAD: hx of MI per EKG; restart ASA per NS; troponin elevated
but likely in setting of demand with elevated heart rate and
failure
- Currently on Aspirin 81mg PO daily
.
6.  Upper quadrant abdominal pain - currently no pain
- Liver enzymes have normalized and RUQ ultrasound showed no
acute biliary or liver pathology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77743**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2165-11-18**] and taken to the Operating Room for T8-L3 anterior
fusion through a thoracotomy.  Chest tube was placed
intraoperatively. Please refer to the dictated operative note
for further details. The surgery was without complication and
the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard protocol.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she
returned to the operating room for a scheduled L3-S1 anterior
fusion as part of a staged 3-part procedure. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The second surgery
was also without complication and the patient was transferred to
the PACU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was stable.
Hospital day three she underwent a posterior fusion T8-S1. A
bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at the time of the
posterior surgery remained in place until [**2165-11-22**]. She was
transfered to the SICU where she was monitored for hemodynamic
stability.  Her left leg appeared weak and this was though to be
due to an MS flare.  Neurology was consulted for question of
steroids which they thought was not required.  She improved over
her hospital stay.  She was transfused multiple units of PRBCs
and platelets.  She was kept NPO until bowel function returned
then diet was advanced as tolerated. The patient was
transitioned to oral pain medication when tolerating PO diet.
Foley was removed on [**2165-11-25**]. She was fitted with a TLSO brace.
Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate.
Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs,
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**7-9**])
aortic valvuloplasty on ([**7-27**])
open tracheostomy with j tube and G tube ([**8-2**])


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 22782**] is a 78 woman s/p lap CCY on [**2184-6-4**] for gangrenous
cholecystitis, complicated by CBD transection. She was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-6-21**] after satisfactory placement of
a 6.3 French biliary drain through her right biliary system
through the transected proximal CBD and into the subhepatic
space. She was discharged with her PTC open and on ciprofloxacin
and micafungin to [**Hospital1 1562**] Care and Rehabilitation Center. The
plan was to let the inflammation around her gallbladder fossa
and transected CBDsubside and then proceed with surgery to
re-establish biliary continuity (likely a RnY
hepaticojejunostomy).

On [**2184-6-28**] blood cultures obtained as part of a fever workup
returned positive for Gram positive cocci in clusters. The
patient was started on vancomycin 500mg Q12hrs. She presented to
clinic today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and admitted for further treatment
of her bacteremia.

At admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 22782**] reported that she felt tired. She
complained of right shoulder pain and non-focal abdominal
tenderness. She had some back pain which seemed to be an old
issue for her. Her last fever of 100.9 was onenight ago per the
patient. She denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
anorexia, or abdominal distention.

Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-2**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened.There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-10**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 35-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior
free wall, and apex. Contractile function of the inferior,
posterior, and lateral walls appears relatively well-preserved).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is ""critical"" aortic valve stenosis
(valve orifice area approximately 0.7 cm2) (may have low
flow/low gradient component). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2184-7-2**], the left ventricular ejection fraction and
the aortic valve orifice area are further reduced.
.
Chest X ray:[**2184-7-10**]
ET tube tip is in standard position 4.8 cm above the carina. NG
tube tip is in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the
lower SVC. Cardiac size is  top normal. There is no
pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. New
right upper lobe opacity could be due to asymmetric pulmonary
edema but aspiration is also a possibility .

.
USG: [**2184-7-11**]
No portal vein occlusion. Right pleural effusion
.
Chest X Ray:[**2184-7-14**]:
Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung is unchanged. Greater
opacification in the right perihilar lung could represent
concurrent development of pneumonia.  Moderate bilateral pleural
effusion, right greater than left, is stable.  Heart size is
normal, but mediastinal veins are more engorged indicating
greater volume overload. ET tube and right internal jugular line
are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes into
the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
.
Chest X Ray:[**2184-7-16**]
In comparison with the study of [**7-14**], the monitoring and support

devices remain in place. Continued evidence of elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure with bilateral pleural effusions. It
is difficult to determine whether the opacification in the right
perihilar region reflects elevation of venous pressure or
possibly a supervening focus of pneumonia.
.
Tube Cholangiogram and Dobbhoff  placement [**2184-7-19**]:
1. Patent right-sided biliary system without evidence for leak
or stenosis.
2. Successful placement of Dobbhoff feeding tube with
post-pyloric position of tip. The tube is ready for use.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-27**]
There is trace aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve gradient
was not assessed. Left ventricular systolic function is
depressed with apical, mid to distal anteroseptal, anterior and
inferior hypokinesis (although regional wall motion was not
fully assessed). LV systolic function appears similar to that on
the [**2184-7-10**] study.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-29**]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-10**],
the aortic valve orifice area is minimally increased. Left
ventricular contractile function is significantly improved. The
increment in aortic valve orifice area is most likely explained
by improved left ventricular contractile function (low flow/low
gradient aortic stenosis)
.
CHEST X RAY:[**2184-7-29**]
IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing perihilar
opacities and moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
ABDOMINAL FLUORO: [**2184-8-2**]
IMPRESSION: Interval placement of a surgical gastrostomy tube
with the tip
seen along the right lateral margin of the thoracolumbar spine.
.
MR head [**2184-8-6**]
Small layering of old blood in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of both
lateral ventricles with findings suggestive of communicating
hydrocephalus. No mass effect or midline shift. MRA brain
demonstrates non-visualization of distal right vertebral artery
which may be due to this artery ending in PICA or due to
occlusion in neck.
.
MRA brain [**2184-8-6**]
The major intracranial vessels are visualized except the right
distal vertebral artery. There is subtle flow signal narrowing
at right MCA bifurcation which may be artifactual or due to mild
atherosclerotic disease. The posterior communicating arteries
and anterior communicating arteries are visualized. No evidence
of aneurysms or vessel occlusions. AICA is not visualized. The
left PICA is visualized. There appears to be a right AICA and
PICA configuration.
.
Chest Xray:[**2184-8-16**]
Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened since [**8-15**],
accompanied by
moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, increased on the
right, stable on the left. Heart is borderline enlarged, but the
improvement in previous mediastinal vascular engorgement
suggests a decrease in intravascular volume or pressure. Left
internal jugular line tip projects over mid brachiocephalic
vein. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
Drainage catheter in the left upper abdomen is presumably a
gastrostomy but cannot be evaluated by this view alone. No
pneumothorax.
.
Upper extremity USG:[**2184-8-16**]
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right arm.
.
FLUORO GUID PLCT:[**2184-8-17**]
Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double
lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous
approach. Final internal
length is 41 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is
ready to use.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-8-26**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
40-45%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-29**], the
right ventricle is seen reasonably well on the current study and
appears mildly dilated/hypokinetic. The degree of aortic
stenosis and mitral regurgitation are similar. The other
findings are similar.

FLUORO GUID PLCT: [**2184-9-3**]
Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 5 French
double-lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous
approach. Final internal length is 45 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Chest Xray:[**2184-9-5**]
Tracheostomy tube is in place. A left subclavian PICC line is
present, tip
over distal SVC. There is diffuse hazy opacity throughout both
lungs which likely represents CHF with interstitial and alveolar
edema, as well as
bilateral layering effusions with underlying collapse and/or
consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly
unchanged. Tubing noted over upper abdomen, not fully evaluated

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on the [**2184-6-30**].

Neuro:The patient had an episode of pupillary asymmetry,
reactive bilaterally, and decreased R arm movementon [**8-6**].  The
pupillary asymmetry had resolved spontaneously. She had
intermittent spontaneous limb movements, L>R, fluctuations in
alertness and ability to follow commands.  MRI showed evidence
of communicating hydrocephalus without midline shift,
intraventricular fluid collections; LP did not show evidence of
anyacute SAH or infection.As per neurology, it is not possible
todelineate the time course of this patient's hydrocephalus,
which could be chronic or subsequent to resolved SAH or
infection over the course of her multiple hospitalizations.  Her
mental status has been stable,she is alert and responds to opens
eyes to voice.

Respiratory:After her operation on [**2184-7-9**],she was briefly
extubated but had to be reintubated because of desaturation.The
patient failed repeated tries of extubation.She underwent open
tracheostomy on [**2184-8-1**]. However she failed to improve even
after her tracheostomy.Her chest Xray over the last 2 months
showed increasing pulmonary edema.She also developed repeated
pleural effusions that were drained thrice during her hospital
stay.Her pleural fluid were negative on culture.On the day of
discharge she was on a regimen with CPAP during the day and CMV
during the night.

CVS: The patient was started on pressors
(phenyleperine,vasopressin and Milrinone) postoperatively for
hypotension which were subsequently weaned off.Her ECHO on
[**2184-7-10**] showed LVEF= 35-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of the
septum, anterior free wall, and apex.She underwent a aortic
valvuloplasty on [**2184-7-27**] for a AS w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 cm2 pre valvuoplasty and 0.7 cm2 post
valvuoplasty.Her EF remained low
to 40% on her most recent ECHO on [**2184-8-26**].

GI:The patient underwent a roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy
performed [**7-9**].However she went to septic shock post op and was
started on tubefeeds via dobhoff.She underwent a cholangiogram
on [**7-19**] which showed no leak. She underwent a gtube and j tube
placement on [**2184-8-1**] and is being fed on through the J tube
since then.

GU:The patient went into acute renal failure.However over the
course the patient recovered spontanously with IVF resuciataion.

ID:The patient has been on ciproflocacin prophylaxis for her
biliary drain.She was treated with Vancomycin for 5 days after
admission for positive blood cultures.Post op the patient
recieved meropennem for 15 days. The patient also had C diff
infection for which she recieved flagyl for 12 days.The patient
also recieved fluconazole for positive fungal cultures from
urine.The patient also had positive coag. negative staph.
cultures on [**8-1**] from her PICC line and was restarted on
vancomycin.

Hematology: The patient recieved multiple blood transfusions
postoperatively after her gastrojujenostomy.Her Hct has been
largely stable since then.

inspisated bile that resolved. The biliary drain was replaced
with a 6 French catheter and capped. The Roux drain was removed
after the procedure. Patient had 2 episodes of hypotension to
SBP 70s that responded both times to 250 mL boluses. Pressure
remained stable at 91/43 with a heartrate of 77. PEEP was
increased to 10. [**10-1**] AM CXR showed increase in size of
bilateral moderate pleural effusions. Of note, patient has had

Chief Complaint:
Hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
3-Way Foley Placement for continuous bladder irrigation.

History of Present Illness:
82-year-old woman with history of ovarian cancer originally
diagnosed in [**2148**] s/p recurrence with metastatic spread to the
bladder in [**2160**], off chemotherapy since [**2161-5-2**], who presented
yesterday to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital with abdominal discomfort and
hematuria for 2 months. She had been taking oxycodone at home
but was unable to control the pain with this. Per ED report, she
was found at the OSH to pass large clots from the urethra. She
underwent a CT scan prior to transfer that showed tumor invasion
into both ureters, with bilateral hydronephrosis and invasion
into the bladder. Additionally at the OSH, she spiked a fever to
103, and she was treated empirically with Zosyn. She received 1u
of PRBCs and she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urologic
evaluation for nephrostomy tube placement.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were T 101, HR 96, BP 89/50,
RR 17, and oxygen saturation of 95% on RA. Labs were notable for
hematocrit of 26.5 (up from 22.5 at [**Hospital3 26615**] prior to the
blood transfusion), with INR 1.1 and normal platelets. White
count was 5.9 with 14% bandemia. The patient was bolused with 2L
of intravenous saline for systolic blood pressure in the 80s.
She was transfused a second unit of packed red cells, with a
third unit reportedly waiting to be hung prior to admission. She
was making dark red urine. Urology was not called. Three
peripheral IVs were placed - a central line was not felt to be
necessary. Vitals at time of admission were BP 83/47, RR 24, HR
83, saturation 98% RA.

Of note, in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient's code status was confirmed
to be DNR/DNI.

Past Medical History:
1. Ovarian cancer diagnosed originally in [**2148**], s/p surgery at

CT scan abdomen-pelvis with contrast ([**2161-12-5**]):
1. Increase in size of the metastatic ovarian tumor in the right
anterolateral aspect of the bladder wall which extends into the
bladder lumen.
2. Large hematoma within the bladder.
3. Significant increase in the bilateral hydroureter and
hydronephrosis, secondary to obstruction.
4. Perinephric fluic seen bilaterally secondary to forniceal
rupture.
5. Possible mesenteric implants of tumor.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Status post previous lymph node dissection.

CXR ([**2161-12-6**]):
Small bilateral pleural effusions with moderate cardiomegaly. No
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
82-year-old woman with history of metastatic ovarian cancer who
presented with worsening abdominal pain and hematuria with
imaging suggestive of tumor invasion into bilateral ureters and
bladder.

# Sepsis: The patient presented with hypotension, fevers, and a
bandemia of 14%, lactate of 2.4 and acute renal failure which
were all consistent with sepis. White count bumped from 5.9 to
20.2 the day of admission. A CXR was performed that did not show
a pneumonia. Blood and urine cultures were performed. The
patient received 2 liters of normal saline and 2 units of packed
red cells in the emergency department. Upon arrival to the ICU
the patient received an additional 2 liters of normal saline.
Intravenous fluids were provided to maintain a MAP > 60 mm Hg.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically for broad coverage
initially while blood and urine cultures were awaiting return.
The patient remained afebrile and normotensive overnight and was
felt appropriate to transfer to the medicine service. The
patient's renal failure improved significantly after intravenous
fluids and chronic bladder irrigation.  As cultures remained
negative throughout the hospitalization, her antibiotics were
discontinued on [**2161-12-8**].
.
# Hematuria: The patient had reportedly bloody urine on arrival
to the ED. The most likely etiology was considered to be from
tumor invasion into her urologic tract. Urology was consulted
after the patient arrived in the ICU and placed a 3-way foley
for chronic bladder irrigation. The patient received continuous
bladder irrigation while in the ICU and her hematuria slowly
subsided but she continued to pass clots through the foley.
Hematocrits were monitored closely with a transfusion goal of
maintaining her hematocrit of 25 and she was transfused one unit
of packed red blood cells on [**2161-12-8**].
.
# Metastatic Ovarian Cancer: Patient had known metastatic
ovarian cancer with spread to the bladder and bilateral ureters,
as described on imaging from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital. Urology was
consulted as per above. The patient's outpatient oncologist was
contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding the ultimate treatment plan. She
subsequently met with the [**Hospital1 18**] palliative care team and
decision was made to transition to home hospice care.  I called
her primary MD to let him know, and am awaiting a call back.
.
# History of Coronary Disease: The patient's statin was held on
arrival to the ICU. As well, her metoprolol and nitrate were
held due to her hypotension at time of admission. These
medicines were reintroduced as her clinical status improved -
see below.
.
# Anemia - As above
.
# Code status - DNR/DNI.  The patient met with the palliative
care team during her admission and decision made to transition
to home hospice care.

History of Present Illness:
60yo female with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] d/o who presents with
chief complaint of restlessness. Per triage note, patient was
brought in from rehabilitation center for abdominal pain. Pt
reportedly had a sexual encounter with her [**Last Name (Titles) 88306**], who is
also a resident at rehab, yesterday that involved ""rough sex.""
Patient is unable to give details of this event, but states it
was consensual. She denies any vaginal pain, vaginal bleeding,
rectal bleeding. She denies any other symptoms except for mild
headache. She states she is here because she does not want to
feel restless anymore.

On arrival to the ED overnight, initial VS: T- 99.5, HR- 100,
BP- 112/72, RR- 16, SaO2- 97% on room air. Labs were notable for
WBC 19.2 with left shift, lactate 4.5. U/A showing moderate
bacteria, > 182 wbc, large leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite.
Stox negative. Serum tylenol 6. Depakote level 69. CXR showed
LLL opacity, likely atelectasis and CT head demonstrated diffuse
global atrophy with no acute intracranial process. CT abdomen
showed ""subtle loss of the corticomedullary differentiation of
the left kidney with delayed excretion raises concern for
pyelonephritis. Mild left hydroureteronephrosis with an apparent
intraluminal filling defect in the distal ureter which is
non-specific and may represent debris, a non-calcified, stone,
and soft tissue also remains a possibility. Thick-walled bladder
compatible with clinically known cystitis.""

After CT with contrast, pt became hypotensive, developed pain,
and mottled skin. Per ED, ""presumably anaphylaxis."" Given epi,
benedryl, steroids, pepcid and symptoms resolved. Overall, in
ED, patient received ativan, morphine, zofran, ceftriaxone,
epinephrine, solumedrol, famotidine, benadryl. She received 3L
NS, and repeat lactate was 3.6.

Vitals on transfer to the floor were T- 98.0, HR- 114, BP-
126/67, RR- 26, SaO2- 100% on 3L NC. This morning she was found
to have SBP in the low 90s with some somnolence as the patient
was only responsive to sternal rub. She received 3L NS with
improvement in mental status and SBP to 100s. HR remained in
high 90s/low 100s. She was afebrile with no acute complaints.
She is being transferred to the ICU for concern of urosepsis.

Brief Hospital Course:
60yo female with history of MS, neurogenic bladder and [**Month/Day/Year **]
disorder who presents from rehab with altered mental status,
found to have E. coli UTI, bacteremia and sepsis, resolved with
antibiotics.

1. E. coli UTI, bacteremia, and sepsis- Patient presented with
altered mental status, elevated WBC, elevated lactate and
positive UA.   Imaging concerning for pyelonephritis.  She
received ceftriaxone in the ED but developed possible
anaphylaxis.   Initially treated in the MICU given sepsis with
temperature of 101 and tachycardic to the 130s.  Meropenem and
Vancomycin started in the MICU. The urology service was
consulted and they determined that the only indication for
drainage would be if there is an obstruction; she has chronic
hydronephrosis due to neurogenic bladder and reflux. An arterial
line and a central venous access line were placed and patient
given fluids. Her urine and blood cultures both resulted E.coli
sensitive to fluoroquinolones. Her vancomycin and meropenem were
discontinued and switched to cipro to complete a 14-day
treatment course (last day [**2181-9-28**]).  UTI appears related to
sexual intercourse and neurogenic bladder.  Consider post-coital
prophylaxis.

2. Altered mental status- Pt was initially lethargic upon her
admission to the MICU. She was extremely agitated on the night
of [**9-13**] and she was given seroquel and haldol which eventually
calmed her down. Her mental status waxed and waned during her
stay in the MICU and she was re-started on her home wellbutrin
and divalproex. Pt had a negative head CT. After transfer to the
floor, patient continues to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, but slowly improved over time.  AAOx3 on discharge.
Trazodone held in the setting of altered mental status, consider
restarting as outpatient when stable.

3. Possible Anaphylaxis- Patient became hypotensive to the high
70s while undergoing CT scan in the ED after receiving
ceftriaxone. She received benadryl, steroid, famotidine and
epinephrine with reponse in BP. Rash resolved by the time of her
admission to the MICU. Unclear if this is secondary to contrast
vs ceftriaxone the patient received in the ED as she has a known
penicillin allergy.

4. Multiple sclerosis- patient takes Glatiramer for relapsing
MS. She is not on any other chronic medications (interferon beta
1a, natalizumab). She is taking baclofen and detrol for history
of neurogenic bladder. Copoxone was initially held in the
setting of sepsis. Restarted on discharge.  Her baclofen and
detrol were continued at her home dose.

5. Neurogenic bladder- Patient has incontinence at baseline
without urinary retention.  Detrol held in the setting of UTI
and sepsis.  Consider restarting as outpatient.

6. Depression, [**Doctor Last Name **] disorder - Pt was periodically with
altered mental status and agitation during her stay in the MICU.
Her home buproprion and divalproex were continued.

7. Hyperlipidemia- continued on her home statin

# Transitional issues-
Pending HIV screening results, blood culture, urine culture
(will communicate to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1355**]
Restart Detrol after UTI treatment
Restart Trazodone once mental status completely back to baseline
Consider starting Bactrim DS for postcoital prophylaxis

History of Present Illness:
53 year old female with pancreatitis diagnosed [**2182-4-16**],
schizoaffective disorder, morbid obesity.  On arrival the
patient is intubated and sedated, history is largely per medical
records.  The patient presented on [**2182-5-1**] with worsening
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She initially
presented to [**Hospital6 204**] where she was febrile to
101 degrees.  She received 1 mg IV dilaudid, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV, flagyl 500 mg IV and zofran 4 mg IV.  CT of the abdomen
showed necrotizing pancreatitis with possible pseudocyst.  She
was transferred to this hospital for further management.

She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] and found to have diffuse abdominal
pain with rebound tenderness.  She received 2mg IV dilaudid and
then desated to low 80s on RA and 93% on 15L. She also
complained of CP without EKG changes.  Pt was accessed to be a
difficult airway and was intubated while awake with fiberoptics.
CT abdomen was re-read as necrotizing pancreatitis with
pseudocyst. Surgery was consulted but declined surgical
intervention and suggested holding antibiotics. The patient had
a clear CXR but got dexamethasone and combivent for possible
COPD exacerbation. She received 1 gm vancomycin for a RLE
cellulitis.  She also received zofran, fentanyl, versed and
tylenol.

On arrival to the MICU the patient is intubated but arrousable.
Able to nod head. Grimaces to abdominal palpation.  All other

Imaging:
[**5-1**] CT chest/abdomen:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis with 6.3 x 7.4 cm area of loculated
fluid adjacent to the pancreas. While this may represent
inflammatory changes from severe pancreatitis or
developingpseudocyst, infectious process/developing abscess can
not be excluded.
2. Diminutive splenic vein.
3. Splenomegaly.

[**5-1**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to low lung volumes and
patient rotation to the right. Superior mediastinum remains
prominent. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year old female with morbid obesity presenting with
necrotizing pancreatitis and respiratory failure.

Necrotizing pancreatitis: Unclear etiology. She has had a
cholecystectomy and does not consume etoh. Lipids normal.
Lipase was already low by the time of arrival here. CT with
necrotizing pancreatitis and a fluid collection. Her WBC's came
down  and she has not had fever so concern for secondary
infection was low. Her exam was reassuring as her abdomen is
soft, but with some tenderness. She continues to have some
residual pain so an N-J tube was placed to start jejunal tube
feedings. She will be discharged with a plan to remain NPO and
on only tube feeds until pain free, then diet should be slowly
advanced. Would be conservative with diet advancement as her
diet was advanced fairly quickly during her prior admission and
her conditioned worsened. Would consider having GI and nutrition
follow at LTAC. As she has no clear etiology of this episode,
she has f/u with a pancreatitis specialist in 4 weeks here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. When it is time to advanced her diet she passed s/s eval
with no restrictions. A picc was placed to facilitate IV meds
and lab draws(she has very difficult peripheral access).

Respiratory Failure:With diuresis the patient was weaned an
extubated. At the time of discharge we suspect that she is
euvolemic to slightly volume up, although difficult to assess by
exam. Would monitor i/o closely and given lasix 40 IV prn to
keep even.

OSA:Patient has OSA but refused CPAP.

Pain/anxiety: Can be given morphine IV or po.

RLE cellulitis: Resolved. Completed course of Cephalexin.

Anemia: Hematocrit stable.  Likely from critical illness.

Hypertension:  Blood pressures stable. continued to hold home
enalapril

Schizoaffective disease: The patient is well compensated. In
discussion with psychiatry it is unclear if she actually carries
the diagnosis of schizoaffective d/o. No hallucinations or
delusions noted.

Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine

Type II Diabetes: Regular insulin sliding scale q6 was done with
TF. Januvia was stopped out of concern for medication induced
pancreatitis.

Asthma: albuterol prn

Access:PICC, confirmed in upper SVC

HEAD CT [**2126-10-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval mild enlargement of the left superior
cerebellar
hyperdense area with mildly increased mass effect. Clinical
correlation is
recommended. While this is most likely to represent hemorrhage,
DDX includes dense neoplasms like meningioma; underlying
vascular or neoplastic causes cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 4223**] was admitted to the NeuroICU after a CT showed
cerebellar hemorrhage. Her neurological status was monitored
very closely and remained unchanged throughout her hospital
course. Her INR was reversed to a goal of less than 1.5 A CTA
was desired for rule out vascular cause of bleed. Due to her
renal insufficiency a MRA was recommended.  Given her exterme
claustrophobia, an open MRI was scheduled after discharge.

On [**10-6**] it was noted that there was some swelling to her right
neck- a soft tissue ultrasound was done which was negative. She
subsequenty had one 15 minute episode of Left chest discomfort.
Cardiac work up was unimpressive and cardiology consult felt
that there were no acute cardiac episodes.  She was evaluated by
PT and ultimately discharged home.

temporal lobe with small temporal lobe contusion. She was
brought to [**Hospital1 **] where she was intubated due to recurrent vomiting
and inability
to protect her airway. GCS was 13 upon arrival to ED. Of note,
the husband states that she has daily headaches and usually
takes advil or exedrine daily.

CT Head:
FINDINGS:
Within the left temporal and occipital horns, there is extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage (2, 13 and 2, 12). Near the left
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2, 11), there is a large area of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage measuring approximately 2.0 x 3.0 cm. This appears to
have increased in size when compared to most recent prior exam.
There is a 2 mm wide, contiguous left subdural hematoma
identified. There is no definite acute fracture or soft tissue
swelling identified although tiny foci of gas is seen in the
extraaxial space adjacent to the mastoid air cells (102, 69).
There is a small amount of fluid seen in the left mastoid air
cells. The basilar cisterns are visualized, and there is no
significant shift of normally midline structures. The patient is
intubated and a large amount of secretions in the posterior
nasopharynx is identified. The posterior ethmoidal cells are
also opacified (2, 14).

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsened left temporal and occipital extensive subarachnoid
hemorrhage with focal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
temporal lobe. No significant shift of midline structures.
2. 2 mm wide left subdural hematoma.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2156-6-28**] 3:11 AM
1. Left temporal hemorrhage with associated edema. No evidence
for
herniation, although there is slight narrowing of the ambient
cistern on that region. No other intrparenchymal foci of
susceptibility are identified.
2. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage, left convexity subdural,
tentorial
cerebelli, and posterior fossa subdural hemorrhage.
3. Moderate chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic
changes. Mild
bilateral diffuse parenchymal and cerebellar volume loss.
4. No evidence for acute infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 y/o female with history of multiple sclerosis came to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH with the diagnosis of SAH. She was seen to have
worsening SAH on CT scan performed here and admitted to
neurosurgery for further workup. She was placed on lamictal and
tegretol for seizure prophylaxis. On physical exam left sided
weakness was appreciated. On [**6-28**], patient's exam was worse, left
sided weakness was more prominent and neurology was consulted
for MS. It was recommended to obtain EEG.

On [**6-29**], patient's exam was much improved. Left sided weakness
was still appreciated but [**3-28**] in upper extremity and [**1-29**] in
lower extremity. Patient is A&Ox3. The EEG showed no seizures.
Neurology will see her as an outpatient and they requested an
MRI as an outpatient as well. PT/OT evaluated her and
recommended home PT. She was also instructed to use her AFO that
she has at home.

The patient was felt to be neurologically improved and was
discharged with her husband on [**2156-7-1**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Extubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 y/o gentleman with CAD, diastolic CHF,
self-reported multiple sclerosis, schizoaffective disorder,
narcissistic personality disorder, which contribute to his
frequent medication noncompliance, and multiple admissions &
intubations for COPD exacerbations. He presented to the ED with
shortness of breath and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory
failure which required intubation in the ED.
.
Of note, he has no documented PFTs but he is prescribed COPD
medications. When he is admitted, CXR usually does not show
hyperinflation or pulmonary edema, usually does show asymmetric
atelectasis (right worse than left).
.
He was last hospitalized for COPD in [**2124-3-30**], and was last
intubated in [**2123-4-30**]. He came to the ED today complaining of 2
weeks of fever/chills/cough/gradual dyspnea, with acute
worsening of his dyspnea over the past day. He was extremely
nervous, was tachypneic to the 40's, and had difficulty speaking
more than one word at a time.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99 rectal, BP 123/79, HR 132, SaO2
low 90s%, RR12.
He was diaphoretic and cool, and had expiratory wheezes. No
peripheral edema. He was given Solumedrol 125mg, Abx, and nebs.
He was persistently tachycardic despite small fluid bolus. He
was tried on BIPAP and nonrebreather with SaO2 100%, but he
continued to be tachypneic to the 40s. He became less responsive
and was intubated.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is intubated and sedated on Propofol,
arousable to painful stimulus but not following commands.

Past Medical History:
COPD s/p multiple intubations: h/o refusal to use prednisone or
BIPAP. Not on home O2 due to insurance issues.
CAD s/p ""at least 3"" MI's with multiple cardiac
catheterizations, per patient report
chronic diastolic CHF
steroid-induced diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled
Multiple sclerosis per patient: states he was diagnosed 2 years
ago, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 12838**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 69783**]. However, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 12838**] had no record of patient.
Diverticulosis s/p bowel resection

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY FROM THE ICU:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50y/o gentleman w/ little confirmed PMH and
underlying psychiatric disorders and substance abuse who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being intubated for respiratory
distress.
.
#. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure:
Unclear etiology. Pt agitation likely playing a role as he was
significantly agitated in the ED before intubation. In the past,
he has had similar presentations and improved clinically after
treatment for COPD, though he has no documented obstructive
disease and low lung volumes on CXR convincing for COPD. Per pt
there is diagnosis of CHF, but TTE showed normal EF and only
mild LV dilatation and did not appear grossly volume overloaded
on exam. Pt was started on oral prednisone and
albuterol/ipratropium inhalers and azithromycin for presumed
COPD flare. There was low suspicioin for PNA. Tox screen
negative except for benzos/opiates in urine on sample taken
after pt given both for vent sedation. BNP was 57 and 144 on
repeat. CTA showed resolution of right upper lobe consolidation
since [**2123-5-22**] with residual bilateral lower lobe and right
middle lobe atelectasis and new superior segment of left lower
lobe consolidation. No evidence of central PE. Concern for
increased shunt fraction and so ECHO with bubble study was done.
Poor study with no evidence of shunt on bubble portion with ECHO
showing mild symmetric LVH. LV cavity is mildly dilated. There
is mild global LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40%). Bronchoscopy
showed mild mucous plugging and yielded negative culture data.
Initial attempt made to taper oral steroids but stopped at 40mg
due to worsening wheezing. Then pt stated that oral steroids did
not help him and refused to take them, so IV methylprednisolone
was started and then tapered. Pt very agitated on vent but
showed improvement in lung status. There was concern for volume
overload [**2-1**] to resuscitation contributing to hypoxia, and IV
lasix was started on [**9-20**] with good response. Extubated on [**9-22**]
and transitioned to PO lasix on [**9-23**]. Still requiring large
amounts of O2 via nasal cannula once extubated and lungs still
very congested but able to maintain O2 sats.
.
#. CAD with Sinus Tachycardia:
Intial question of intravascular volume depletion. Pt also with
past history of tachycardia and was on diltiazem at some point
in the past for this. Pt reporting 3 past MIs but no
documentation available. ASA started on admit. EKG showed ST
depressions with T wave inversions and signs of old ischemia.
Cardiac enzymes negative x 3. EKG did not change during ICU stay
except prolongation of QT interval with Haldol as noted below.
Continued to be tachycardic, worsen in setting of frequent
agitation and activity. Did not report increased chest pain
during these episodes.
.
#. Agitation/Psych Disorder:
Pt with unclear psych history but multiple social work and
psychiatry notes in OMR describing interactions consistent with
personality/psych disorder. Pt very agitated while on vent,
questionably delirious. Given haldol 5mg initially for delirium
but QTc interval abruptly widened to 493ms from 458ms. Pt
switched to Seroquel with further QTc prolongation, up to 505ms
before it came back down. After pt extubated he was agitated and
was trying to leave. Psych consult obtained and they deemed that
the patient does not have the capacity to make this decision.
They recommended switching anti-psychotic to Risperidone (so
that both PO and IM forms would be available in one
antipsychotic for fear that multiple antipsychotics would have
additive impact on QTc). This was done and pt agreed to stay.
.
#. Hypertension:
Pt was initially hypotensive (SBP 60) peri-intubation per the
ED, but this had stabilized with fluid boluses by time he came
to the ICU. BP meds were held. Fentanyl/Midazolam used for
sedation to help with BP. Arterial line was placed and BP
monitored. On [**9-20**] pt briefly hypotensive and MAP transiently
below 60. Pressors were briefly started in context of some
concern for infection at the time but then peeled back as BP
stabilized. BP stayed on the low end of normal for the rest of
the ICU admission.
.
#. Positive Blood Cx:
One out of four of initial ED blood cx turned positive for GPC
on [**9-20**]. Vancomycin started over concerns that GPC sepsis
contributing to presentation. Vanco stopped after 2-3 days when
Cx results came back CONS in [**1-3**] bottles which was thought to be
a contaminant in light of overal clinical picture.
.
#. Vascular access:
Initially Pt with R IJ placed in ED. This site was contaminated
during Bubble Study ECHO and new CVL was placed with
contaminated line removed. Pt later had new IJ removed and then
lost peripheral access requiring IR fellow to place PIV for
access for meds.
.
#. Social:
When pt presented there was no contact information available in
the chart. Multiple past SW notes indicated some episodes of
behavioral outbursts and questionable reports of medical issues
per pt. SW was able to find some contact information and pt was
discussed with brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 69787**] who is next of
[**Doctor First Name **]. He expressed concern about illicit drug use. Another
cousin, [**Name (NI) 11894**] [**Name (NI) 69788**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 69789**] who is the ""hcp"" was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and she said she would be in to the hospital shortly
but never presented during the ICU stay. A friend was also
contact[**Name (NI) **] who stated that the patient had some psychiatric
issues and also raised the question of drug abuse.
Course on the Floor: Patient was transferred to the Hospital
Medicine Service on [**2124-9-24**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old man with chronic mental illness/
narcissistic personality disorder/ schizoaffective disorder,
long history of sCHF and COPD, and self-reported multiple
sclerosis. His current presentation seems most consistent with a
COPD and CHF exacerbation. He was intubated in MICU. Of note, he
had a new decline in his LVEF while critically ill, with global
hypokinesis.
.
# chronic mental illness negatively impacting his medical care:
His course has been notable for a challenging personality style
with frequent demands to guide his care and refusals of
recommended medical care and treatments.  On [**2124-9-25**], a Code
Purple was called when he became very upset with Nursing and
Physician staff about his care, though was not able to be
specific about what his major concern was. Psychiatry consult
attending Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had the capacity to
understand his situation and was able to decide to leave the
hospital against medical advice. However, Mr. [**Known lastname **] ultimately
decided to stay in the hospital. His Clonazepem and Oxycontin
were re-started at lower doses than his [**2124-3-30**] discharge,
since he had been without them for 7 days.
.
# steroid-induced diabetes mellitus type II:
His course has also been complicated by marked hyperglycemia.
Glargine was started as well as an insulin sliding scale and has
been titrated up. He refuses a diabetic diet, sometimes refuses
insulin, and he adamantly requests Ensure shakes with each meal
despite their high carbohydrate load. He eats whatever he wants.
.
# persistent hypoxemia and dyspnea:
On [**9-28**] his breathing was more labored, and he was diaphoretic
with persistent cough and hypoxia. Solumedrol was increased to
125 mg. CXR showed possible RML infiltrate so he was started
empirically on levofloxacin for nosocomial pneumonia. On [**9-29**]
his respiratory status was unchanged but he was more emotionally
labile and acutely agitated, particularly after the solumedrol
125mg doses were administered. The dose was therefore decreased
back to 80mg. As he was not clinically improving, sometimes on
the verge of returning to the ICU, Pulmonary was consulted on
[**10-1**]. They recommended adding vancomycin for the nosocomial
pneumonia as well as substituting tiotropium for the
ipratropium. In addition, they recommended a chest CTA to r/o
PE, but we were unable to obtain this due to lack of peripheral
IV. He had a PICC line, and he adamantly refused any further
attempts at a PIV due to his prior difficult experiences with
vascular access. In addition, the Pulmonary team recommended a
tracheal CT to look for tracheal stenosis or
tracheobronchomalacia, and the study showed no TBM.
.
# acute systolic and diastolic CHF:
He was diuresed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and in the early part of his floor
course, then he was switched back to his outpatient oral lasix
dose. He then had significant osmotic diuresis due to his marked
hyperglycemia (300-400s), so no further IV lasix was thought to
be necessary.
.
# self-reported multiple sclerosis:
Patient reports he previously had a neurologist in [**State 2748**]
but hasn't seen one in two years. He had been tried on different
therapies but didn't know details. He felt that his had tremors
were getting worse, and he wanted Neurology consultation during
this hospitalization. Given his tenuous respiratory status, this
was deferred.
.
Remainder of hospital course:
For the final week of hospitalization, which ended after Mr.
[**Known lastname **] left AMA on [**10-7**], is as follows:
He was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for possible
nosocomial pneumonia.  CXR on [**10-6**] showed no infiltrates.
He continued to have lower extremity edema, with no response to
massive diuresis.
He was seen by the [**Last Name (un) 387**] for resistant steroid induced
hyperglycemia, and started on an aggressive sliding scale with
improvement.
.
Ultimately on [**10-7**] - he was suspected of not taking his
oxycontin and pocketing them.  He on that day also lowered
himself to the ground with jerking movements in the presence of
the nurse, similar to prior episodes.  He was then confronted by
security due to concern for his behavior with the oxycontin.  He
was found to have 2 oxycontin in his pocket which he gave to the
nurse.  He subsequently demanded to leave AMA.  His PICC was
removed.  The risks of leaving against medical device were
detailed for Mr. [**Known lastname **], and he expressed understanding that he
faced the risk of death, respiratory failure, or significantly
worse health outcomes.  He had previously been seen by
psychiatry and evaluated for his understanding of these risks at
that time as well.  He ultimately left the building with
security.  On future admissions, his oxycontin and klonopin
usage should be carefully monitored.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-10-8**] via transfer
from [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital for surgical management of his coronary
artery disease. He was placed on heparin for anticoagulation.
The cardiac surgical service was consulted and Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Ciprofloxacin was
started for a urinary tract infection. As he had an episode of
chest pain, intravenous integrillin and nitroglycerin were
started. On [**2188-10-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three
vessels. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated
with amiodarone. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. CPAP was used given his
history of sleep apnea and severe COPD. On postoperative day
three, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. On
postoperative day four, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] had a reaction to percocet
which caused him to be profoundly sedated. Narcan was given with
complete resolution of his symptoms. Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] developed a left
leg cellulitis and keflex was started. An ultrasound was
performed which was negative for a deep vein thrombosis. As his
urine culture remained positive on ciprofloxacin, macrodantin
was used in its place. As his diet improved, his oral diabetes
agents were resumed.

Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on [**2188-10-27**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] is a 42-year-old man with a history of MS who
presents with worsening lower extremity weakness over 7 days. He
is wheelchair-bound at baseline due to his MS, but in the last
5-7 days he has noted progressive worsening of his weakness:
whereas he is normally able to pull his knees up to his chest,
he
now is unable to move his LEs at all. This occurred in the
setting of some respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production,
nasal congestion); his wife had bronchitis 2 weeks ago. Notably,
he has felt some chest tightness over the last 1-2 days, and has
felt he's had a weak voice and been mildly SOB over the last
day.
Although he acknowledges that his MS has been getting slowly
worse over the last few months (and he has been bed-bound since
a
hip injury 3 months ago), he is certain that this is different,
and a much faster loss of function. He denies any urinary or
bowel symptoms and has no saddle anesthesia.

On neuro ROS, he denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention.

On general review of systems, he denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies chest pain
or tightness, palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits.  No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.
Denies rash.

CXR- no infiltrate

MRI OF THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE, W &W/O CONTRAST,
[**2140-2-29**]-
FINDINGS: There is mild straightening of the cervical lordosis.
Stable multilevel degenerative changes consistent with minimal
posterior disc bulge at C2-C3 and C6-C7, at this level producing
mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, left greater than
right, which also is associated with left uncovertebral
hypertrophy.

In the spinal cord, again, there are subtle hyperintense foci
detected on T2, there is no evidence of new lesions or abnormal
enhancement. In the thoracic spine, also the previously
described lesions at T8 and T11 are poorly visualized and
demonstrates no evidence of enhancement. The configuration and
signal intensity in the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine
as well as the neural foramen at different levels appear normal.

The paravertebral structures demonstrate resection of the
previously described sebaceous cyst on the left paravertebral
area.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in the interim. There is no
evidence of new lesions or abnormal enhancement. The previously
described sebaceous cyst on the left parasagittal region on the
soft tissues has been removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26211**] is a 42-year-old man with a history of secondary
progressive MS who presents with 5-7 days of progressive
bilateral LE weakness in the setting of a recent URI. His neuro
exam was [**Known lastname 28051**] for a spastic paraparesis, decreased
proprioception, preserved reflexes.  Development of significant
respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure as course
progressed.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Respiratory failure therefore thought to
be related to overall generalized weakness. He became unable to
clear his secretions and generate sufficient cough.  He had
mucous plugging to such a degree that he was unable to ventilate
large portions of his lung. He was intubated for bronchoscopy
[**3-9**], secretions suctioned. Bronch [**Month/Day (4) 28051**] only for some thick
secretions without other lesions.  Given continued poor
ventilatory mechanics, he remained intubated and eventually
required trach for continued pulmonary toilet on [**3-17**].  He
tolerated this procedure well. He continues to require the
ventilator but will further be weaned at rehab.
.
# MS exacerbation: Secondary progressive. Intially admitted to
the neuro ICU for monitoring of respiratory capacity given
initial differential included GBS. Prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28051**] for
significant cervical and thoracic disease demyelinating disease.
MR C and T spine +/- gado was repeated this admission without
evidence of active MS lesions. He was treated with high dose
steroids followed by taper and has currently completed the
course.  His weakness did not improve as rapidly as desired,
necessitating trach and rehab placement as above. A later MRI
brain even following steroids showed a new demyelinating lesion
in the medulla.
.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia:  He had consolidations on CXR
also in the setting of mucous plugging.  His sputum from [**3-10**]
grew Acinetobacter.  He will complete a 10 day course of
meropenem for treatment of this.
.
# Generalized weakness: His progressive weakness was concerning
for neurological process, flair of MS vs other
neuropathy/myopathy process. EMG was performed, consistant with
central process (MS) with possible mild overlying ICU myopathy.
MRI performed with new lesions concerning for progression of MS.
 There was no evidence of GBS or other neuropathy/myopathy from
his testing.
.
# B12 deficiency: Received usual monthly injection of vitamin
B12 IM on [**2140-2-29**].

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2130-8-29**]):    NO GROWTH.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. PEs: Pt with massive bilateral PEs involving all lobes and R
heart strain. She was initially started on Heparin gtt. This was
held in the ED and TPA was given. Hypotension and hypoxia now
improved - pt is hemodynamically stable. Etiology unclear - may
be because pt sedentary [**2-21**] to MS or the ESTRING which was
recently started (vaginally). No known malignancies. Active T&S
was maintained prior to transfer to floor as were two peripheral
large bore IVs. Started on coumadin [**8-28**] and will likely need
life time anticoagulation as she sedentary due to MS.  She
improved quickly with normal hemodynamics.  On [**2130-8-30**] INR =
3.2.  IV Heparin was discontinued and Warfarin was moved to 4mg
qhs to start evening of [**2130-8-30**].  PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 12872**] and pt's N{
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4643**] were informed (phone/email) about current treatment
plan. They will take over INR monitoring and make sure that
ESTRING is removed upon arrival to [**Hospital1 1501**].  (Pt preferred ESTRING
removal to be done there).
.
#. MS: Pt with MS c/b fatigue, urge incontinence, has suprapubic
catheter in place. The patient's outpatient medications were
continued, including baclofen, oxybutinin, neurontin, and
provigil prn. Urinalysis showed no pyuria, no leukocyte
esterace, no nitrite but urine cultures were sent and returned
>100K Stenotophomonas Maltophilia.  Pt was afebrile and without
any new symptoms. I assume this is contamination vs.
colonization.  Repeat UCx showed no growth.
.
#. Osteoporosis: Stable on outpatient fosamax and vitamin D.
.
#. Psych: Stable on outpatient Buspar, and Zoloft.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 37 year old female with refractory celiac disease,
intermittent partial SBO, lypmphocytic colitis, hypothyroidism
and dysautonomia who presents with severe mid-abdominal pain
since last Friday. She endorses sharp mid abdominal pain with
nausea and vomiting as well as diarrhea. The symptoms subsided
somewhat over the weekend and then recurred Monday afternoon. In
particular, she has complaints of severe mid abdominal pain,
which she says feels similar to the pain she had when she was
diagnosed with a partial small-bowel obstruction. Of note, the
patient has known intermittent jejunal intussusception on recent
MRE. The patient has also noted [**Known lastname **] in her stool, which is new
for her, though she reported that she does have hemorrhoids. At
baseline pt has chronic RUQ abdominal pain and watery diarrhea,
and has frequent dietary indescretions documented in her GI
notes for her Celiac Disease. She was seen at [**Hospital3 3583**]
[**2178-1-19**] where she was given 500 cc of fluid for tachycardia and
discharged home. She was subsequently seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic
today where she was noted to be orthostatic and was sent to the
ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
T 98.7 HR 134 BP 122/73 RR 20 O2 Sat 100% RA
She had a CT abd/pelvis with PO contrast that showed dilated
loops of small bowel with potentially thickened small bowel wall
distally, likely from partial SBO versus distension from
underlying celiac disease. Surgery was consulted and felt there
was no indicaiton for surgical intervention. She received 1.5L
NS in the ED with improvement in her tachycardia. She was given
Dilaudid 4mg IV, Morphine 8mg IV and Zofran 4mg IV. There were
no laboratory abnormalties.
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were:
T 98 BP 120/80 HR 100-120s RR 18 O2 Sat 100% RA (intermittent
destats)
She endorsed L sided chest pressure which is non exertional,
lasts hours and resolves spontaneously. Denies assocaited SOB,
lightheadedness or palpitations. States she is able to walk
several flights of stairs, denies DOE or exertional CP.
Otherwise, states abd pain is improved with Morphine.

FOUND.

CT A/P ([**2178-1-20**]):
Mildly dilated loops of small bowel with potentially thickened
small bowel loops, both findings potentialy due to patients
underlying celiac disease, less likely from partial SBO however
clinical correlation suggested. No current intussuception.

KUB [**2178-1-22**] There is no free gas or
pneumatosis. A moderate amount of barium is present throughout
the colon,
from previous CT study. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction. Scattered phleboliths are present bilaterally in
the pelvis. There is linear subsegmental atelectasis in the left
lung base.

KUB [**2178-1-25**] No evidence of bowel obstruction.

MRE [**2178-1-23**]
1. Mild nonspecific dilated loops of small bowel which could be
secondary to celiac disease. No MR [**Name13 (STitle) 72443**] features to
definitively suggest celiac disease.

2. Mildly prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, nonspecific.

CXR [**2178-1-21**] No acute intrathoracic process



Brief Hospital Course:
37F with past medical history notable for celiac disease,
lymphocytic colitis, intermittent partial SBO, hypothyroidism
and paroxysmal sinus tachycardia with a question of dysautonomia
presenting with severe epigastric pain, hematochezia, nausesa,
vomiting, dirreah, orthostatic hypotension, and sinus
tachycardia.

#   ABDOMINAL PAIN
Patient has a complex GI history notable for refractory celiac
disease, lymphocytic colitis, intermittent partial SBO, and
asymptomatic jejunal intussusception.

Patient had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course of abdominal pain
throughout her stay. Her initial presentation was notable for
the epigastric pain that she thought was similar to her prior
SBO symptoms. General surgery was consulted, and there was no
evidence of acute obstructive process. Repeat KUBs were negative
for obstruction. Gastroenterology was involved throughout her
entire stay. Her pain has gradually evolve to be worst at the
RLQ and eventually at RUQ. Her LFTs and amylase/lipase were WNL.
She tolerated regular gluten free diet and continued to have
flatus. A trial of elemental diet was aborted due to poor
tolerance. Her constipation was treated as below. Her pain was
attributed to celiac (Her tTG level was elevated upon admission)
and constipation. Patient's pain was controlled with tylenol
standing plus oxycodone PRN. MRE was notable for nonspecific
dilated small bowel. There was no definitive evidence suggestive
of ulcerative jejunititis. Patient was given three day course of
high dose IV steriod. Her overall abdominal symptoms improved.
Patient still had her baseline RUQ pain by the time of
discharge. Rheumatology was involved given her [**Doctor First Name **] positivity.
The rest of serology, including ANCA, RF, Ro, La, dsDNA, SM, RNP
were negative and they did not think that a rheumatologic
disorder was contributing. Patient was discharged with the plan
to taper steroid intake until her outpatient GI follow up.
.
# CONSTIPATION
She was constipated despite multiple bowel regimens (Colace,
senna, miralex lactulose, Magnesium citrate, bisacodyl pr,
enema). Patient ambulated and was encouraged to increase fluid
intake. She was having 1 small bowel movement every other day by
the time she was discharged and was given erythromycin orally
for the last 2 days of her hospitalizations.
.
# HEMOATOCHEZIA
Patient presented after one episode of bright red bleed per
rectum and subsequently had two additional episodes involving
small amount (reported by patient) here. Patient has a known
history of hematochezia, and patient reported this was similar
to her prior hemorrhoidal bleed. Guaic stool however was
negative. Patient's Hct remained stable.
.
#  SINUS TACHYCARDIA/ORTHOSTASIS
In the MICU, her HR ranged 110-130s but otherwise remained
hemodynamically stable. Outside cardiologist was [**Name (NI) 653**], who
said this has been a chronic issue for her related to multiple
factors, including her anxiety and pain. Albuterol was held. Her
HR was controlled < 100 with fluid resuscitation and maintaining
euvolemic state, metoprolol succinate 25 started [**1-22**] (which
patient had tried outpatient setting in the past), and klonipin
PRN. SBP remained stable at 100-120s. She had only several
additional episodes of non-sustained sinus tachycardia on the
floor, in the setting of what patient thought to be anxiety
attack. Patient was advised to follow up with her outpatient
cardiologist on this issue.

# Question of multiple sclerosis with history of recurrent
paralysis
Her neuro exams upon transfer to the medicine floor was only
notable for mild left lower extremity weakness and upper motor
signs with upgoing toes on the left. This remained unchanged
throughout the remaining hospital course. Patient had no other
additional deficits.
.
# Hypthyroidsm:
TSH upon admission was high. Patient was maintained on her home
levothyroxine regimen. She remained asymptomatic.

# Transitional issues:
- Steroid taper to be continued by gastroenterologist
- patient will follow-up with outpatient gastroenterologist
- Continue strict gluten free diet
- Cardiology f/u regarding long term management of sinus
tachyrcardia
- Neurology f/u regarding the question of multiple sclerosis
- Retest TSH once acute issues resolve
- Patient remained Full code during her hospitalization

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-1-20**] for abdominal pain,
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, and lightheadness
when standing-up. You had one day stay in the intensive care
unit to monitor your rapid heart rate. You were transferred to
the regular medicine service the next day.

Your heart rate remained intermittently high in the 100-130s,
but slowly came down to the normal range of 60-100s before your
discharge from the hospital.  The improvement in your heart rate
came after we gave you IV fluids and started you on a medication
called metoprolol.  You should continue to take this medication
after you leave the hospital.

Your [**Date Range **] pressure remained stable. Your lightheadedness
resolved. You were able to walk around without difficulty by the
time you were discharged. We did not see anything abnormal on
your electrocardiogram (EKG) to suggest any problems with [**Name2 (NI) **]
supply to your heart.

Your abdominal pain unfortunately continued to be an ongoing
issue throughout your stay. Your liver and pancreas tests were
normal. The test for your celiac disease showed evidence of
active inflammation. Imaging showed some small bowel
abnormality, likely due to your celiac disease. Your bloating
and constipation were treated with colace, senna, miralax,
bisacodyl and simethicone, milk of magnesia, enemas, and
lactulose. You were also followed by the GI doctors, who
recommened intravenous steroids for 3 days and starting
erythromycin all of which seemed to help your symptoms.  You
were transitioned to oral steroids and tolerated those well.

It is important that you continue to maintain a gluten free diet
and continue to take metoprolol and your other medications. We
also recommend that you try to switch to the generic brands that
do not contain gluten, as we have listed for you below:
- Amitriptyline: [**Location (un) 20872**], Qualtest, [**Last Name (un) **]
- Levothyroxine: Lannett, [**Last Name (un) **]
- Metoprolol: Apothecon, NovaPharm, Watran (uses potato starch)
- Oxycodone: Mallindnat

These medications are gluten free:
- Duloxetine
- Montelukast

We have made the following changes to your medication list:
- DISCONTINUED morphine
- ADDED metoprolol succinate (for heart rate control)
- ADDED acetaminophen (Tylenol)
- ADDED oxycodone (as needed for pain)
- ADDED prednisone 60mg daily x 2 days and then decrease it to
40mg daily until you follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Please continue to take your other medications as you have been
doing.

Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 72444**] office on [**2-2**] to set up an
appointment within the next 7 days.

Chief Complaint:
68yo F transferred for acute onset of speech difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated for airway protection in the setting of delerium
tremens.

History of Present Illness:
68yo RH F h/o EtOH abuse, heavy smoking, HTN, CAD s/p MI in
[**2150**] and h/o MS who was well until last night. Her daughter came
home and discussed the hospitalization of the patient's brother
around 6pm. The patient then went upstairs and was in her room
for the rest of the night. Around 9:30pm, the patient first had
difficulty speaking in that her speech was slightly slurred. She
did not report this to her daughter and is able to offer this
information to multiple yes/no questions at this time. Details
of
the history were provided by her daughter, as the patient has
severe difficulty articulating her words.

The patient woke this morning and walked downstairs. The
patient's daughter noticed a new right facial droop (that the
patient says was not present last night). She was only able to
say a few words and what she said was so slurred as to be
incomprehensible. She was taken to [**Hospital3 2783**] and
transferred here. Her speech difficulties were far worse than
last night. She denies visual disturbances or diplopia and
denies
other deficits such as gait difficulty, dizziness,
incoordination, headache, neck pain or manipulation,
numbness/tingling.

ROS: On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.

No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough,
shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

[**2154-11-6**] CTA with perfusion:
1. Hypodense areas in the left frontal lobe, including
involvement of the anterior sylvian region, compatible with
acute infarction. Increased mean transit time is visualized on
the perfusion images along the superior margin of this area,
also supportive of recent ischemia and/or infarction. No
significant mismatch between blood volume, flow and MTT is noted
to suggest significant salvageable tissue or penumbra.
2. Non-occlusive filling defect in a sylvian branch of the left
middle cerebral artery, although the area of recent infarction
is probably not primarily supplied by the vessel containing the
filling defect.
3. Prior left cerebellar infarct.
4. Emphysema.
5. Lucency about the lateral root of [**Doctor First Name **] 3, which could
represent a periodontal abscess or dentigerous cyst. When
clinically appropriate, dental consultation is recommended.

[**2154-11-6**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Normal
biventricular systolic function.

[**2154-11-9**] CT-head without contrast.
IMPRESSION: Evolution of the left-sided anterior division middle
cerebral artery infarct. No hemorrhage. No other significant new
abnormalities since the previous CT of [**2154-11-5**].

[**2154-11-11**] MRI head:
IMPRESSION: Acute infarcts of the left frontal lobe and insula
not significantly changed in extent compared to CT scans.
Moderate degree of chronic microangiopathic changes and an old
infarct of the left cerebellum.
The previously seen filling defect of a branch of the left MCA
is not definitively seen on the MRA.

[**2154-11-7**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 129. Compared to
previous
tracing cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the floor on [**2154-11-5**].  On [**2154-11-6**]
the patient had new onset afib with rapid ventricular response
(HR to 156) and blood pressures dropping into the low 100s.  The
patient was transferred to the ICU so that pressors could be
hung as we were concerned that her low blood pressure might put
her at further risk for ischemic injury in the setting of her
recent stroke.  Furthermore it was felt likely that the
patient's stroke was caused by the afib itself, as this was new
onset and the patient was not previously anticoagulated.  The
patient was placed on Neo-Synephrine to maintain systolic blood
pressure over 120.  She was also started on a diltiazem drip to
facilitate rate control, but this was felt not to be ideal as
the blood pressure effects of the diltiazem was counteracting
the effects of the Neo-Synephrine.  Therefore the patient was
started on an amiodarone gtt for rate control and the diltiazem
was stopped.  The patient still required the neo gtt to maintain
adequate pressures.  She was eventually transition to PO
amiodarone.  Unfortunately she was still in and out of atrial
fibrillation and a cardiology consult was required.

On the morning of [**2154-11-8**] the patient began to withdraw,
showing the first signs of delirium tremens - she was agitated,
disoriented, and combative.  These behaviors were in [**Doctor Last Name 29943**]
contrast to her otherwise perfectly pleasant demeanor.  The
patient was initially started on a CIWA scale but was requiring
large doses.  She was started on a lorazepam gtt.

The patient was felt to be at risk of not protecting her airway
and shortly after being started on the Ativan gtt she was
intubated.  She was briefly on a propofol gtt and receiving
regular ativan as the SICU team felt that she was at high risk
for withdrawal related MI or seizures and as she was also very
combative. This was explained to her family.

Regarding the patient's stroke, this was seen both in the CTA
perfusion performed on the day of admission and in the MRI
performed on [**11-11**].  An ECHO did not demonstrate a cardiac
source for the embolus.  The carotids had no significant
stenosis on the CTA of the neck.  A hemoglobin A1C was 4.8.
The total cholesterol was 173 and the LDL fraction was 82.
Simvastatin 40mg daily was started.  Given the likelihood that
the patient's stroke was cause by her atrial fibrillation the
patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin was given as
well.

A urine culture was positive for E.coli and Stenotrophomonas.
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin on [**2154-11-10**] and
completed a 3 day course. Her repeat UA was negative.

The patient was noted to be increasingly anemic with a HCT of
27.4 on [**2154-11-12**] from 38.4 on admission.  The MCV was noted to
be elevated.  Folate and B12 were normal or elevated.

The patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.

The patient was given famotidine and tube feeds were initiated
while she was intubated. After a prolonged intubation, she was
gradually weaned off sedation. She then took several days before
waking up enough to be extubated. After extubation, she was also
noted to have large bilateral pleural effusions. She therefore
had an IR guided thoracentesis which showed a transudate, with
negative gram stain and culture. She was therefore not treated
with antibiotics.

She has had persistent expressive aphasia with aphonia. She was
evaluated by   Speech who noted a possible L vocal cord
paralysis. She was then seen  by ENT who noted that her vocal
cords are mobile, but she had large posterior gap and
significant laryngeal edema. She was therefore started on [**Hospital1 **]
Protonix. She was also re-evaluated multiple times for
aspiration and failed. A J-G tube was therefore placed
surgically as IR was unsuccessful. During this time she was off
Coumadin, reversed with FFP and on a heparin drip. Her INR on
discharge was 2.1 and she was on Coumadin. She was discharged to
rehab and will follow-up with Neurology as an outpatient. Her
LDL should be maintained less than 70 and HbA1c less than 7.

Chief Complaint:
abdominal distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 42 year old man with multiple sclerosis, Bipolar DO,
hypothyroidism, who was admitted on [**1-19**] from nursing home
because he was found to have increasing abdominal distention
over past few days, which patient says he has noticed for past
few weeks. In the ED, patient was found to have marked
small-bowel and colonic dilatation on imaging. NG tube was
placed and drained 1 litre of bilious/brown fluid on
presentation, and drainage continued throughout MICU stay. He
was also febrile to 101 in ED and was started on ciprofloxacin
and metronidazole (for bowel pathogens) which were continued. He
was admitted to MICU for marked hypertension and transient
respiratory distress that resolved with supplemental oxygen. His
blood pressure was controlled with IV hydralazine, but this may
have precipitated a truncal rash that developed later during the
day. He also received agressive IV fluid hydration for total of
4 litres. Creatinine improved from 1.5 on admission to 0.9.
Patient was evaluated by surgical service and GI consult team
and the consensus is currently [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome secondary to
autonomic neuropathy from multiple sclerosis. He spiked another
fever at 10:30am to 101.5 and blood cx, urine cx, and stool cx
were sent. Leukocytosis has resolved. He continues to have
marked abdominal distention and some tenderness in
peri-umbilical region. He had one large, liquid stool today.
Rectal tube was placed with only minimal stool drainage since.
Patient says he has not tried to eat for several weeks due to
vomitting and diarrhea. He has been NPO since admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Pseudocolonic obstruction-- This was thought to be likely [**3-7**]
neuropathy from MS, but GI infection was considered given fever,
leucocytosis, and diarrhea. He was initially admitted to the
MICU and surgery and GI were consulted. Lactate trended
downward, and stool cultures were negative. C diff was neg x 2.
Abdominal distention improved and his leukocytosis resolved. An
NGT was placed for decompression. He was transferred to the
floor after overnight observation. He received neostigmine on
[**1-22**], and by [**1-24**] his symptoms were improving and the NGT was
removed. He began eating and having regular bowel movements, and
by [**1-28**] colonic dilatation had totally resolved on KUB.
Laxatives such as lactulose or enulose were recommended to be
avoided as they may cause gas and thus more abdominal
discomfort.

#) Fever/leukocytosis. His WBC was 17.3 on admission but his
leukocytosis resolved within 2 days and he defervesced. C diff
neg x 2. Stool cx neg. Campylobacter neg. Blood cx from [**1-22**]
with 1/4 pan-sensitive staph aureus and Vanco was started on
[**1-23**] that was changed to nafcillin [**1-24**]. Urine cx showed no
growth. Further surveillance blood cultures were negative, with
cultures from [**1-24**] and [**1-25**] still pending. He will complete a
course of nafcillin for 2 weeks (last day [**2122-2-5**]).

#) Hypertension: He was on lasix and metoprolol as outpatient.
Metoprolol was continued but lasix was held due to copious urine
output and the need to retain hydration due to hypernatremia.

#) Hypernatremia: Na increased to 150 on [**1-22**] but improved to
141 [**1-24**] AM s/p D5W and stayed in the normal range after he
began to take POs.

#) Seizure disorder: Depakote was continued.

#) Bipolar disorder: Depakote and lithium were continued. A
lithium level measured during his hospitalization was normal
(0.5)

#) Hyperlipidemia: Zocor was continued.

#) Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine was continued.

#) Multiple sclerosis: he is not on treatment currently but this
may be re-evaluated as an outpatient with his neurologist, Dr.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 4657**] - [**Location 1268**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: colonic pseudo-obstruction
Secondary: multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, hypertension,
seizure disorder, hypothyroidism


Discharge Condition:
good, stable, eating a regular diet, having daily soft bowel
movements, afebrile, with some residual abdominal discomfort


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with symptoms of colonic obstruction. You
received consults by the surgery and gastroenterology services,
and you received a medication called neostigmine to help relieve
the obstruction. With conservative measures, your symptoms
improved until your colon was normal size by x-ray and you were
able to tolerate a regular diet and have regular bowel
movements. Your abdominal discomfort may take a couple more
weeks to fully resolve. You may take stool softeners to help you
have bowel movements but you should avoid lactulose or enulose
as they may cause gas and thus more discomfort.

If you stop having bowel movements or are unable to keep down
food or liquid, call your doctor.

One of your blood cultures was positive for an organism called
Staph aureus. You will continue IV antibiotics for 1 more week
through your PICC line, and then the PICC line may be removed.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up with your doctors at your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] nursing facility.
Blood cultures from [**1-24**] and [**1-25**] were pending at the time of
discharge; your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] follow up on the results of these.

Imaging:
Femur XRAY ([**10-14**])
R femur fracture: Right femur fracture.

Proximally, a fixation plate and screw complex is noted
supporting the hip
and distally there is a minimally displaced oblique vertical
fracture at the lateral aspect of the distal metaphysis of the
femur. The distal fragment overall shows good apposition with
the proximal fragment and the distal fragment shows slight
deviation anterolaterally from its donor site. There is no
additional fracture site more proximally.

Echo ([**10-16**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is probably mild left
ventricular hypertrophy (views are suboptimal). The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with probably normal free wall contractility. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (probably trileaflet). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is at least moderate to
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 yo F w/hx of severe COPD who presents with R femur
fracture and difficulty breathing.
.
#. Respiratory Status: On admission, patient was comfortable on
3L NC which is home rate. Differential included COPD
exacerbation vs. worsening of respiratory status secondary to
pain and femur fracture. She does not signs of PNA or infection
on CXR and no other symptoms of fever or cough. Respiratory
status is most likely baseline. Unclear why she has such severe
lung disease given relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15403**] smoking history, but she
was only taking an albuterol inhaler at home. On [**10-14**], patient
developed increased work of breathing. ABG had increased PaCO2
to 100s, put on BiPAP, repeat ABG showed same PaCO2 100s, and pt
intubated. She was maintained on albuterol nebs, ipratropium
nebs, and budesonide nebs.  After intubation pressures dropped
to 60/40's, started on pressors, which were soon after weaned.
Extubation was attempted on [**2164-10-20**], but patient failed and was
reintubated less than an hour later [**3-19**] hypoxia/increased work
of breathing.  She became hypotensive again after reintubation
and was again started on 3 pressors, which were eventually
weaned. She was also started on steroids at that time (IV
methylpred eventually switched to PO prednisone-will require 2
wk taper). It was decided that she could not tolerate extubation
[**3-19**] poor respiratory reserve and she was taken for trach/PEG on
[**2164-10-25**].  It should also be noted that she completed a seven day
course for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia with
vanco/cefepime/ciprofloxacin.

.
#. Femur Fracture: Likely secondary to osteoporosis and possibly
from prior steroid use. Unclear why she is not on calcium and
vit D and/or bisphosphonate.  She was started on these inhouse.
She was taken to the OR on [**2164-10-16**] for ORIF of right distal
femur. She was started on prophylactic lovenox 30mg [**Hospital1 **] on
POD#1. She will need her staples removed on [**10-30**] (2 weeks post
op).
.
#. Cardiac: On admission, ectopy on ECG-Likely secondary to low
electrolytes. Electrolytes were aggressively repleted. Concerned
that labile bp's could be [**3-19**] ischemia, got ekg which looked
same as priors (inflat q waves) and trop which were neg.   Got
OSH records which showed that pt had recent NSTEMI in [**7-24**]
and also has cardiomyopathy c EF of 20%. Repeat Echo showed
EF>55%, mild LVH, normal LVEF, dilated RV, with moderate to
severe PA systolic HTN.
.
#. Anemia: Likely [**3-19**] iron deficiency. Hct at OSH was 37 in [**Month (only) **]
[**2164**]. Hct inhouse ranged 24-28. Vitamin B12 and folate were
normal. Iron supplementation was held on hospitalization because
of infection (VAP). She was also transfused multiple times to
keep HCT at goal in light of previous NSTEMI. Likely also some
component of bleeding after surgery.
.
# HTN: Blood pressures labile, coreg d/c'ed on this admission as
intermittently needed pressors as above and COPD not well
controlled. Lasix was used, as patient has been mostly positive
during her admission. Now that pressors weaned, BP's in 130's
systolic. Lisinopril was started at a dose of 2.5 daily.
.
#. Nutrition: Patient has history of anorexia. She was initially
started on remeron. Eventually after intubation she was
transitioned to tube feeds. She had PEG placement on [**2164-10-25**].

#. Trigeminal Neuralgia: continued carbamezepine, amitriptyline,
gabapentin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname **],
You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] after you fell and fractured your
hip.  You required intubation for respiratory failure and we
were unable to wean you off the ventillator due to you
underlying lung disease.  You were also treated for a pneumonia
during this admission.  You underwent a tracheostomy and PEG
tube placement during this admission.

Followup Instructions:
Please call to schedule follow up in the Ortho Trauma Clinic
with either Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-20**] weeks.  The
telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1228**].

Please make an appointment to see your primary care doctor, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1356**] 1-2 weeks after you leave the rehab facility.
Please discuss with her that we stopped your plavix and also
that we stopped your carvedilol since it can make your lung
disease worse, and instead started you on a medicine called
lisinopril.

Clinical:  Tracheal bronchomalacia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 56072**] was admitted on [**2114-11-14**] with increased shortness of
breath and cough and underwent a flex bronchoscopy which
revealed recurrent severe distal tracheobronchomalacia.
Pulmonary was consulted and recommenced increasing her Nexium to
40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Flovent and Serevent.  GI was consulted and
recommended aggressive reflux management.  On HD #2 her cough
and wheezes persisted and she was started on pulse steroids.
ENT was consulted to assess her vocal cords which was normal.
Her symptoms improved slightly and underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy and silicone stent placement on HD #6.  Her
respiratory status continued to improved and the stent was
removed on HD#8.  On HD #9 ([**2114-11-23**]) she underwent successful
Redo right thoracotomy, Removal of previous bronchoplasty Marlex
mesh, Suture bronchoplasty of the right bronchus intermedius,
coverage with a pleural flap buttress, flexible bronchoscopy and
right lower lobe wedge resection. Post-operative pain was
controlled with an epidural catheter which was later switched to
a PCA. Two chest tubes were placed intraoperatively. Pt was
extubated [**11-23**] and remained in the ICU post-operatively and was
oxygenating well with a face mask. Pt was advanced to a regular
diet on [**11-25**], was transferred out of the ICU to a regular floor
bed, the chest tube was removed and the chest [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
placed to bulb suction. During the night of [**11-22**] pt had a
decreased respiratory rate and oxygenation due to over
narcotization and was given Narcan, supplemental O2, and a
nebulizer with good effect. On [**11-26**] the pt underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy which showed normal clearing airways. Pt was
switched to oral pain medication on [**11-27**], supplemental oxygen
was weaned, [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed, and central venous line was
removed. peri-operative Levofloxacin and Vancomycin were
completed on [**11-30**]. Pt was discharged on [**12-1**] tolerating a
regular diet, pain well controlled with oral medication, and
ambulating without assistance.

MS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
35 yo RH female with h/o MS diagnosed in [**2165**], who has had rapid
decline for the past five months.  MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to steroids
per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**], patient's neurologist at [**Hospital1 **]. Patient has
been on multiple medications but recently being treated with
Copaxone, but was stopoped because she wanted to get pregnant.
At 5 months, her symptoms worsened to the point that she
underwent an elective surgical abortion at [**Hospital6 **]
on [**2174-11-1**].  Over the past 3-4 weeks (after the abortion), she
has significantly declined so that she is completely unable to
feed or take care of herself.  She has had slurred speech but
this has gotten progressively worse over the past few weeks.
Her muscle spasms have also worsened so that her entire body
jerks (she pulls her legs up to her chest) and has been unable
to sleep.  Yesteray, she was trying to get to the port-a-potty
from the bed and fell to the ground.  She then activated her
life alert and EMS came to the house and transported her to
[**Location (un) **].

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **].  Her initial evaluation
showed a temp of 99.2.  CXR and UA were neagtive.  Laboratory
data was reportedly unremarkable.  This morning, she was found
unresponsive this morning and brought down to the ICU.  ABG
showed a pH of 7.11and CO2 of 67, she was trialed with BiPap
wihtout improvement and was intubated for acute hypercapneic
respiratory failure.  A CT was obtained, which showed multiple
areas of low attenuation in the white matter c/w multiple
sclerosis plaques (CT not available for review).  She was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] MICU.

ROS:  Low grade fever for the past few weeks, and chronic cough.
No shortness of breath, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
MS diagnosed in [**2165**] - presented with bilateral wrist swelling
and pain

Social History:
Patient lives at home with her daughter.  She has visitng
nurses and is wheelchair bound.  She has been unable to walk for
years now.  Smoke 10 cigarettes per day since [**80**] years of age.
She has been wheelchair-bound for the past few years.  There is
a
physical therapist, social worker, and nurse's aid that comes to
the house.

Family History:
Maternal cousin with MS.  Maternal grandparents with cardiac
disease and diabetes.

Physical Exam:
Exam:  Vitals:  Afebrile HR 92  RR 28   BP 102/91   RR 28   100%

General:  Arousable, mildly agitated, ET tube in place
HEENT:  No conjunctivitis, nares clear, partically visualized OP
clear, no LAD
CV:  Tachycardic, no murmurs
Pulm:  Clear bilaterally with good aeration
Abd:  Soft nondistended, nontender, NABS
Extremities:  Warm and well perfused

MS:  Able to follow some commands with reptition - shows a
thumb,
grasp and ungrasp hand, opens eyes.  She has only mild cognitive
slowing, is able to convey a detailed history accurately but
takes approximately 30 seconds to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] back.

CN:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light,  5 to 3 mm
bilaterally, right RAPD. Visual threat bilaterally.  Optic disc
margins sharp.  Eyes midline, +OCRs, tending to hold head to the
left.  Facial movements symmetric. Intact gag reflex and cough
reflex.

Motor: Decrease bulk and increased tone in all extremities
(upper<lower).  She is essentially plegic in the legs with only
minimal movements with effort.  Strength in arms is good with
only 4+ to 5- weakness in UMN distribution but marked ataxia
limits functioning.  Spontaneous movement of all her extremities
but
appears to move her left more than right.

Pertinent Results:
Head MRI:  Findings consistent with demyelinating disease
involving bilateral cerebral white matter, midbrain and pons,
bilateral cerebellar hemispheres with some of these lesions
showing enhancement.

Cspine: 1.  Cervical spondylosis with disc desiccation. 2.  C3-4
left lateral disc osteophyte complex causing indentation on the
thecal sac and touching the left C4 nerve root. 3.  Lesions in
pons, medulla, bilateral cerebral hemispheres and the cervical
cord, which could represent demyelinating disease.  However, no
definite enhancement is noted.  However, the contrast images are
of poor quality for accurate assessment.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)  Neuro:  Patient was seen by Neurology and started on
Solumedrol.  Because of the late progression of the disease, the
Copaxone was discontinued because of likely ineffectiveness at
this stage.  She was given a 5 day course of steroids without
much improvement in her function.  Because of this, she was then
started on plasmapheresis for 5 treatments.  She currently has a
suspicious urinalysis, therefore, we will defer Cytoxan
treatment until she has completed a course of antibiotics.

Because we had to initiate Cipro treatment for her UTI and it
interacts with Tizanidine, her home medication of Tizanidine 4mg
QID was discontinued.

2)  Resp:  It was felt that her respiratory decompensation was
likely due to her fragile state from the MS but the initial
trigger is unknown.  Soon after admission, she was extubated to
nasal cannula without difficulty.  She was then weaned to room
air and was off oxygen for the remainder of the hospital course.

3)  FEN/GI:  She was unable to take oral feeds and initially
failed her swallow evaluation.  A bedside NG tube could not be
placed.  However, after extubation, her alertness improved and
she was able to swallow some soft foods.  Her diet was slowly
advanced and by the time of discharge, she was tolerating thin
liquids and soft solid foods.  Because of the time it takes to
eat and chew her food, we have continued a mainly soft diet but
allowing solids in addition to it.

4)  ID:  On [**12-5**], she spiked a temperature and had a
leukocytosis.  Her urine, clood cultures, and CXR were negative.
 She did not have any symptoms.  After 48 hours, her fever and
leukocystosis resolved without any treatment.  Early [**Month (only) 1096**],
as part of her infectious workup prior to starting Cytoxan, a
sinus CT and CXR were obtained, which were negative.  A UA was
also obtained and was suspicious and her culture grew skin
flora; however, because she had previously been febrile with a
leukocytosis and Cytoxan therapy will be immunosupressive, we
have opted to treat her with a 7 day course of Cipro.

5)  Heme:  Patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia with
a low MCV and iron studies consistent that were with the
diagnosis.  We have initiated iron therapy.  Her hematocrit has
been stable and she has been asymptomatic.

6)  Muskuloskeletal:  She received PT and OT throughout the
hospital stay and has had great improvement of her upper
extremity strength.

7)  Skin:  She developed a small decubitus ulcer at her coccyx.
She was switched to an airbed and duoderm dressings were
started. Wound care team followed her while inpatient.

stents on [**2-27**], colon CA, who presents w/ melena and 10 pt Hct
drop over 24 hours, while on [**Month/Year (2) **], [**Month/Year (2) **], plavix. lovenox. Pt
required 8U PRBC, 4U FFP and one bag of platelets.  Give
persistant GI bleeding and falling hematocrit, Mr. [**Known lastname 19755**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t an urgent EGD.  Given his history of laryngeal cancer
s/p XRT, he was electively intubated prior to the EGD.  The EGD
revealed erosion at the site of the insertion of the G tube at
the second portion of the duodenum (the G tube had advanced into
the duodenum) and another erosion with a blood clot.  Both
ulcers were injected with epinephrine.  A clip was applied at
the base of the ulcer with clot.
.
After the EGD, Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] hematocrit remained stable at 36
and he was extubated successfully on HD #2.
.
Per discussion with the patient's primary care physician,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] will not be restarted.  Aspirin and clopidogrel may be
reinstituted, probably ~7 days from discharge, in concert with
recommendations from Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] primary care physician and
[**Known lastname 1106**] surgeon.
.
Surgery was consulted regarding the G-tube.  They repositioned
and re-secured the G-tube.  A G tube study was obtained that
demonstrated appropriate filling of the stomach and tube feeds
were restarted.  After confirming with the rehabilitation center
Mr. [**Known lastname 19755**] was previously cared for at, he was restarted on
a heart healthy, diet.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71861**] creatinine was initially elevated above his
baseline in the setting of hypovolemia, but returned to baseline
after appropriate resuscitation with blood products.
.
Patient had 2 episodes of 14 and 18 beat VT on [**2131-3-10**]. Vital
signs were otherwise stable. We replaced his electrolytes to
keep his potassium > 4.0 and his magnesium >2.0. He will follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2077**] on [**2131-3-15**].

Chief Complaint:
Questionable non-convulsive status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 59yo woman with h/o MS, seizures, and hypothyroidism
who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after a 10 day stay
there.  She was initially admitted with a GTC seizure and has
been essentially obtunded since this time.  She is transferred
out of concern she may be in NCSE.

She was initially admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital  on [**2102-7-7**] with
hallucinations, tachycardia, and hypernatermia.  She was
agitated
and had periods of visual hallucination.  She was diagnosed with
delirium related to nicotine withdrawal, benzos, Keppra, and ?
infection.  She went to the ICU and her electrolytes were fixed.

She was put on Haldol for agitation which was effective.  She
apparently stayed confused at times, but was better oriented
(x2).  Her neurologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**], felt she was having partial
complex seizures and increased her VNS.  She was also restarted
on Tegretol and had initiation of VPA therapy.  She improved and
was transferred to rehab.  They mention that her admission was
also for exacerbation of MS, but it is unclear from the
discharge
paperwork exactly what this referred to.

She was then readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-27**] when she was
witnessed to have a GTC seizure of unknown duration.  She had no
fever or WBC ct, but was noted to be essentially obtunded since
admission.  Her Teg level was 7 and VPA was 72.8.  CT head was
done and showed ""mild involutional change and chronic white
matter disease"" only.  CXR and ECG normal.  They evaluated for
infection with nothing found. An LP was not performed.  They
reduced her Haldol to 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 5 [**Hospital1 **] as she was very
sedated.  This made no difference.  Neuro was consulted there
and
they were concerned about NCSE.  She was therefore transferred
to
the ICU there and received IV ativan(unknown dose).  At this
time, she became somnolent(from her previously agitated state)
and had pinpoint pupils.  Repeat head CT was unchanged [**8-2**].
Labs as below were unremarkable.  She had a repeat UA which was
largely positive and she was started on levofloxacin today.  She
also had her VPA dose doubled to 500 [**Hospital1 **].  She was transferred
here for higher level of care, including ability to manage VNS
for MRI, and for possible need for continuous EEG.  She had EEG
at initial hospitalization, but not at last one.  She has not
had
an LP.  No tox screens were sent.

HCP is [**Name (NI) 14492**] [**Name (NI) 916**], her brother (cell=[**Telephone/Fax (1) 67971**],
home=[**Telephone/Fax (1) 67972**]). MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 39662**]). I
attempted to contact but was not available at time of pt
arrival.

Past Medical History:
-Multiple Sclerosis
-Seizure disorder-apparently partial complex seizures, but
unclear of exact semiology. Another reference mentions frontal
lobe seizures. Pt has a VNS. EEG [**7-18**] was slow theta rhythm
generalized with no epileptiform activity. No EEG done during
most recent hospital stay.
-Anxiety
-Hypothyroidism

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 59yo woman with h/o MS, seizures, and
hypothyroidism who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after a
10 day stay there.  She was initially admitted there after a GTC
seizure and has been agitated or sedate since the admission. The
concern at this time by the neurologist there was that she may
be in NCSE.  There was also apparently a question of whether her
VNS may not be functioning.

On admission, she was essentially obtunded, but did have
movement in all extremities. She did not follow commands. She
has a vagal nerve stimulator implant and was unable to receive a
CT or MRI. She was transferred to the stroke service for
evaluation.

Patient had a portable EEG to assess for non-convulsive status
epilepticus which was abnormal due to the slow and disorganized
background and due to the sharp features and additional slowing
on the left side. The first two abnormalities signify a
widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and
subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
infection are among the most common causes. There was additional
focal slowing suggesting a subcortical dysfunction in the left
hemisphere. The sharp features may be part of the same
abnormality and were not clearly epileptiform. Lumbar puncture
was normal with negative gram stain, RPR was non-reactive, and
HSV PCR was not detected.

Patient was on multiple neuroleptic medications which was
thought to contribute to the encephalopathy/delirium. Haldol and
VPA were held. The VPA level was within therapeutic range prior
to stopping it. Tegretol was continued for seizure control.
Patient was on Baclofen for spasticity from multiple sclerosis
but was also held as it can cause sedation. She was resumed on
levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and effexor for
depression/anxiety.

On morning after admission, patient was awake and alert, able to
make eye contact. She was oriented to place but had low
attention span requiring repeated questioning to elicit replies.
She was able to follow commands, though with difficulty. Her
speech was slightly dysarthric and she was perseverating.
Neurological exam noted for intact cranial nerves, weakness in
all extremities, moderate increase in muscle tone, brisk
upper/lower reflexes, intact sensation, and mild ataxia. On
discharge, patient's mental status and neurological exam has
remained unchanged, even though she has been more awake and
aware of her surroundings.

Patient was hypernatremic throughout her hospital course and it
is likely from dehydration prior to arrival indicated by
elevated BUN and creatinine. Her free body water deficit was
calculated to be almost 4L and was administered free water
through IV and PO routes. Her serum Na on discharge has trended
down to less than 150, as the patient's alertness had improved,
leading to more free water intake. It should continue to be
encouraged.

She had a repeat EEG two days after admission to correlate
clinical neurological improvement likely due to decrease in
encephalopathy.  It revealed no focal changes and normal
background. She was unable to obtain a head MRI due to vagal
nerve stimulator implant and lack of information regarding its
functional status since here neurologist had been unavailable.

Patient will remain on tegretol for seizure prophylaxis. She
will followup with PCP and neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**]. She is
being discharged to rehabilitation facility.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 96228**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-28**] she was brought directly to
the operating room where she underwent an ascending aorta
replacement, aortic valve replacement, and coronary artery
bypass graft x 1. A IABP was placed in the operating room as
well. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Initially after surgery in the
OR and ICU she had episodes of atrial fibrillation and was
started on Amiodarone. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. IABP was
removed on post-op day two. She required aggressive pulmonary
diuresis and toilet for several days and remained in the CVICU
until post-op day seven due to her poor pulmonary status.
She was transferred to the floor and was aggressively diuresed
and weaned slowly down on oxygen.  She had a serratia UTI on
[**9-1**] and was treated with Cipro.  She continued to work with
physical therapy and was discharged to home on POD#9 with home
PT and home oxygen therapy in stable condition.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2405**] is an 83 yo female with PMH of CAD, COPD, MS, and
seizure disorder who awoke on the morning of admission at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with non-productive cough and rhinorrhea.  Her O2 sats
were 90-94% with a RR of 24 and she was afebrile. Mild stridor
was noted in the nursing records.  She was able to eat lunch,
but then developed worseing desaturations to 90% around 1:30.
She was given Zyrtec 5mg and combivent nebs with some subjective
improvement.  At 3:15, she was noted to have increasing
respiratory distress, SpO2 85% on RA and RR 38 --> 96%/3L,.  She
was given 60mg PO prednisone.  Given the acuity and failure to
improve with above meds, she was sent to the ED.

Per her daughter, she had a pna this winter, confirmed by xray.
This was managed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  She also said that her she
has witnessed her mother choking while eating very often.  She
previously used CPAP at night, but stopped using it because of
discomfort.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3 113 148/106 32 98.
She presented in severe respiratory distress with a
nonrebreather.  She was described as lethargic and struggling
for breath.  She was not intubated because of a DNR order in her
chart.  There is also a comfort care order, but the significance
of that was unclear and her family was unreachable.  She became
hypotensive to 62/36 and was given peripheral levophed without
central access because of the ambiguity of her advanced
directive.  Her WBC was 14.1 (85%N, 11%L).  HCT was 40.5.  Her
lactate was 1.8.  Chemistries were unremarkable, CEs were
negative x 1.  A proBNP was 203.  She was given
vanc/levo/flagyl.  She was given 125mg of methylprednisolone as
well [**Doctor Last Name **] albuterol/ipra nebs.  She was given IVF.  A CXR was read
as difficult to interpret given patient motion, possible
infiltrates vs effusions bibasilly, large lucency under left
hemidiaphragm either distended stomach or free air.  Because of
that, a CT abd was obtained.

Per daughter, she is alert and recognized daughter and
son-in-law, not uncomfortable.

On the floor, her breathing is labored though she otherwise
appears comfortable.  She speaks in [**1-27**] word sentences.  She
currently denies and SOB or difficulty breathing.

IMAGING:

Chest X-ray [**2104-6-22**]
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
exam is suboptimal due to patient motion and a repeat is
recommended.
Grossly, thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen. There is suggestion of
loss of
vertebral body height at multiple levels. Patchy opacities at
the lung bases could be due to patient motion, although
effusions and consolidation cannot be excluded. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette cannot be
evaluated. Lucency in the left hemidiaphragm could relate to a
distended gastric bubble, although free air is not excluded.
Recommend clinical correlation and repeat imaging as able.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-6-22**] 7:19 PM
1. No pneumoperitoneum.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease, including a prominent
ascending aorta as well as focal aneurysmal dilation of both
common iliac arteries.
3. Extensive bony demineralization as well as scoliosis and
marked
compression deformities throughout the visualized spine.
4. Likely post-surgical changes from a left nephrectomy.
5. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female with PMH of COPD, multiple sclerosis, CAD presented
with hypoxic hypercapneic respiratory distress, altered mental
status, and hypotension.

#. Respiratory distress: Worsening respiratory distress at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab requiring non-invasive ventilation in the setting
of worsening mental status.  ABG showed acute respiratory
acidosis.  Physical exam suggests COPD flare with possible
causes including pneumonia and/or aspiration.  Mental status
changes likely due to hypercapnea.  She received nebulizers and
BiPAP in the ED with improvement.  History of CPAP/BiPAP use
suggests history of hypoventilation.  She is a definite DNI per
her daughter who is HCP.  For initial therapy was treated with
Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV TID and broad spectrum antibiotics
for possible pneumonia including Vancomycin / Levofloxacin /
Flagyl.  She improved rapidly within hours of being in the ICU
which was more suggestive of an aspiration event with subsequent
pneumonitis.  Her steroids were rapidly tapered on day #2 to
Prednisone 40 mg with plan to taper over the following 3 days.
Flagyl was also discontinued [**2104-6-24**] and vanco was discontinued
on [**6-25**] after speciation of GPC in blood culture from [**6-22**] as
coag-neagtive staph.  Levofloxacin was continued for planned 5
day course. Rapid viral testing and urine Legionella were
negative.  She was continued on nebulizers both standing and as
needed, and received cough syrup and benzonate for cough.

#. Hypotension: Concerning for infectious etiology with
distributive shock.  She met SIRS criteria for RR, HR, and
leukocytosis.  She received IVF in the ED but required
peripheral Levophed.  Volume status was difficult to assess
clinically.  She had no central access, but the family would
allow it in the future if we felt it was appropriate and
indicated.  Arterial line was placed and SBP rapidly improved to
SBP 120s.  Central access was ultimatley not needed.  She was
continued on Levofloxacin for possible pneumonia with planned
course of 5 days.  She was also continued on Vancomycin until
[**6-25**] when speciation of positive blood culture from [**6-22**] appeared
to be a contaminant.

#. Altered mental status:  Upon admission was noted to have
mental status changes in the setting of possible infection and
hypoxemia.  Treated with antibiotics.  Improvement with BIPAP
also suggests hypercapnea, though no ABG was drawn upon arrival.
 Other etiology could include seizure given history of seizure
disorder on Dilantin, though no report of seizure activity.
Dilantin level low but did not adjust given no known seizure for
20 years and rapid improvement with BiPAP and antibiotics.

#. COPD:  Treated with steroids, antibiotics and nebulizers as
above.

#. Seizure disorder:  Reportedly no seizures for decades, though
mental status changes upon arrival.  Dilantin level low but did
not change dosing given low suspicion for seizure.  Dosed
Dilantin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 200 mg daily per pharmacy
recommendations.

#. Troponin elevation (NSTEMI): Patient with elevated troponin
the day of admission.  This was thought to be due to demand
ischemia given her respiratory decompensation.  Troponins were
quickly downward trending.  She was continued on her home
simvastatin, and aspirin was increased to full dose of 325 mg PO
daily. She should follow up with her PCP to discuss increased
dose of statin (likely indicated if tolerated) and beta blocker
(possibly beneficial if able to tolerate in setting of known
COPD).

#. CAD: Continued on statin and full dose aspirin as above.

#. Multiple Sclerosis: No current active problems.

#. Hypothyroid: Continued on Synthroid.

[**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
- Hypoxia
- Hypotension
- Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction

Secondary:
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Coronary artery disease


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with
shortness of breath and confusion. When you arrived in the
emergency department, you were also found to have low blood
pressure. You were given medication to stabilize your blood
pressure as well as BIPAP and oxygen to help your shortness of
breath. You were started on a steroid taper to treat a possible
COPD flare, and antibiotics to treat a possible infection. You
were also seen by the speech and swallow team, who determined
that although you are able to swallow soft food, thin liquids,
and pills safely, you need to be very careful when you eat or
you could aspirate food particles or fluid into your lungs.
Indeed, an aspiration event like this may have been the original
cause of your symptoms of shortness of breath. With treatment,
your blood pressure stabilized and your breathing improved.

While you were in the ICU, blood tests showed that you had a
minor heart attack. You did not experience symptoms or chest
pain with this heart attack, but you will still need to follow
the recommendations of your primary care doctor closely as
changes to your medications may be necessary.

We have made the following changes to your medication regimen:
- COMPLETE TAPER of prednisone (20 mg tomorrow [**2104-6-26**] and 10 mg
the next day on [**2104-6-27**])
- COMPLETE COURSE of levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth daily (last
dose [**2104-6-27**])
- INCREASE DOSE of aspirin to 325 mg by mouth daily unless or
until directed otherwise by your PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) 99071**] DOSE of dilantin to 100 mg by mouth twice daily

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 100**] Rehab
([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] or one of her associates) when you are back to your
regular floor at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab (out of the MACU). Please ask your
doctor to discuss management of your COPD and to review your
medication list. Your doctor may consider increasing your statin
dose or beginning a medication known as a beta blocker.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo woman with a h/o DM, MS, HTN and frequent
UTIs [**2-8**] chronic foley who presented ""not feeling well.""  She
states she was in her usual state of health until one week prior
to admission when she felt tired. She states that three nights
prior to admission, she experienced severe back pain which is
one of her UTI symptoms. The following day she was prescribed
Levaquin for a UTI. On day of admission, pt reports feeling
exhausted and thus came to the ED. Pt was initially sent to
[**Location (un) 620**] where she was given another dose of Levaquin and stress
dose steroids. She was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED, she was
found to have an elevated lactate and she was started on the
sepsis protocol.
.
Her recent history is significant for asymptomatic bullae on her
B LE and itch papules on her B UE for the past two months.  She
saw a dermatologist who presumptively diagnosed bullous
pemphigoid and started her on a prednisone taper (started
[**10-18**]).  She felt her lesions improved somewhat with the
prednisone but have not resolved completely.
On arrival to the ICU, she denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, headache, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria,
fevers or chills. She has some back pain and pain in her lower
legs. She states she is no longer ambulatory due to lower ext
pain.

After a night in the ICU she was felt stable for transfer to the
floor.  On questioning she states she feels tired but somewhat
better.  She denies any pain, dyspnea, nausea, or diarrhea.


Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes Type II.
2. MS, 3 prior episodes of transverse myelitis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Diabetic sensory motor neuropathy.
5. Depression and anxiety.
6. frequent UTIs - up to 2x/month, usually treated with
levofloxacin
7. Hypothyroidism
8. Recent diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.

Social History:
She currently lives alone with a home health aide who visits
with her five days a week.  She has two daughters who live close
by her and are involved in her care.  They also serve as her

Reports:
[**11-10**] ABD/PELVIC CT:
1.  Hypodense areas posteriorly in the upper and mid poles of
the right
kidney. It is unclear whether this is secondary to artifact or
could represent an area of focal pyelonephritis.  There is no
evidence of renal abscess. There is no evidence of
intraabdominal abscess.
2.  Atelectatic changes of the lungs.

[**11-6**] ABD/PELVIC CT:
1.  Likely cystitis.
2.  Hypodense subcentimeter cortical lesions in the left kidney
too small to be characterized.  There is no hydronephrosis.
Normal excretion is seen from both kidneys.

[**11-10**] HEAD CT:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or enhancing lesions.
2.  Multiple extra-axial calcified nodules most likely
representing calcified meningiomas.

[**11-10**] EEG:
This EEG is consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of toxic,
metabolic, or anoxic etiology. No evidence of ongoing or
potential seizures is seen at this time.

Pathology:
LE skin biopsy:
1. Subepidermal bulla formation with associated papillary dermal
lymphohistiocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate and abundant
interstitial eosinophils, consistent with bullous pemphigoid,
see note.
Note:  Direct immunofluorescence studies show linear deposition
of IgG (2+) and C3 (2+) at the dermal/epidermal junction.
Staining for fibrinogen (3+) is present within the blister
cavity (non-specific).  Direct immunofluorescence studies for
IgA, IgM, and phosphate-buffered saline (negative control) are
negative.  Immunostain for collagen type IV highlights the base
of the bulla.
The overall findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous
pemphigoid; clinical correlation is suggested to exclude a
drug-related etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with a history of Multiple
sclerosis, DM, HTN, and frequent UTIs due to a chronic
indwelling Foley catheter who presented with a presumed
urosepsis.
.
1. Urosepsis:
She has a history of chronic UTIs, up to twice per month that
are thought to be due to her indwelling Foley catheter.  She has
had a foley catheter for several years and has it changed once
per month by her home health aide.  On admission she had stable
hemodynamics but had an elevated lactate and was admitted to the
ICU under the sepsis protocol.  Her hemodynamics remained stable
and her lactate trended down and she was quickly transferred to
the medical floor.  Her urine culture eventually grew positive
for a highly resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia. In
consultation with the ID service, she was treated with
ceftriaxone for six days and meropenem for four days.  In
addition, abdominal CT scans were performed which did not reveal
any anatomic abnormality in the urinary tract or any evidence of
pyelonephritis (the suspicion of pyelonephritis seen on the [**11-10**]
study was thought to be due to artifact).  She thus completed a
10 day course of IV antibiotics and was not discharged on any
antibiotic prophylaxis as she has a history of highly resistant
organisms.  She should have her Foley catheter changed weekly
under sterile conditions to try to prevent future urinary tract
infections.
.
2. Delirium:
In the middle of her hospitalization she was noted to become
agitated and delirious alternating between becoming quite
somnolent and delirious with confusion, agitation, and
perseveration.  She was so delirious that she required
intubation to perform CT scans.  Evaluation of this included a
negative EEG, a negative head CT, a negative CXR, an abdominal
CT negative for an intra-abdominal infection, and normal labs
(CBC and electrolytes).  In addition repeat urine and blood
cultures were negative.  All of her psychotropic medications
were held including ativan and any sleeping agents such as
ambien or trazodone and she was weaned off of her paxil.
Eventually her mental status cleared and she was again alert and
oriented, conversant, and able to follow directions.  Thus it
was thought that her delirium was most likely medication
induced.  At discharge, she was maintained on her multiple
sclerosis meds but was not on paxil or ativan.
.
3. Diabetes mellitus:
She was maintained on her home regimen of 75/25 and glyburide.
Her metformin was held initially due to an elevated creatinine
and was not restarted during her hospitalization.  Her blood
sugars ranged during her stay depending on her po intake but
over the several days preceding her discharge her blood sugars
were around 100.  She was discharged on the following regimen.
75/25 18 units with breakfast and 20 units with dinner and
glyburide 5 mg twice daily.  This regimen may need to be altered
depending on her po intake.  She is also completing a prednisone
taper (finished [**2119-11-13**]) which may cause her blood sugars to
decrease somewhat.

4. Bullous pemphigoid:
She was seen by the dermatology service while hospitalized and a
punch biopsy was consistent with bullous pemphigoid.  She was
continued on her prednisone taper (finished [**2119-11-13**]) and was
also given topical clobetasol 0.05% cream twice daily.  On this
regimen her blisters and erosions over her bilateral knees
slowly began to resolve.  They did not disappear completely and
if there is further concern, her outside dermatologist should be
contact[**Name (NI) **] (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 98283**] of [**Hospital1 **] [**Name (NI) 47**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 98284**]).

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 66 yo M with long standing secondary
progressive multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, multiple UTIs in the
setting of choronic indwelling suprapubic catheter presents from
[**Location (un) 86**] Home with lethargy and anuria for a day.
.
Per the [**Location (un) 86**] Home nursing staff, the patient is not alert and
oriented at baseline, and after lunch yesterday suddenly became
lethargic and unresponsive. The nursing staff denies any chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting at the time. Vital
signs taken at the time revealed no fever and were otherwise
stable. The patient was then sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
Of note, the patient has had very poor oral intake (both solid
and liquid) due to a flare of his [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 99497**]. He also
did reportedly have some dental work done recently, although the
precise nature of this dental work could not be clarified.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 99.4, HR 101, BP 124/74,
RR 16, O2Sat 92% RA. The patient received vancomycin, cefepime
for empiric antibiotic coverage. The patient was then noted to
be persistently hypotension to the 70s systolic and was
initially on peripheral norepinephrine after failed attempts
were made at placing right IJ and subclavian CVL. He then
received 5L NS, although reportedly he remained anuric
throughout his ED course. His physical exam was notable for a
distended abdomen without tenderness. Labs pertinent for
elevated WBC to 19 and elevated Cr to 1.6. Initial UA
significant for large leuks (130 WBC, 200 RBC, many bacteria).
CXR demonstrated stable appearance of L basilar consolidation
and effusion (stable compared to previous CXRs going back to
[**2171**]).  Patient had two PIVs in place and was taken off levophed
prior to transfer to the ICU.  Vitals prior to transfer to the
MICU were: T 99.2, HR 88, BP 141/94, O2Sat 99% 2L NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with history of MS, suprapubic catheter
w/recurrent UTIs presenting with lethagy and anuria.  On
admission, the patient had a leukocytosis to 19, tachycardia,
hypotension and he was admitted to the MICU.  He was started on
IV linezolid/meropenem.  He was seen by urology who relieved a
SPT obstruction after which he had good urine output.  His
condition improved with IV fluids and antibiotics and he was
transferred to the floor. On the floor, he remained afebrile
without leukocytosis.  A blood culture from [**1-30**] (1 of 2) was
positive for coag negative staph which was felt to be a
contamination. His urine culture was also contaminated and
therefore not speciated.  Subsequent urine cultures were
negative.  He will be discharged on a total 14 day course of
antibiotics (PO linezolid and IV ertapenem) for presumed
urosepsis.  Other issues during his admission includes anemia
with iron studies suggesting anemia of chronic disease.  He also
presented with acute kidney injury which resolved with IVF.  His
electrolytes were repleted prn and was notable for low phos
which returned to [**Location 213**] with IV repletion.  A PTH was chacked
to look for primary or secondary hyperparathyroid, but this was
pending prior to discharge.  We would recommend follow-up of his
phos by his PCP in addition to checking vitamin D levels.  He
also did have some loose stools and C diff was negative.  His
bowel regimen was held during most of his hospitalization.  In
regards to MS and his other chronic medical issues, his home
medications were continued.  As a side note, pleural effusions
and LLL consolidation were noted on CXR and were determined to
be stable compared to prior films.  These findings have been
present since at least [**2171**] and per his PCP are likely secondary
to chronic atelectasis.

In brief, this is a 66 yo M with multiple sclerosis, [**Month/Day/Year 78605**],
suprapubic catheter, and multiple UTIs admitted 3/7-311 with
lethargy and anuria. He was febrile in the ED and was given
vanc/cefepime/levo and IVF for hypotension. He appeared septic
and was admitted to the MICU. In the MICU, he did not need
pressors and was treated with linezolid and meropenem to cover
most likely urinary pathogens given a history of VRE and
pseudomonas. He was discharge earlier in the day on Linezolid
and ertapnem. Blood cx subsequently returned positive for GPCs
in clusters so he was directly readmitted back to CC7. per
attending discussion with ID, vancomycin was recommended rather
than linezolid for coverage.

(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-8-22**],
there is no significant change.

66 year old male with history of MS, suprapubic catheter
presents for admission after being found to have a positive
blood culture after being discharged from hospitalization for
sepsis of unidentified source.
.
During his first hospital course, no organism had been
identified and the patient appeared clinically well with no
fevers or white count.  He was originally discharged on
linezolid and meropenem for broad empiric coverage given history
of resistant bugs in the past. He had had one set blood cx
positive for coag-negative GPC which was presmued to be a
contaminant. However, when a second BCx (from [**2-2**]) returned
positive with a similar profile shortly after discharge, he was
readmitted for further work-up. ID was consulted, and they
recommended changing his antibiotic course to vancomycin and
meropenem. He continued to appear clinically well with no fevers
or leukocytosis and surveillance blood cultures were negative.
He underwent a TTE to r/o endocarditis but the image quality was
poor.  A TEE was attempted but the patient did not tolerate the
procedure.  ID recommended continuing vancomycin until [**2-18**] and
completing the course of carbapenem through [**2-13**].  They will
follow him and weekly labwork in [**Hospital 4898**] clinic.
.
In regards to access, his L PICC was found to be partially
thrombosed and was removed.  The IV team was unable to obtain
peripheral access and unable to obtain a PICC in the Right arm.
IR was able to place a PICC in the right arm. He will follow-up
in [**Hospital 4898**] clinic.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 49 year old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis
and recurrent UTI's with [**Month/Year (2) 45862**] catheter who presented with
fever and mental status change.  Patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.  Short [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for sepsis protocol
involved rescucitation with IVF, no pressors and initiation of
Zosyn/Vancomycin.  The following issues were addressed on this
admission:
.
1) Concerning Fevers, Mental Status Change: Patient admitted
with fevers to 102 and history of urinary tract infections
([**Hospital Unit Name 45862**] catheter) from multi-drug resistant organisms
including psuedomonas and MRSA. Likely sources of infection
included urine and or foot ulcers given history and exam.  As
per ICU team, although patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia,
and hyperthermia, she was never hypotensive and lactate was <4.
History of multiple prior UTI's however, did not notice her
usual symptoms, no purulent drainage form [**Hospital Unit Name 45862**] tube which
was due to be changed but urine grew both pseudomonas and MRSA.
The patient also reported recent history of trauma to foot
ulcers, swabs growing lots of bacteria but are of unclear value.
 Reportedly with purulent drainage, fluctuance induration at
home, but on exam here, no evidence of osteomyletis.  Foot films
were negative for evidence of bone infection.  Patient had
ultrasound for suspicious looking area of fluctuance of fifth
left toe.  Ultrasound showed no evidence of abcess. Exam
consistent with possible cellulitis.  There were no other
localizing sources of infection on history/exam.   No evidence
pneumonia, abdominal or other source at this time. No evidence
of meningismus to suggest meningitis/encephalitis.  Chest x-ray
was without acute process.  Blood cultures remained negative as
of date of discharge.
Patient maintained on zosyn/vancomycin.  She will be treated
with 14 day course of each to cover urinary tract infection
secondary to pseudomonas and MRSA and possible cellulitis.
Final blood culture results pending at time of discharge.
Altered mental status returned to baseline over [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course with
treatment of infection and IV fluids.

2)Concerning multiple sclerosis: Patient was maintained on
baclofen, gabapentin, glatiramer; prednisone (got stress dose in
ER given relative hypotension). [**Name2 (NI) **] acute issues. On alendronate
given long-term steroids, dosing q Thursday.
*
3) Prophylaxis: Patient maintained on subcutaneous heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and  famotidine (given steroids) for GI
prophylaxis.

4) Pain: Percocet was maintained on her home dosing for foot
pain.
*
5) Code: Patient full code throughout admission.

Patient was a candidate for rehabilitation but did not desire
rehab at this time, wanted to be discharged to home.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50F with hx of MS, chronic UTIs who presents with lethargy
and fever presumably [**3-6**] to a recurrent UTI. Was also intubated
following an episode of ""agonal"" breathing, possibly related to
anaphylactic reaction to ceftriaxone.

1. Fever/UTI: Pt with grossly positive UA and with hx of several
UTIs including pseudomonas, MRSA, Klebsiella.  No pneumonia seen
on CXR.  Heel ulcers do not appear infected.  LP/CSF negative
for meningitis.  Patient was treated broadly for her UTI with
14d of vancomycin and meropenem.  Her urine culture never grew
an organism except for 10-100k yeast, which was not treated.
Blood cultures were negative.  She remained afebrile and without
leukocytosis. A bladder scan was repeated to look for a stone
which could be causing her frequent UTIs, however, this was
negative.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] for management
of her [**Last Name (STitle) 45862**] cath and whether to resume tobramycin
irrigation.

2. Microcytic anemia
Patient was noted to have guaiac positive stools but her HCT
remained stable at 30. She should have an out-pt colonoscopy.

3. Respiratory failure
She was intubated [**3-6**] agonal breathing and extubated [**8-17**]
without incident. She occasionally reports some sob but does not
appear to be in any distress, no increased work of breathing.
Encourage IS use.

4. Allergic reaction
Had respiratory distress and rash, which appears to be related
to ceftriaxone, however, pt received ceftaz in recent past
without incident(completed course [**8-1**]).

5. Tachycardia/Bigeminy:
Pt admitted with HR in the 160s which came down to 110s with
fluid; cardiac enzymes negative, no events on tele. resolved

6. MS:
Patient's weakness was worse than baseline [**3-6**] recent illness.
She was seen by PT/OT who recommended rehab, which she refused.
She was continued on her out-patient dose of baclofen and
neurontin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 74 yoM w/ a h/o MS, PE, and syncope
presents with hypotension and found to have UTI.

1. Hypotension/UTI:  Likely due to urosepsis. The patient's
blood pressure responded nicely to IV fluids in the ICU.  His
chronic bradycardia probably contributed to the overall picture
and inability to compensate.  His antihypertensives were
initially held and he was restarted on amlodipine and enalapril
prior to discharge.  He was treated with meropenem (given his
history of ESBL Klebsiella) for his UTI which was changed to
ertapenem at the time of discharge.  His suprapubic catheter was
changed.

2. Non responsiveness: He has a long history of vasovagal
syncope and has had multiple outpatient studies to work this up.
 This episode was unlikely a syncopal event given the duration
that he was non responsive. He had no witnessed seizure
activity.  This episode was more likely due to global cerebral
hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension / UTI.  We discussed
at length that his family should bring him immediately to the ED
if he has an event like this in the future.  Pt to have
outpatient cognitive screening.

3. Bradycardia: Was seen by EP last year for recurrent syncopal
episodes, hypertension, and prolonged PR interval his syncope
was determined to be likely vasovagal given his prodrome of
diaphoresis, fatigue, and nausea.

4. Multiple sclerosis:  continued his home baclofen, enablex,
neurontin, methylphenidate, and remeron.  Has chronic
constipation and was continued on his bowel regimen.

5. Hypercholesterolemia: His statin was held due to an increased
Ck which trended down during his admission.  He should discuss
with his PCP whether to restart his statin.

6. Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia and responded
to hydration.

7. Renal failure: Cr 1.3 at admission and normalized during his
admission.

8. Ppx: heparin sc tid, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker.

Images:
[**2153-8-9**]
- CXR Portable: Limited study not including the left
costophrenic angle and low lung volumes.  Cardiac silhouette is
mildly enlarged, unchanged from [**2152-4-27**]. The aorta is tortuous
with calcification at the knob. The hilar contours are overall
stable. There is no focal consolidation in the lungs. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. Partially visualized
upper abdomen demonstrates air-filled dilated loops of bowel,
which is similar in appearance from [**2152-4-27**]. Surgical clips are
seen in the midline. Degenerative changes at the right shoulder
are similar from [**2152-4-24**].
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

- CT head without contrast: There is no hemorrhage or evidence
of acute major vascular territorial infarction. Again noted is a
6-mm hyperdensity in the left parietal lobe, unchanged in size
and appearance from [**2150-12-19**] and likely represents a cavernoma.
A 6 mm rounded hyperdensity at the midline along the roof of the
third ventricle is similar in size and appearance from
[**2150-12-19**] and likely represents a colloid cyst. The lateral
ventricles are stable in size. The ventricles and sulci are
stably prominent in size and configuration, compatible with
age-related global atrophy. Periventricular white matter
hypodensities are likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. Stable small areas of encephalomalacia involving the
left cerebellum, right parietal and bifrontal lobes. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No bony
abnormalities are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Stable 6 mm rounded hyperdensity at the roof of the third
ventricle likely represents a colloid cyst. Lateral ventricles
are stable in size from [**2150-12-19**].
3. Hyperdense focus in the left parietal lobe is stable and
likely represents a cavernoma, as characterized on prior MRI.

[**2153-8-11**]
- CTA head and neck (prelim): Colloid cyst and left parietal
probable cavernoma are unchanged since [**2153-8-9**]. No evidence
of acute intracranial process. CTA demonstrates patent COW
vessels. Possible fetal origin of L PCA. Patent vertebral
arteries and ICAs, with atherosclerotic disease. Recons pending.
Reported to Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 6:40pm by phone on [**2153-8-11**]

- 24 hour EEG- Began at 20:30 on the evening of [**8-11**].
It showed a widespread low voltage faster background that
appeared normal for wakefulness. The background included some
low voltage admixed alpha frequencies of 10 Hz or so. The
recording showed no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there
were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed no clear epileptiform
discharges.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed plentiful lead and other
artifact but no electrographic seizures.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep at
appropriate times, and sleep patterns appeared normal and
symmetric.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry showed a normal background in
wakefulness and in sleep. There were no areas of prominent focal
slowing. There were no epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures captured on continuous EEG or by automated detection
programs.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with MS, h/o sinus bradycardia and dx of
vasovagal syncope who prsents with two days of unresponsiveness.

.
#. Altered mental status.  Patient was transferred to the MICU
with another episode of unresponsiveness in the setting of
bradycardia (30s bpm) and hypotension (SBP 70s).  EKG showed
only sinus bradycardia.  He was volume resucitated, started on
Meropenem for h/o ESBL UTI, and was about to be intubated due to
concern for inability ot protect his airway.  Suddenly he awoke
with clear consciousness and stated that he was having a vagal
episode.  Neurology was consulted about this ""vagal episode"".
High concern was given to the likelyhood of non convulsive
seizures.  After his arousal his hemodynamic status had improved
and he was called out to the floor.  He underwent a 24 hours EEG
while in the hospital, which showed no signs of seizure.  Some
of his medications were adjusted with the question about timolol
having systemic effect and discontinuation of gabapention.  The
most likely cause of his altered mental status is likely due to
autonomic dysfunction and hypoperfusion in the setting of
dehydration and UTI.  This however should be followed up by his
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cardiologist, and his
ophthalmologist.
.
#. Labile blood pressure: Hypotension & Hypertension.
Hypotension at the initial presentation is likely due to
hypovolemia given pre-renal state.  It improved with hydration.
However, given that he has MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**], likely has some
autonomic dysfuction, and post hydration, his SBP was elevated
up to the 180s.  In addition to the increase in lisinopril from
10 mg to 20 mg, he also received an additional dose of
hydralazine IV.  His BP improved from these measures, and he is
to go home on home medication given prior history of
hypotension.  This should be followed up by his primary care
doctor.
.
#. Urinary tract infection.  This was found in the UA on
admission as a part of the AMS work-up.  He was started on
meropenem [**2153-8-9**] initially given hsitory of ESBL UTI.  As the
culture grew out sensitive E. Coli, he was switched to Keflex
because of sensitivity to cefazolin on [**2153-8-11**].  The plan was
to complete a 10 day course of antibiotics on [**2153-8-17**].  This
can be followed up by his primary care provider.
.
#. Acute renal failure.  Patient initally presented elevated Crt
1.6 with [**Year (4 digits) 5348**] of 0.8-1.0.  He was fluid resuscitated in the
MICU, and his Crt returned to [**Year (4 digits) 5348**] on [**2153-8-10**].
.
#. Multiple sclerosis, non-acute issue.
.
#. Neurogenic bladder.  Patient received a new suprapubic
catheter on [**2153-8-10**].
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea.  Patient continued with home BIPAP.

heard him call that he was about to fall, and saw him
immediately afterward.  EMS noted him to be bradycardic in
field.

Head lac after he hit his right brow on wall; lac repaired in
ED.

He insists his heart rate is typically in 40s-50s; his
cardiologist has not suggested intervention.  He has not had a
fall in years despite MS, left leg [**Last Name (LF) 36579**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] use.  He
mentions his blood pressure is typically in the 130s but
routinely falls to 110s if he doesn't drink much during the day.
 No chest pain, lightheadedness, change in urine, cough,
dyspnea, fever, night sweats or chills.

He was recently admitted for an acute change in mental status
and bradycardia.

In the ED, HR dipped temporarily to 34, mostly around 50.  SBPs
were in 90s/100s.  He was afebrile w/O2 sat 100% on RA.  CT head
and c-spine were negative.  A U/A showed 30-50WBCs, moderate
bacteria and 0-2 epithelial cells.  He was feeling well and not

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24110**] is a 76 year old male with MS, h/o sinus bradycardia
and recent admission for vasovagal syncope who prsents s/p
mechanical fall, found to be hypotensive and bradycardic.

#. Hypotension/Hypertension - Pt with very labile blood
pressures ranging from SBP 90s-low 200s, likely [**12-19**] to autonomic
dysfunction. Pt admitted with SBP 90s, initially improved with
small bolus of IVF. Prior to discharge, the patient was noted to
be hypertensive (up to SBP 208). He was continued on his home
Enalapril at discharge, but this should be discussed at his
upcoming outpatient appointments with his cardiolgist and
gerontologist, as the episodes of hypotension may be
contributing to his instability and falls.

#Falls - Pt evaluated by PT who determined that from a
mechanical state, the pt is a high risk for falling again.  PT
arranged for home PT sessions.

# Bradycardia - Pt with sinus bradycardia, similar to recent
[**Month/Day (2) 5348**]. EKG with prolonged PR interval. TSH was WNL. Pt has
f/u with cardiology in 3 days.

# ARF: Likely pre-renal, as FENa was <1%. Cr improved with IVF.

# Head Lac - Was sutured in ED with absorbable sutures (no need
to remove), CT of head/Cspine showed no acute process (no
bleed). CT Cspine does note thyroid nodules, which should be
followed up with ultrasound if not previously worked up.
- needs thyroid ultrasound

# Multiple Sclerosis: Walks with a [**Month/Day (2) **] at [**Month/Day (2) 5348**]

# UTI: Likely colonized given chronic suprapubic catheter. No
fever, elevated WBC count, or elevated lactate. Pt received a
dose of Ceftriaxone in the ED, but further antibiotics were
held.
- f/u UCx

#OSA: Bipap while inpatient

#Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops

#Multiple sclerosis: Has been stable for many years.  Ambulates
w/[**Month/Day (2) **]. Evaluted by physical therapy - the patient is quite
unstable and at high risk for further falls. He is not agreeable
to going to rehab at this time.

#HLD: Continued home simvastatin

#Afib: Continued home [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 24110**],

You were admitted to the hospital after a fall. You had stitches
placed in your forehead for a laceration. These stitches will
resorb on their own and do not need to be removed. Your heart
rate and blood pressure were noted to be low, which improved
with intravenous fluids. You were also noted to have mild renal
failure, which also improved with intravenous fluids. Prior to
discharge, your blood pressure was noted to be quite high while
you were walking with physical therapy. You should continue on
your blood pressure [**Known lastname 4085**] as previously prescribed - but
please ask your doctors about this [**Name5 (PTitle) 4085**] during your
scheduled follow up appointments, as your blood pressure ranged
from systolics of 90s-200s.

No changes were made to your medications.

We recommend that you spend the next few days resting at home.
You just had a fall, and your heart rate and blood pressure were
quite low - concerning enough to be admitted to the intensive
care unit. You will likely improve faster if you stay home and
reduce your physical activity over the next 2-3 days. It will
also be very important for you to work with physical therapy at
home to improve your strength. You are at a very high risk of
falls, which can be very dangerous.

It was a pleasure meeting you and taking part in your care.

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin and [**Known lastname 4532**],
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previously diagnosed ""vasovagal
syncope,"" prostate cancer, neurogenic bladder with chronic
suprapubic cath, history of ESBL UTI, chronic constipation, and
left parietal AVM, presenting from home after a syncopal
episode.  Patient apparently woke up this morning feeling
extremely weak and tired.  Per his wife, he was also difficult
to arouse with multiple episodes of somnolence.  EMS was called
in the morning, but patient refused to be taken to the hospital
as he felt well by their arrival.  Patient was then eating a
bowl of fruit this afternoon, and his wife found him slumped in
a chair.  He regained conciousness several minutes later. EMS
was subsequently called again.  Patient has no recollection of
passing out, nor did he feel any prodrome of chest pain, nausea,
diaphoresis, SOB, dizziness.  On EMS arrival, HR 30s BP 70s, and
patient was asymptomatic.
.
On arrival to the ED, HR was in the 30s-40s, BPs labile
80s-120s.  Patient had no symptoms during low BPs. He was given
IV cipro for history of UTI, 2L NS and sent to the unit.  His
Hct was 26 and was guiac negative in the ED.  On transfer to the
unit, patient was afebrile HR 44, 114/49 18 100% on 2L NC.
.
Of note, patient had been admitted in [**Month (only) **] for a similar
episode of unresponsiveness with a negative workup, as well as
prior synopal workups in the past.  He reports that todays
episode was similar in nature in that he did not feel any
prodrome and did not remember passing out.  He also has had
several episodes of diagnosed ""vasovagal syncope,"" prior to
which he sometimes feels weak and nauseous. On review of prior
notes, patient is also chronically bradycardic with HRs in 40s
at [**Month (only) 5348**], with transient episodes of hypotension.  He has a
Holter monitor in our system from [**2141**], which showed no ectopy,
HRs 49-70, with prolonged PR intervals .24.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Of note, he had a EGD/colonoscopy on [**11-11**] for workup of
Fe deficiency anemia, which showed a non-bleeding adenoma.  He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. His last bowel movement was 1.5 weeks ago,
whichg he states is roughly his [**Month/Year (2) 5348**].  All of the other
review of systems were negative.

[**2149-5-15**] CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large skin defect
overlying the sacrum with overlying bandage material. The defect
measures up to 2 cm in maximum dimension and traverses the soft
tissue to the underlying bone. There is cortical disruption and
fragmentation of the mid portion of the coccyx bone adjacent to
the ulceration consistent with osteomyelitis. A small amount of
cutaneous adjacent gas is present. There is moderate thickening
and stranding in the regional soft tissues. No abscess
collection is identified.

Foley catheter is present within the urinary bladder. Air within
the bladder is likely iatrogenic. The imaged portions of the
intrapelvic bowel, uterus, rectum, and sigmoid colon appear
unremarkable. There are mild degenerative changes within the
lower lumbar spine. The hip joints are mildly narrowed but
symmetric. Sacroiliac joints and pubic symphysis are grossly
unremarkable. Multiple calcified injection granulomas are seen
within the gluteal soft tissues. There are small inguinal and
iliac chain lymph nodes which do not meet criteria for
pathologic enlargement.

IMPRESSION: Large sacral decubitus ulceration, cortical
disruption of the mid coccyx consistent with osteomyelitis.

Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG placement ([**2151-9-27**])
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 46 yo F with severe chronic multiple sclerosis, who is
admitted to the MICU for hypoxia. She was recently admitted to
[**Hospital3 2358**] for 5 days last week (discharged [**9-13**]) for
pneumonia on a 14 day course of oral levofloxacin.
She had been feeling well until this afternoon when she became
acutely short of breath. Her home nurse checked her O2 sat on
room air was 80% and she was brought to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS: 97 111/79 95 88% on RA which increased to
96% on 3L by nc. A NIF was -22. Her chest x-ray showed fullness
at hilum bilaterally (my read) but was otherwise unrevealing.
She was sent for a CTA to r/o PE and better evaluate her lung
parenchyma. The CT was negative for PE and showed bilateral PNA.
She received a dose of vancomycin and CTX (? cefepime). Blood cx
sent. When she returned from CT, she was more hypoxic - 88% on
5L nc and which normalized to 95% on a 50% venti mask. She was
transferred to the ICU for hypoxia.

On evaluation on the floor, patient reports her breathing is
comfortable. She denies any current SOB, CP, abd pain, back
pain, HA or vision change. She does endorse mild nausea which
she associates with the fact that she hasn't eaten.

III. Radiology

A. Speech and Swallow
STUDY TYPE: Video oropharyngeal swallow.

INDICATION: Progressive MS with likely aspiration pneumonia,
assess for
aspiration.

TECHNIQUE: Swallowing oropharyngeal video fluoroscopy was
performed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division. Multiple
consistencies of
barium were administered.

FINDINGS: Barium enters the oropharynx without obstruction.
There is a slow
oral phase with difficulty initiating passage of the bolus into
the oropharynx
and esophagus with high oral residual. There is aspiration of
both
honey-thickened and thick barium. The patient had difficulty
initiating cough
to clear this aspirated material. For full details, please see
the speech and
swallow division note in the online medical record.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration with honey-thickened and thick barium.

B. Renal US
INDICATION: History of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis,
recent
hospitalization with pneumonia and rule out fungus ball or upper
tract disease
in kidneys.

COMPARISON: [**2145-3-3**].

FINDINGS: The study is technically limited due to poor acoustic
window.
Within these limitations, there is no evidence of renal mass,
abscess,
perinephric collection, or hydronephrosis. The right kidney
measures 8.6 cm
and the left kidney measures 8.7 cm. The bladder is collapsed
with Foley
catheter in situ.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal abscess.
Overall,
unremarkable son[**Name (NI) **] within technical limitations stated above.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

C. CXR
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Severe MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 16169**] aspiration pneumonia.

Comparison is made with prior study [**9-20**].

Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Left PICC tip is in the
mid to lower
SVC. NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach. Right lower lobe
opacities have
improved consistent with improving atelectasis. Left perihilar
minimal
opacities are unchanged. This could be due to atelectasis or
aspiration.
There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or pleural
effusions.

D. PICC Placement
PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed for intravenous fluid bolus and
potential
intravenous antibiotics.

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14804**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**] performed the
procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
left brachial
vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a
micropuncture set.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and
immediately after
establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then
placed over a
guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 40 cm
in length was
then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned
in the SVC
under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was
confirmed by a
fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was
secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate
complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French
double-lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial venous
approach. Final
internal length is 40 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The
line is ready
to use.


E. CTA
NDICATION: Hypoxia.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical CT scan of the chest was
obtained before and
after the administration of IV Optiray contrast. Axial, coronal,
sagittal,
and oblique reformations were prepared.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph performed the same day.

FINDINGS: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified, and
there is no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The aorta is normal in caliber
and
configuration. No evidence of acute aortic syndrome is seen.
Remaining great
vessels are normal, and the heart is unremarkable.Several
enlarged lymph nodes
are seen, including prevascular, subcarinal and bilateral hilar
stations. At
the left hilum, there is borderline enlargement measuring up to
11 mm in short
axis. No pleural or pericardial effusion is present.

Bibasilar linear opacities are seen, right greater than left.
Additionally,
there is opacification extending along the bronchovascular
bundles, radiating
from the hila, with bronchial wall thickening bilaterally. Fluid
and
secretions are seen within the trachea and extending into the
lower airways
bilaterally. The airways however are not completely occluded.
Ill-defined
nodular opacities are also noted scattered in both upper lobes.
No
pneumothorax is seen.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. No
concerning osseous
lesion is seen.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe bronchial wall thickening and
opacification
along the bronchovascular bundles, with linear airspace
opacities. Findings
likely reflect bronchial inflammation or infection. Mediastinal
and hilar
lymphadenopathy is likely reactive.

IV. Cardiology
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave flattening.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2149-5-16**] the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no
diagnostic
interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
46-year-old female with severe multiple sclerosis admitted to
MICU with hypoxia secondary to aspiration pneumonitis with
subsequent PEG placement and discussion with husband about
hospice.

# Aspiration with hypoxic respiratory distress
Likely from aspiration event on top of prior pneumonia. Patient
initially hypoxic to the high 80's which improved on oxygen.
Intubation not required. Clinical history of acute onset
(~30min) more consistent with aspiration rather than worsening
of pneumonia.  CT findings suggesting aspiration pneumonitis.
Patient recently hospitalized for pneumonia at [**Hospital3 2358**].
Other possibilities include PE (ruled out on CT) or worsening of
her MS though the acuity makes this unlikely. She was initially
treated with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin. After
resolution of hypoxia, patient called out to floor and weaned
from O2 with no further issues. Antibiotic coverage was narrowed
to a 7-day course of levaquin/flagyl. Repeat CXR showed no
apparent infiltrate or worsening lung disease. Blood, sputum
cultures were negative. Remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. Given [**Hospital3 16169**] aspiration, multiple failed
speech/swallow evaluation, and difficulty managing secretions,
she was made NPO with dobhoff tube feeds. PEG tube was
subsequently placed after discussion with husband. [**Name (NI) **]
subsequently tolerated tube feeds well and was discharged.

# Chronic Severe Multiple Sclerosis: Patient is followed by
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Her MS medications were held or given at lower
dose given concern for altered sensorium and further aspiration
events. She was discharged on reduced dosage of gabapentin and
baclofen along with fluoxetine, oxycodone prn, tizanidine, and
ritalin.

Given end-stage MS, it was discussed with her husband about
hospice after Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested this possibility. Palliative
care consult discussed with husband for further outpatient
consideration.

# Anemia
Patient had admission Hct 42.7 with discharge Hct 32.8. Minimal
blood loss per IR from PEG placement. Stools were hemoccult
negative. Etiology unknown but Hct stable at discharge. DDx
includes phlebotomy, critical illness, or poor nutrition with
marrow suppressive effect.

Advise outpatient Hct check to see if continues to stabilize.

# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:
Patient has had long standing wound vac. Wound care consulted
for management and recommended pressure relief, frequent
repositioning. There were no signs of infection.

# Yeast on UA
Patient had UA with > 100,000 organisms/mL of yeast. Given
multiple sclerosis and likely functional bladder issues, concern
for colonization given foley vs. infection. Patient was afebrile
with no irritative symptoms. Renal US obtained to rule out upper
tract disease and was negative. Foley subsequently changed.

# Access
The patient lost access in the ICU with subsequent PICC placed
by IR for antibiotics. PICC line discontinued at discharge as no
further need for antibiotics.

# Code status: Full code, discuss further on outpatient basis.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 95322**],

You were treated for a possible lung infection that we believe
was related to aspirating. You had a speech and swallow study
that confirmed you are aspirating. Our speech and swallow team
feel that it is not safe for you to eat either liquids or solids
given your aspiration. However, you and your husband would like
for you to continue eating pureed food for comfort despite the
risk of more aspiration events and possibly [**Last Name (STitle) 16169**] lung
infections. You had a gastric feeding tube placed in order to
provide constant nutrition and a constant means of getting you
your medications. This tube does not prevent you from aspirating
saliva though.
.
Medication changes:
START ascorbic acid for nutrition
START bisacodyl for constipation
START lansoprazole for stomach acid reduction
START sarna lotion which is an over the counter cream for itch
relief
CHANGE baclofen 60 mg by mouth three times daily TO 40 mg by
mouth three times daily
CHANGE gabapentin 600 mg by mouth four times daily to 250 mg by
mouth four times daily
CHANGE percocet 10/325 mg TO oxycodone 5 mg by mouth every 4

altered mental status.  Per the husband, patient started
complaining of sore throat on Saturday.  Husband was concerned
she may be developing a cold given he had a recent cold, tried
to suction her at home because she sounded gurgling and also
felt that she was making choking noises.  No cough at home but
per husband she is unable to cough.  Also noticed that mental
status was worsening; at baseline she is conversational with her
husband and has a good memory, however over the last couple of
days she has been sleeping more slowly and has more difficulty
expressing hesrelf but has not been confused.  Husband was
concerned for aspiration (which she has had several times before
with aspiration PNA) so brought her to hospital.  Of note
patient was recently diagnosed with UTI by her PCP and started [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
10 day ciprofloxacin course on Saturday [**2-3**] which has not been
completed.  Also son has been concerned about worsening lesions
on patient's back; he notes bilateral lesions on scapulae with
the appearance of pressure ulcers, initially were red but notes
that the one on the right has become painful and has started to
open to an ulcer.  At baseline she gets nutrition from tube
feeds but occasionally will take small tastes of food PO, maybe
3-4 times per week, noted that she aspirates when this happens
.
In the ED initial VS were 101.3 97 123/77 18 87% on room air.
CXR was c/w prior with no acute process, put on NRB and sats
improved to 100%, she was eventually titrated down to 50% venti
mask and saturating 96-97% (not on oxygen at home).  She was
started on treatment with clindamycin and levofloxacin
(clindamycin was given for possible MRSA PNA although pt has no
hx of this and swab has been negative in the past).  Low BP
noted in ED (although unclear what BPs were), improved with IVF
and pt appeared more comfortable.  She was sent to ICU for
initial concern for hypotesnsion and respiratory status on
presentation.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt appears comfortable and states that
she feels better, denies any complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given her severe and debilitating neuromuscular disease, and her
history of [**Month/Day/Year 16169**] aspiration and prior admissions for
pneumonia, there was concern for acute on chronic aspiration
pneumonitis vs. pneumonia this admission, for which she was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibitoics. Given
worsening secretion burden and poor oxygenation, she required
intubation for bronchoalveolar lavage and to decrease her work
of breathing. After a lengthy discussion with her family, the
decision was made to attempt extubation following antibiotic
treatment and bronchoscopy, with no plans for future
intubations. She was extubated on [**2153-2-7**] and given her poor
performance and clinical status, she was transitioned to comfort
measures only with a continuous Moprhine infusion. The patient
expired on [**2153-2-17**]

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 70yo male w/hx of Multiple Sclerosis and chronic indwelling
foley who was brought to ED via EMS after having a witnessed
syncopal event on [**2-26**]. While eating dinner, he lost
conciousness and his head fell back and his arms went up. He was
noted by his wife and son to be gurgling. His family denies any
prodromal complaints aside from fatigue a few days prior. The
EMS team found him to be unresponsive with some emesis in his
mouth. Pt brought to ED, intubated for airway protection.
Received Vanco/Cefepime/Clinda initially and an additional
2Liters of NS. MICU course notable for hypotension unresponsive
to IVF requiring intermittient Levophed gtt.
Additionally a CT head postive for L post/temp intraparenchymal
bleed which was then re-read as an AVM. CT Angiogram of the
Chest was performed and revealed a R subsegmental non-occlusive
thrombi with a chronic appearance. While in the MICU the pt
failed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test, developed aspiration pneumonia, had
labile blood pressures requiring Nitroprusside gtt, and [**11-21**]
positive bld cx for Staph Epi. Pt ruled out for MI, Echo was

Brief Hospital Course:
70yo male with hx of Multiple Sclerosis and chronic indwelling
foley catheter a/w syncope, aspiration pneumonia, and possible
intraparenchymal CNS bleed.
1. Hypotension/Syncope: Hypotension resolved while in MICU. [**Month (only) 116**]
have been related to septic physiology on presentation. CTA with
non-occlusive segmental thrombi in R pulm art. which was thought
to be chronic and not related to primary event. Echo w/ nml EF
and wall motion, and valves, CT head with AVM stable on repeat
imaging and confirmed by MRI/MRA, EEG w/o epileptiform activity.
Pt has h/o vaso-vagal symptoms and was eating at the time of the
event which is the most likely cause. 1st degree AV block with
Wenckebach intermittently would not be a cause of syncope since
his heart rate was always normal. Neurosurgery consultation
recommended anticoagulation with Hep gtt while in house given
the PE and pt is immobile, but no long term anticoagulation is
recommended (pt is a fall risk, risk of CNS bleed, and PE is an
incidental finding)Bilateral LENIS were negative. We
specifically discussed with the patient about all the risks and
benefits of being anticoagulated and also not being
anticoagulated.  He understood everything and agreed with the
plan.  His outpt neurologist at [**Hospital1 2025**] was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and is
aware of his hospitalization.

2. ARF: Likely due to hypotension/ATN vs UTI. Normalized with
fluids.

3. ID: Bilateral aspiration PNA, + MRSA, and possible
bacteremia. Intubated for two days. Blood cultures only [**11-21**] grew
Coag neg staph, thought to be a contaminant. MRSA grew in
sputum. Total body macular rash developed while pt was on Zosyn
and Ceftriaxone.
-initially covered w/Vanco/Zosyn Dced upon transfer to floor.
Was on Clinda for two days but spiked through it to 103. Started
Flagyl/Aztreonam/Vanc [**3-1**] given allergy to quinolone and ? rash
to cephalosporins.
-DC A-line and DC Central Line [**2-28**], sent tip for culture.
-Surveillance cultures were all negative. Repeat CXR with slight
improvement.
-Pt has chronic indwelling foley but U/A has been negative.

4. Neuro: Multiple Sclerosis, and h/o CNS AVM. Pt seen by
neurology and neurosurgery early in hospital course. Pt was
deconditioned, weak, and fatigued for most of his stay with
limited mobility. Will need aggressive PT and cont treatment for
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] been on Cytoxan in the past and is followed by [**Hospital1 2025**]

IMAGING:

[**5-9**] CT abd/pelvis with contrast:
1. Bibasilar opacities including partial right middle lobe
collapse and
small-to-moderate bilateral effusions concerning for pneumonia.
2. Foley balloon inflated in the prostate.
3. Several indeterminate renal cysts, for which ultrasound
should be
performed to better evaluate. ***
4. Inflammatory stranding in the right colon with possible wall
thickening
may reflect mild, resolving colitis. Sigmoid diverticulosis
without
diverticulitis.
5. Status post gastric bypass without obstruction.
6. No subcutaneous air.

[**5-10**] Scrotal ultrasound:
Heterogeneous appearance to bilateral testicles, which are of
normal size. Arterial waveforms could be identified; however,
venous waveforms could not be identified. Torsion in a patient
of this age would be very unusual and the presence of arterial
flow essential excludes torsion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M s/p trach/peg who presents from LTAC with fever, cough,
and abdominal pain.

1. Respiratory Failure: Fever, leukocytosis, and CXR findings
supportive of a multifocal, vent-associated pneumonia; also with
right middle lobe collapse, bilateral effusions, and worsening
pulmonary edema. He was maintained on CPAP and started on
vancomycin and cefepime. Patient still with fevers to 102 prior
to discharge so started on standing Tylenol tid, but WBC slowly
improving on discharge. His lasix was initially held but
restarted at home dose of 20 mg IV bid on discharge.
* Plan for 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime; last dose on
[**5-17**].
* Check vancomycin trough at 7pm on [**5-11**] and as needed
thereafter
* Follow up pending sputum (gram neg rods on stain), blood, and
urine cultures
* Adjust lasix dose as indicated

2. Colitis: Pt with a history of C. diff. He was empirically
started on flagyl and po vancomycin on [**5-9**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
Here, he was initially continued on po vancomycin. However, CT
abdomen showed mild resolving colitis, and C. diff toxins
returned negative, so po vancomycin was stopped on day of
discharge.

3. Scrotal swelling/tenderness: Scrotal ultrasound unremarkable
with absent venous waveform but normal arterial inflow. Urology
consult felt this was not consistent with testicular torsion and
highly unlikely given age and bilateral presentation. [**Month (only) 116**]
represent a mild orchitis; scrotal elevation and
anti-inflammatories recommended. Potential infection would be
treated with his current antibiotic regimen for pneumonia.

4. Positive troponin: Mildly elevated on presentation but
patient without chest pain. Repeat troponin was flat, ruling out
MI. This likely represented mild demand in the setting of
infection. He was continued on his ASA and beta blocker.

5. Hypertension: Continued on outpatient amlodipine, metoprolol,
and lisinopril. Lasix restarted prior to discharge. Hydralazine
was discontinued.

6. Anemia: Hct remained stable in 27 to 30 range.

7. Depression: Continued citalopram.

8. Gout: Continued allopurinol.

9. Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine.

10. H/o GI Bleed: Continued sucralfate and omeprazole.

11. Incidental finding: CT Abd/pelvis showed ""several
indeterminate renal cysts.""
* Ultrasound recommended for better evaluation.

12. Code status: Pt confirmed full code with alternate HCP (son)
present.

Chief Complaint:
fevers and tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ placement [**2145-6-26**]

History of Present Illness:
62 yo female with pmhx sig for multiple sclerosis, hypertension,
seizures, and frequent UTIs, who presents to ED via ambulance
with fever to 105 and tachycardia. Pt is somewhat of a poor
historian as she is post-op on arrival to the ICU, but is able
to state that she called the ambulance after she began feeling
""so hot"". She denies any recent cough, dysuria, diarrhea, no
sick contacts, no recent travel; last hospitalization
approximately one month ago for MS exacerbation.
.
On arrival to the ED, she was tachycardic to the 140's, and
febrile to 105. Chest x-ray and UA were unremarkable, blood
cultures were drawn, lactate found to be 3.5. The patient had a
left SC port-a-cath that had been placed in [**2139**] for better
access for IV steroid requirements during her MS flares. This
was thought to be the likely source of infection, and surgery
was consulted. It was decided to take her to the OR for removal
of the catheter. Clear fluid drained from the cath, no frank pus
noted. Cultures of the fluid were sent and the cath tip sent for
culture. She was given a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin
along with 3 liters IVF in the ED, and admitted to the MICU for
further management. A code sepsis was not called, as the patient
never became hypotensive.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is alert and oriented x 3,
complaining of muscle spasms (chronic) in her legs. She denies
any other pain, no dyspnea. All other ROS negative.


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 yo female with history of MS, seizures, htn, urinary
infections who is admitted to ICU for fever and tachycardia.
.
# Fever/tachycardia- Pt qualified for SIRS.  Source was thought
to be most likely [**2-19**] to port-a-cath.  The port was removed by
surgery on the day of admission.  Hypotension resolved with
fluid boluses, and pt did not require any pressors.  Cultures
grew pansensitive pseudomonas. Pt was initially started on
Vancomycin and Levo changed to Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime
after culture data returned; Pt was afebrile for 72 hours before
discharge. She was hemodynamically stable throughout her stay on
the regular medical floor. A PICC line was placed for long term
antibiotic treatment(2 week course), pt was discharged with VNA
for IV services.
.
# Hypercalcemia- likely secondary to known hyperparathyroidism,
followed by endocrinology outpatient. Resolved with IVF and
continued on vitamin D; phosphate was repleted. Stable during
this admission.
.
# Anemia- stable at baseline hct 30-40.
.
# Elevated CK- in the setting of infection and rigors, pt also
reports fall at home three days ago. EKG shows non-specific ST
depressions, likely rate related, repeat cardiac enzymes were
negative
.
# Hypertension- possibly secondary to pain - initially held hctz
and lopressor in setting of infection; restarted after
port-a-cath removal and 24 hours stability on regular medical
floor.
.
# Seizure disorder- Pt no longer takes depakote. No sz activity
during this admission.
.
# MS- stable during this admission.

CXR [**3-4**]: Right lower lobe consolidation compatible with
infection in the
proper clinical setting. Recommend repeat after treatment to
document
resolution of this finding and of nodular opacity in the right
mid lung.
.
Renal U/S [**3-5**]: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm and the left
kidney measures 11.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis seen
bilaterally. No cyst or stone or solid mass is seen in either
kidney. The bladder is collapsed on a Foley catheter.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound. No hydronephrosis
identified
.
CT chest [**2199-3-6**]
1. Loculated moderate right pleural effusion. Adjacent
consolidation most
likely reflecting rounded atelectasis.
2. Nodular opacity seen on the radiograph most likely represents
summation of shadows or atelectasis adjacent to the major
fissure, 4:108.
3. A loculated pleural effusion and rounded atelectasis are of
uncertain
chronicity.
4. Right upper lobe 3.5-mm nodule that in the presence of severe
emphysema should be reevaluated in one year for documentation of
stability. Given the presence of multiple mediastinal lymph
nodes, a short-term followup is recommended such as three to six
months.
5. Calcified gallstones with no evidence of cholecystitis.
6. Lunate shape of the trachea that might reflect
tracheomalacia, if
clinically indicated, correlation with dedicated assessment of
the trachea is
recommended.
.
TTE [**2199-3-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No left ventricular thrombus seen. Mild symmetric
LVH with normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation
.
Chest CT [**3-8**]: 1. Interval placement of a right pleural catheter
with decrease in size of the right pleural effusion and
persistent but decreased adjacent atelectasis.
2. Hypodensity of the contents of the left ventricle with
possible discrete area of thrombus, although this most likely
represents artifact. Although suspicion is low, further
evaluation is recommended with echocardiogram
.
Chest CT [**3-10**]: 1. No significant change in the right
hydropneumothorax with drainage catheter in situ. 2. Stable
parenchymal changes in the subpleural right lower lobe which
could reflect pneumonic consolidation, rounded atelectasis, or a
combination of the two.

   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2199-3-11**]):
      STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS (MILLERI) GROUP.    SPARSE GROWTH.


Urine culture was done at an OSH, had multi-drug resistant
proteus


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, recent PNA,
recurrent UTI, who presents with fever, urinary tract infection
and acute renal failure, later found to have strep milleri
empyema.
.
# Urinary tract infection, w/ urosepsis: initially presented
febrile and hypotensive to 80's. He was initially in the MICU,
but responded very well to IVF, so was called out after 24
hours. He grew resistant proteus, and was started on meropenem.
He was initially to complete a 2 week course, but then empyema
was found so course of meropenem extended to 28 days minimum. A
PICC line was inserted on [**3-8**]. While on meropenem, should check
weekly CBC with dif, BUN, Creatinine, and LFTs
.
# Empyema: Likely related to PNA [**1-4**] prior to admission at [**Hospital1 2025**].
A thoracentesis was done, with chest tube left in place. Fluid
was grossly purulent, consistent with empyema. The empyema
eventually grew strep milleri. After 48 hours after admission.
he was afebrile and breathing well for rest of admission. CT
scan on [**3-10**] suggested trapped lung. Thoracic surgery consulted
and felt that decortication was not warranted, recommended that
the chest tube stay in place for at least 3 weeks, w/ thoracic
surgery follow-up at that time. TPA/DNase x2 was used to get out
residual empyema. Will continue extended course of meropenem as
well. At rehab, chest tube should be flushed w/ 20cc normal
saline 2-3 times daily. It should be to bulb suction or water
seal. He should have a repeat chest CT scan w/ IV contrast in 3
weeks
.
# Acute kidney injury: Admission creatinine was 5.1, from a
normal baseline. Likely was ATN from diarrhea/dehydration, and
pt also has ibuprofen 800mg TID listed on home meds. Was given
IVF, diarrhea resolved, and NSAIDs were held. His creatinine
returned to baseline of 0.9 upon discharge. NSAIDS should
continue to be held.
.
# Diarrhea: Now resolved. c dif negative, likely viral illness.
No abd pain or N/V.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: per NH records, has been getting tylenol.
Written for opiate but not regularly receiving. Continued that
therapy in house, and also oxybutynin.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued mirtazepine, trazadone, and
klonopin. Pt declined seeing SW or psychiatry. His affect is
very flat.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - simvastatin was decreased to 40 mg due to
black box warning on simvastatin 80 mg. LDL is <50 this
admission, so will permanently change simva to 40mg daily.
.
# CAD s/p CABG [**2184**]: continued aspirin and statin (at lower
dose)
.
# COPD on 2L O2 baseline: continued advair and spiriva with prn
albuterol.
.
# OSA: on bipap at home, but refused in house.
.
# GERD: continued PPI and H2 blocker.  Decrease PPI as no
symptoms, and did not want to overdose w/ PPI's
.
# H/o prostate ca s/p XRT: continued flomax.
.
# Mild aortic stenosis: will need to be followed long term
.
# Access on discharge: PICC
# Communication: Patient, wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95541**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95542**]

# Code: Full
==============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Chest CT scan w/ contrast in 3 weeks (to be ordered by
outpatient provider)
# Should follow up with thoracic surgery in 3 weeks to assess
empyema and see if chest tube can be removed
# While on meropenem, check weekly CBC with dif, BUN,
Creatinine, and LFTs
# should have f/u CT chest in [**2-5**] months for left lung nodule
# Should see outpatient Neurologist soon to assess for
Parkinson's disease, and further depression management w/
psychiatrist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
for a urinary tract infection, renal failure, and a lung
infection. For this, you were treated with antibiotics and IV
fluids. Your kidneys recovered very well. You also had a chest
tube put in. You improved with these treatments, but will
require more antibiotics when you leave, and the chest tube will
need to stay in for 3 weeks to completely drain the infected
fluid.

The following changes have been made to your medications
** START meropenem [antibiotic]
** because you are on meropenem, you will need to have blood
work done once weekly at your nursing home. This should be done
for you.
** DECREASE omeprazole to 40mg once daily (instead of twice
daily)
** STOP ibuprofen
** STOP compazine
** DECREASE simvastatin to 40mg daily (from 80mg daily)

Chief Complaint:
slurred speech


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG
central venous catheterization, removed [**2168-10-11**]


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 64 year-old man with PMHx of IDDM, Multiple
Sclerosis
and longterm tobacco abuse who presents with slurred speech and
worsened R-sided weakness, and was found at an OSH to have a
2.5cm pontine hemorrhage.
The hx was obtained mostly from pt's wife.  She reports that at
baseline the patient has weakness from his MS of his R leg, most
notable for a R foot drop as well as weakness of his R hand, of
which he can only use his 1st digit and thumb, and the other are
""always closed in a fist"".  He uses a walker to get around.
However, this morning he woke up and was slurring his speech,
which is unusual for him unless his blood sugar is too low.  She
checked his blood sugar and it was 30.  She gave him glucose and
[**Location (un) 2452**] juice and unlike other times it has been too low, his
slurred speech didn't improve.  In addition, she noticed that
his
R face was drooping and his R eye was at first ""too open"" and
then the eyelid was droopy.  She called 911 and he was taken to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where a CT scan showed a 2.5cm pontine hemorrhage.

He was then sent to us for further evaluation.  Of note, he was
note noted to be hypertensive at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with BP max
recorded in the 150's.  He does not have hypertension at
baseline.
When he arrived in our ED, his BP was in the 130's and he was
taken to a repeat CT scan, which showed an essentially unchanged
hemorrhage in the pons.  He was seen by neurosurgery who felt
that the bleed was too deep to intervene surgically at this
point.  His initial neurological exam showed essentially full
eye
movements and then a repeat exam 1 hour later showed inability
to
look horizontally and difficulty with downward gaze L > R.
Therefore, given the changing exam and the location of his bleed
he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.

On neuro ROS, the pt reports a mild R sided HA, [**3-26**], as well as
worsened right sided weakness, but denies loss of vision,
blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies new difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 64 year-old man with PMHx of IDDM, Multiple
Sclerosis
with baseline right side weakness and long term tobacco abuse
who
presents with slurred speech and worsened R-sided weakness, and
was found  to have a 2.5cm pontine hemorrhage in CT , confirmed
with MRI.  At the time of admission his exam was notable for
dysarthric speech, R ptosis and facial droop and R-sided
weakness
worse than his reported baseline. His pontine hemorrhage is in a
concerning location, but the etiology is not yet clear.  His
hemorrhage is a typically hypertensive location, yet the patient
doesn't have HTN nor was he reported as hypertensive at the OSH.

He was admitted to the ICU for further monitoring.

1. Hemorrhagic lesion in L pontine: in serial CT hemorrhage size
remained stable, he recieved hypertonic saline for 24 hours. A
follow-up MRI was scheduled for outpatient.
2. ID:  His urine analysis was positive for WBC and Bacteria, he
recieved 1 week of IV ceftriaxone. He developed fever and
leukocytosis again and as CXR was positive for infiltration, he
was started on cefepime, flagyl and vancomycin x 9 days
3. Feeding: he had swallowing evaluation, which showed impaired
swallowing, PEG tube placed for feeding
4. MS: Alert, oriented x3
5. Cardiovascular: TTE showed elongated left atrium but no focal
wall motion abnormalities, LVEV> 55%. He developed 2 episodes of
atrial fibrillation and recieved esmolol drip on the first
episode and diltiazem drip at the second episode. He was
subsequently started on labetalol. He was hypertensive prior to
discharge and his lisinopril was increased to 5mg.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 48612**],

You were admitted to the hospital with speech difficulties and
worsening of your right sided weakness. These were found to be
due to a stroke, a bleed in the brain, in an area called the
pons. The reason for this stroke is not yet clear.
We have made the following changes to your medications:
1. We increased your lisinopril to 5mg daily.
2. We started a medication called labetalol for atrial
fibrillation.
3. We have stopped your aspirin.

Please continue your tizanidine, gabapentin, and labetalol at
your regular doses.

You have an MRI that is tentatively scheduled for [**2168-12-2**] prior
to your appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to evaluate the area of the
bleed. Radiology will contact you with the specific time and
date.

It was a pleasure caring for you.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post cardiac arrest.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 17437**] is a 62-year-old
female who was found unresponsive by her husband at
approximately 7:00 p.m. the night of admission.  For
approximately one week prior, the patient had been having
intermittent back pain, located between the shoulders and
radiating down her arms.  The pain would come on at rest and
last several hours.  The patient was seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital
ED and told that the pain was not cardiac.  They were having
apparently normal EKGs and one negative set of cardiac
enzymes and a negative CT of the chest.  The patient was
apparently then sent home but continued to have the pain
intermittently through the next week.

On the day of admission, the patient went to the movies with
her husband.  After coming home, the patient collapsed in the
kitchen.  She was not breathing and did not have a pulse.
The patient's husband called [**Name (NI) 9168**] who came within five to ten
minutes.  An automated external fibrillator was placed and
shocked to 200 joules, restoring normal [**Name (NI) **] rhythm.  The
patient was intubated in the field and started on lidocaine
and a nitroglycerin drip.  She was given Lopressor 5 mg IV
times four and Esmolol 40 mg IV times one.

The first set at the outside hospital showed a CK of 55.9,
troponin 6.02.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization
and further evaluation and treatment.  At baseline, the
patient is very sedentary.  She has had some dyspnea on
exertion.  She has never had chest pain before.  She has had
syncope three to four times throughout her life, no known
etiology.  She has a 75 pack year history.  Occasionally, she
takes Percocet for abdominal discomfort.

4.  Percocet p.r.n.

TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lidocaine drip at 2.0 mg per minute.
2.  Nitroglycerin drip at 80 micrograms per kilogram per
minute.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

She does have some type of allergy to paper tape.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She works at a surgical supply company.  She
is married and lives with her husband, but no children in the

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Upon presentation to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, the patient had the following
physical examination.  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.3, blood
pressure 118/70, heart rate 105, [**Hospital6 **] tachycardia.  She was
on assist control ventilator with tidal volume 600,
respiratory rate 12, 75% oxygen.  She had a PEEP of 5,
saturating 99% on those settings.  General:  Intubated and
sedated, unresponsive.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light.  She had eyes roving bilaterally.  She
was anicteric.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac but regular.

echocardiography and cardiac catheterization:  The patient
has a severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction
with elevated filling pressures.  The EF is approximately
20%. The patient was clinically volume overloaded with
crackles bilaterally on examination. She was diuresed and
started on 40 p.o. q.d. of Lasix with gradual resolution of
the crackles.

She was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and
tolerated these well for her low ejection fraction.

RHYTHM:  The patient was transferred here for apparent V-fib
arrest presumed due to ischemia given the ruling in by
cardiac enzymes, findings on EKG consistent with a myocardial
infarction.  She had an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator placed two days prior to discharge.  She
experienced no ectopy the last several days of her admission.
She was rate controlled with beta blocker.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient had a stent placed to a
large OM-1 vessel following non ST elevation MI.  She
remained chest pain-free throughout the duration of her
hospital stay.  She was started on Plavix, statin, aspirin,
beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  Of note, the patient
complained of back pain through the hospital stay.  This was
certainly not ischemic.  She had no further EKG changes and
had chronic complaints of back pain prior to admission.

2.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was unconscious for
approximately five to ten minutes before being defibrillated
and regaining consciousness.  Through the hospital stay, she
had a short-term memory deficit but really no other
neurologic deficits.

She was seen by the Neurologic Service and then subsequently
by the Behavioral Neurology Consultation Service who said
that the patient had an antegrade amnesia of mild degree and
also stated that recovery from the neurological standpoint
occurs over the first three to six weeks primarily and
plateaus at three to six months and said that the patient had
a good prognosis given her rapid recovery over the
hospitalization and limited deficits.  They also recommended
that she not drive and she follow-up with Behavior Neurology,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], and was given the number
for that.

No imaging was done subsequent to the CT at the outside
hospital.  MRI was considered but given the recent placement
of the cardiac stent, it was deemed that the risk of
dislodging the stent outweighed the benefit that may be
obtained from the MRI as there would likely be no neurologic
intervention, although the prognosis might be more clear by
the MRI.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was given a seven day
course of levofloxacin for her positive leukocyte esterase
and UTI, although likely an actual urinary tract infection
seemed low.  In the setting of the V-fib arrest and her
tenuous status in the Intensive Care Unit, it was thought to
be prudent to start her on levofloxacin.  She did continue a
seven day course.

4.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has a history of anxiety.  She
was started back on her daily dose of Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d.
the day after admission and continued on her Prozac.  She was
mildly anxious and agitated for the first several days of her
hospitalization but thereafter had no further agitation
following the administration of Klonopin and the Prozac.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home with [**Name (NI) 269**], PT and OT.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest.
2.  Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Status post stent placement in obtuse marginal I branch
of the left circumflex artery.
4.  Anoxic brain injury with short-term memory loss.
5.  Urinary tract infection.
6.  Mild congestive heart failure.
7.  Left ventricular ejection fraction roughly 20%.
8.  Anxiety.
9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Atorvostatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiology.  She is to call his office for an
appointment.  She will be given the phone number.  She is
also to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Behavioral Neurology,
and has been given his phone number as well.  Finally, she
should call her internist and make an appointment for one
week following discharge for follow-up as well.

Please see the previous dictation for the initial part of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course.

A renal ultrasound was obtained as per Infectious Disease
recommendation.  It showed no evidence of hydronephrosis in
either kidney.  There was a 3 mm stone within the interpolar
region of the left kidney without evidence of obstruction.
It was decided that the patient could follow-up with
Neurology as an outpatient for further evaluation of this
kidney stone.  Based on these findings, the Infectious
Disease Consult stated that the patient would only require a
two week course of intravenous vancomycin, as well as
intravenous Ceftazidine.  They stated that he could be
switched to levofloxacin po instead of ceftazidine
intravenously upon discharge.

Upon discussion with the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he decided
to discharge the patient on Ciprofloxacin instead of
levofloxacin.  The patient remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  The patient will be discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He is scheduled with outpatient follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99750**] in the Multiple Sclerosis [**Hospital 878**]
Clinic.  As per Neurology's recommendations, the patient was
tapered off Dilantin.  He was continued on his Tegretol dose.

Chief Complaint:
melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 y/o F with a PMHx of MS, CAD s/p MI/LAD stent in
[**10/2174**], FVL def and Prot S deficiency on coumadin, presented to
an OSH with N/V/coffee ground emesis x1 week, and melena x 3
days.  She states that she has been feeling progressively weaker
over the past 2 weeks, and developed nausea with coffee ground
emesis intermittantly over the past week.  She also states that
she had black, tarry stools for the past 3 days.  She does not
know how many BMs she is having per day; last melenic stool was
9am this morning.  She was taken to an OSH for further w/u this
AM.
.
At the OSH, her HR was in the 130s with BP in the 80s; initial
hct 31 --> 24.6, intial INR 10.  Pt received 10mg IM Vit K, PPI,
2u FFP, and 1u pRBC.  An NG tube at the OSH showed coffee ground
emesis, and she was placed on Protonix gtt and taken to their GI
suite where an an EGD performed that saw copious blood in
stomach on EGD, ? duodenal angioma, ? duodenal bleeding,
although no definitive source found.  At that time, due to her
coagulopathy, no intervention was performed.  Pt was transferred
to to [**Hospital1 18**] post-EGD where she received a 2nd unit of pRBC en
route.
.
In our ED, T98.1, HR 130s, BP130/70 - received 2L NS.  Hct here
26.6, INR 2.7.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and
transfused an additional pRBC with goal hct >28 given h/o CAD;
no active ischemia at this time.  Pt had 2 large bore IV's in
place at all times and was placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Her ASA,
Plavix and coumadin were held.  GI was consulted and on HD#2 due
to ongoing melena, with an INR of 5.8, she was transfused 3u FFP
prior to having an additional EGD which was unremarkable for any
ulcer or bleeding diathesis.  Her hct remained stable over the
next day, with no further episodes of melena.  Her diet was
advanced as tolerated.  Currently she is s/p 6UPRBCs in total
with a stable HCt for >48 hours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 55 y/o F with a PMHx of MS, CAD s/p MI/LAD stent in
[**10/2174**], FVL def and Prot S deficiency on coumadin, presented to
an OSH with melena and found to have an INR of 10.
.
Plan:
# Melena/Coffee ground emesis
Pt with melena and 14 point drop in hct in the context of an INR
of 10.  Likely UGI source given melena and coagulopathy and
previous h/o duodenal AVMs seen on prior capsule endoscopy at
OSH.  Pt is s/p FFP, Vit K at OSH, INR 2.7 at time of admission.
 She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and transfused an
additional pRBC with goal hct >28 given h/o CAD; no active
ischemia at this time.  Pt had 2 large bore IV's in place at all
times and was placed on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Her ASA, Plavix and
coumadin were held.  GI was consulted and on HD#2 due to ongoing
melena, with an INR of 5.8, she was transfused 3u FFP prior to
having an additional EGD which was unremarkable for any ulcer or
bleeding diathesis.  Her hct remained stable over the next day,
with no further episodes of melena.  Her diet was advanced
as tolerated. HCT remained stable and she had no episodes of
melena or hemetemesis while inpatient.  She was maintained on
PPI [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Coagulopathy
Pt with a reported INR of 10 at OSH, unclear etiology, but
likely due to decreased PO intake over the past 2 weeks with
poor follow up of INR levels.   She received Vit K at the OSH,
and received 1mg Vit K IV as well as 3u FFP as above.  Her INR
decreased to 1.8.   Her OSH hematologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding
to restarting her anticoagulation in the setting of her GIB,
given her hypercoagulable state of +factor V leiden and protein
S deficiency.  Coumadin was resumed [**2176-6-28**] at 2mg/day, without
lovenox bridge intitially.  However, INR continued to fall from
1.8 and her coumadin was increased slowly to 5 mg PO QD and
lovenox bridge was started on [**2176-7-1**].  Her INR will NEED TO BE
FOLLOWED CLOSELY as an outpatient, with goal [**2-23**].  We would
recommend holding the coumadin at 5mg and allowing the INR to
increase slowly so as not to overshoot and precipitate a GI
bleed.  Plan to continue lovenox until INR therapeutic.
.
# hx of CAD s/p LAD stent (last ECHO nromal w. EF 55%.  EKG only
showed <1mm of ST depressions laterally; 2 sets of CE's were
negative.  Pt remained completely asymptomatic.  Her hct was
transfused as needed to maintain hct >28.  Her ASA, plavix were
held, and her cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] due to the fact that
patient had been on Plavix >18 months post-stent placement.  Her
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 121**], formerly at [**Last Name (un) 4068**]) agreed that
Plavix was no longer needed, and to continue ASA once tolerating
in regards to her GIB.  Her bblocker was initially held and then
restarted once her SBP was stable.  ASA restarted on discharge.

.
# Factor V Leiden & Protein S deficiencies
Pt with a hypercoagulable state, currently on coumadin and
Plavix for anticoagulation. Anticoagulation was initially held
in the setting of active GI bleed.  After discussion with her
cardiologist, Plavix was discontniued indefinitely.  Since she
has a stent she does require a full dose aspirin which was
re-started immediately before discharge, and after consultation
with the hematology service, coumadin  was restarted at a lower
dose than previous.  Given the amount of vitamin K she recived
at the OSH, it is likely that it will be quite some time before
patient is therapeutic and her INR should be watched very
closely as an outpatient to allow for the appropriate dose
adjustments.
.
# Chronic Pain: Patient has very complex pain issues and attends
an outpatient pain management clinic.  Continued topamax,
ultram, lidoderm patch, vicodin prn.  Nortriptiline was stopped
and trazadone was increased to 500mg PO QHS and ambien continued
at night.
.
# Mild asthma - cont albuterol
.
# Ativan PRN - Started on klonopin during this admission.  She
was on 0.5 TID, and dose was increased to 1mg [**Hospital1 **].  Consider
increasing this to 1mg TID as needed.
.
# PPx - On lovenox, PPI [**Hospital1 **]

Plavix was no longer needed, and to continue ASA once tolerating
in regards to her GIB.  Her bblocker was initially held and then
restarted once her SBP was stable.  ASA restarted on discharge.

.
# Factor V Leiden & Protein S deficiencies
Pt with a hypercoagulable state, currently on coumadin and
Plavix for anticoagulation. Anticoagulation was initially held
in the setting of active GI bleed.  After discussion with her
cardiologist, Plavix was discontniued indefinitely.  Since she
has a stent she does require a full dose aspirin which was
re-started immediately before discharge, and after consultation
with the hematology service, coumadin  was restarted at a lower
dose than previous.  Given the amount of vitamin K she recived
at the OSH, it is likely that it will be quite some time before
patient is therapeutic and her INR should be watched very
closely as an outpatient to allow for the appropriate dose
adjustments.
.
# Chronic Pain: Patient has very complex pain issues and attends
an outpatient pain management clinic.  Continued topamax,
ultram, lidoderm patch, vicodin prn.  Nortriptiline was stopped
and trazadone was increased to 500mg PO QHS and ambien continued

Intubation [**2171-5-25**]

History of Present Illness:
62 year-old right-handed F who presented from her nursing home
via EMS actively seizing. History is per EMS and scarce medical
records. The patient was last seen normal at 1pm and presents
after 45min of focal motor seizure activity and
decreased responsiveness. This consisted of left eye deviation
and left arm convulsive activity. She was intubated by EMS and
received valium 5mg en route to no effect. Here, she received
ativan 2mg IV x 2, 5 min apart and motor activity ceased. She
remained with left eye deviation until after a third round of
ativan. Propofol has of yet been held due to low systolic blood
pressure on
attempted administration.

NCHCT [**5-25**]
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Extensive chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
3. Extensive calvarial hyperostosis, of uncertain etiology.
Focal lytic lesion in the clivus is likely fibrous dysplasia.

MRI/MRA [**5-26**]
Extensive T2 signal abnormality within the white matter of the
brain. Normal MRA.

CXR [**5-28**]:
New opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent with
aspiration given the clinical history. Cardiomediastinal
contours are normal. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Small atelectasis is in the
left base.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  NEURO - The patient arrived intubated with a non-focal exam,
but with bilateral upgoing toes and only sparse medical history.
A NCHCT revealed no bleed. An MRI the next day revealed
extensive white matter disease, with a maximum around the corpus
callosum. There are no data to suggest CADASIL: No microbleeds
on GRE, no temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] involvement of the WN lesions, no
family history. Tox-screen and basic screening labs including
U/A were negative.

Depakote level was 44 ug/mL, non-trough. She was bolused with
VPA twice over the next 24 hours, as her repeat level remained
44. Of note, the values of VPA have been as high as 129, but
none of the levels is a ""true trough"". Her maintenance dose was
increased to a total of 2500 mg QD, divided in 3 IV doses in the
ICU but switched to [**Hospital1 **] PO on transfer to floor. LFTs were
normal.

There was no further seizure activity. She had an EEG done which
showed semirhythmic theta range activity with occasional sharp
waves in the R anterior temporal region, and a disorganized, low
voltage BG with a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.

Clinically she woke up slowly over the course of 3 days in the
ICU. Her prolonged recovery time is not surprising given the
prolonged seizure, the limited cerebral reserves at baseline and
the benzodiazepines she received.  She returned to her baseline
the day after transfer without any further concerns.  A repeat
Depakote level was 122 with goal of >80.  It was felt that she
was too sedated on this Depakote dose (1250mg [**Hospital1 **]) and therefore
was decreased back to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] as her status epilepticus was
likely triggered by her acute pneumonia.

2.  RESP - She was noted to have a pneumonia while on the
respirator, with a suspicion of aspiration. She spiked high
fever and CXR confirmed a RLL infiltrate. She was started on
Piperacillin-Tazobactam Na 4.5g IV Q8H and Vancomycin 1000mg
Q12H on [**2171-5-28**]. She was remained in the ICU one day
post-extubation due to excessive suctioning requirements. She
was weaned quickly to room air which she remained at upon
discharge.

3.  ID - Pneumonia as above. She had a fever on admission and
was given Ceftriaxone 2 grams x 1 and Vancomycin 1 gram x 1, as
well as Ampicillin 2 grams IV x 1 and Acyclovir 800 mg IV x 1 -
per ED clinician order sheet in chart.  LP on admission was
sterile including Gram stain, culture no growth.  A blood
culture on [**2171-5-25**] grew coagulase negative staph with repeat
negative x 3.  Two respiratory cultures grew only normal flora.
She was treated with 10 days of antibiotics (zosyn &
vancomycin).  MRSA/VRE cultures were negative.

4.  CARDIOV - Metoprolol 10 IV Q4H switched to 12.5 mg TID in
the ICU.  This was subsequently changed to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and 25mg q
HS for increased blood pressure.  Upon transfer there were no
further concerns.

5.  FEN/Endo - On D51/2NS in the ICU and D5NS upon transfer to
the floor.  Started on tube feeds with a speech/swallow
evaluation concering for aspiration.  A video swallow study
showed aspiration with all consistencies and no voluntary cough.
 Therefore, a GJ-tube was placed on [**2171-6-3**].  Feeds were
restarted with Replete plus fiber for a goal of 55ml/hr which
she tolerated.

CT Head
FINDINGS: Examination is limited by motion artifact however no
evidence of
acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction is seen.
Prominence of
the ventricles and sulci reflects generalized atrophy. Areas of
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likely
reflect
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There are
calcifications of
the carotid siphons. The osseous structures are not well
evaluated however a
lytic focus in the clivus appears grossly unchanged, possibly
representing a
focus of fibrous dysplasia. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
grossly
clear.

IMPRESSION:
Motion-limited examination. However no acute intracranial
process identified.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


EEG:
BACKGROUND: Was generally a low voltage fast pattern, but much
of the
record was obscured by constant movement artifact.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal sleeping patterns were evident. The background
remained a low voltage fast pattern throughout.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Probably normal EEG in wakefulness. Muscle artifact
dominated the recording, but there were legible portions. These
showed
a low voltage fast record throughout. This can be the normal
background
in a waking, eyes-open state. There were no areas of prominent
focal
slowing, and there were no clearly epileptiform features.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female with advanced MS, dementia, schizophrenia, seizure
disorder who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] with altered mental status found
to have seizure and UTI.
.
# Altered mental status/Seizure - Likely triggered by UTI.
Patient does not have Neurologist per [**Hospital1 1501**]. Her valproate level
was low, but she reportedly missed am dose. CT head negative.
Neurology was consulted.  20 min EEG unremarkable.  Her mental
status quickly returned to [**Location 213**]/baseline with treatment of her
UTI.  She was transferred from the ICU to the medical floor on
[**2174-3-29**] and was back at her baseline mental status on [**2174-3-30**].
Her clonazepam and depakote were continued.
She will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] Clinic (Neurology) for
further management of her epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.
.
# Urinary tract infection - Patient hemodyamically stable, but
U/A was positive with fever.  Urine grew proteus (see culture
data above).  She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and
will complete a 10 day course of cefpodoxime.  We recommend
starting [**Hospital 96355**] [**Hospital 96356**] 1 gram twice a day upon
completion of cefpodoxime for UTI prophylaxis.
.
# Tachycardia - Patient with sinus tach. By report up to 140s in
ED. Likely in setting of seizure and fever. currently in 110s.
Patient appears euvolemic currently. Her metoprolol was
restarted with resolution of the tachycardia.
.
#Hypoxia: The patient was noted to have occasional desats to the
80's.  She improved to 95-100% with deep breathing.  This is
likely due to atelectesis due to mental status changes
surrounding the seizure.  There is a small chance of an
aspiration pneumonitis, however, chest x ray was clear.  She is
therefore being discharged on oxygen.  She should have Vital
Signs checked three times daily, including oxygen sat.  Wean off
oxygen as tolerated to maintain pulse ox >94%.  If her oxygen
requirement persists for 3 days, she should have a repeat PA and
Lateral chest X ray.
.
# Hypertension - Continued on metoprolol and lisinopril.
.
# Diabetes - Metformin initially held but restarted prior to
discharge.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Seizure
Bacterial UTI

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a seizure.  You were found to
have a urinary tract infection; this was the likely trigger for
your seizure. You were seen by neurology who did not recommend
changes to your depakote but who would like to see you in clinic
in follow up.

We have added an antibiotic for a 7 days (cefpodoxime).  You
should discuss with your doctors [**First Name (Titles) 3380**] [**Last Name (Titles) 96355**] [**Name5 (PTitle) 96356**]
1 gram twice a day once you complete the cefpodoxime to prevent
recurrent UTIs in the future.

You were noted to have low oxygen levels occasionally.  A chest
x ray was normal.  This may be due to atelectesis vs a small
amount of aspiration during your seizure.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] in the Neurology - [**Hospital **] Clinic at on
[**4-29**] at 9:00 AM. [**Hospital1 18**], [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 8.

and records, pt appeared unwell this evening and was sent to ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt initially triggered for tachypnea to 30s and
tachycardia to 170s. She was also febrile to 105. Pt was
immediately intubated for respiratory distress. Post intubation
CXR demonstrated RML opacity. UA was also showed concerning for
UTI. Labs were significant for leukocytosis to 15 with prominent
bandemia (15%), lactate of 5.3, as well as Mg to 1.3, Ca 7.3 and
phos of 2.2. Pt was given 4LNS, Vancomycin, and Zosyn. MAPs were
notable to be in low 60s while on propofol so switched to
fent/midaz with MAPs increasing to mid 60s. CVP was not
recorded. MAPS continue drift downward and pt was started
norepinephrine. Prior to transfer patient developed small amount
of ""burgundy colored output with coffee grounds,"" which cleared
with 100cc of NS. Pt was then transferred to ICU for further
management. VS prior to transfer were Temp 100.6 HR 107 BP

Imaging
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2174-10-10**])
Final Report
INDICATION: Polymicrobial bacteremia, assess for intra-abdominal
infection.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet
to the pubic symphysis after the administration of intravenous
and oral
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.

COMPARISONS: None available.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Thyroid gland is normal in
appearance with
symmetric enhancement. The aorta and major branches are patent
with normal
three-vessel arch. Left-sided PICC line is seen terminating in
the proximal
SVC. Mediastinum is unremarkable. The heart and pericardium are
normal,
without pericardial effusion. The esophagus is normal.

The trachea and central airways are patent to the segmental
level. Nodular
and ground glass opacities in the left upper lobe is worrisome
for infective
process. Retrocardiac opacitiy, likely atelectasis, is
demonstrated. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 1 cm left axillary node
is noted with
normal fatty hilum. No other enlarged nodes are seen by CT
criteria.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Please note, assessment is
limited due to
the fact that the arms are down.

The liver is normal in attenuation without focal lesion, intra-
or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The gallbladder is
minimally
distended. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands
are
unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically, though
excretory phase is
not fully imaged as contrast is not in the ureters, though it is
in the
collecting systems.

Stomach is nondistended with gastrostomy tube noted. The stomach
and small
bowel are unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid in
the abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The
aorta and
major branches appear patent with moderate atherosclerotic
calcification.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder is somewhat
decompressed with
Foley and air inside. The uterus and adnexae are unremarkable.
The rectum is
normal. There is no free pelvic fluid. There is no pelvic or
inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion
concerning for
osseous malignant process.

IMPRESSION: Patchy opacification in the left upper lobe is
concerning for
pneumonia or aspiration. Retrocardiac opacity, likely
atelectasis, cannot
exclude infection.

PORTABLE CXR ([**2174-10-12**])
HISTORY: Extubated.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**10-11**], the endotracheal tube
has been
removed though the central catheter remains in place. There are
streaks of
atelectasis at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise clear
with no
evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or cardiomegaly or
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 y.o. woman with advanced MS, schizophrenia, dementia,
dysphagia  who came in from [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2174-9-24**] with resp distress,
fevers, found to be in septic shock due to Right middle lobe
pneumonia from a possible aspiration.  She was intubated on
presentation, extubated [**2174-9-27**] and transferred to the floor on
[**2174-9-30**] on RA, reintubated on [**2174-10-8**] and extubated [**2174-10-11**],
transferred back to the floor on [**2174-10-12**].  Her course was
complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (thought to be secondary to ATN) - this
ultimately resolved.
.
#HCAP/ GNR bacteremia -The patient presented with respiratory
failure requiring intubation and was treated for pneumonia with
vancomycin and zosyn.  She was pressors while in the ICU but was
weaned off. Pt completed a 7 day course of vanc/zosyn but on
[**10-1**] she had a fever of 101.1 with blood cultures from the PICC
line growing GNR - picc removed, tip cultured negative.
Pneumonia felt to be likely source. Urine cultures showed only
fecal contamination.  Sputum cultures did not show any specific
organism for the pneumonia.  Blood cultures grew Pseudomonas and
Klebsiella, initially started on Meropenem, but then switched to
Tobramycin and Cefepime after the sensitivies returned and
Infectious Disease was consulted.  She had a new PICC placed and
will need to have 14 day courses of Tobramycin ([**Date range (1) 96358**]) for
blood stream infection and Cefepime for HCAP/VAP ([**Date range (1) 96359**]).
Given her thick secretions, she has been started on a
scopolamine patch with good effect.  She is currently stable on
room air.
The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], is aware that pt
is at high risk for recurrent episodes of aspiration and that
the patient may benefit from tracheostomy.  The ICU team
discussed this extensively with the HCP, however, at this time,
she is deferring this option.  This is partly because the
patient's son is also a HCP for the pt, but is currently serving
in the Army in [**Country 2451**], and is not available to participate in the
discussion.
.
#HTN:The patient was initially hypotensive on pressors but then
was weaned off and subsequently restarted on her Metoprolol at
higher dose to avoid her ACEI due to [**Last Name (un) **]. She was restarted
lisinopril at 5 mg po daily when her Cr normalized but Cr rose
slightly so it was d/ced and metoprolol was uptitrated.  She
briefly required the addition of amlodipine 5 mg for BP control.
 Her hypertension is currently well controlled with metoprolol
only.
.
#[**Last Name (un) **]: It was initially felt to be likely ATN. Creatinine
downtrended to 1.1 with IVF.  It rose slightly with reinitiation
of her ACE-I, so it has been discontinued indefinitely until she
is followed-up as an outpatient.  She maintained good output and
is incontinent at baseline.  Random bladder scan showed only 130
ml residual.  Her BUN/Cr should continue to be monitored,
especially since she is on Tobramycin which has nephrotoxicity.
If her renal function declines, she will need her Tobramycin
levels checked for possible dosing readjustment.
.
#GI bleed: The patient was noted to have a small amt coffee
ground emesis in ED which cleared w/ 100 cc lavage. It was
presumed stress gastritis and she was placed on a PPI.  Her
hematocrit did downtrend to 20.9, but she responded
appropriately to 1 unit PRBC blood transfusion and has remained
stable since.  A CT chest/abdomen/pelvis did not show any source
of active bleeding.
.
#Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures in the
setting of sepsis. Although there was a question of seizure like
activity at admission, she had no further episodes after
extubation and was continued on her Depakote.  Neurology was
consulted, they did not think she was having breakthrough
seizures.  They did increase her Depakote dose after levels were
low, likely due to interaction with Meropenem.  Her goal
Depakote levels are 50 - 60, and she will require repeat blood
levels.  She had a bedside EEG that on prelim read shows no
status epilepticus.
.
#DM: Given her [**Last Name (un) **], metformin was discontinued and she is being
treated with a Lispro sliding scale.
.
#FEN:The patient was restarted on her tube feeds for a goal of
60ml/hr of Promote with fiber at 20 hrs/day.  However, it was
changed to Glucerna with beneprotein as she had elevated blood
sugars.
.
#Access: She initially had a central line in the ICU and had a
PICC line placed.  When bacteremic, the PICC line was d/ced and

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 64yo F with a history of advanced MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 96361**], HTN, HLD, DM2, tardive dyskinesia with recent
hosptialization for HCAP and klebsiella/pseudomonas bacteremia
who presents from her nursing home with seizures.

She arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED actively seizing, requiring 4mg of
IV/IM lorazepam prior to cessation.  Estimated duration of
seizure around 30minutes.  She required NRB for desaturations to
unknown level, but was alert enough to protect her airway.  She
was febrile to 100.3 with sinus tachycardia to 130.  She
received 3L NS, vancomycin 1g, and zosyn.  CXR with likely [**Hospital1 25730**]
atalectasis.  CT head without evidence of acute intracranial
process.  Neurology was consulting, who felt that her seizure
was related to systemic infection and subtherapeutic depakote
level at 35.  She receivedd 1g valproic acid and was
subsequently admitted to the MICU.  Vitals at the time of
transfer were T100.3 P130 BP158/96 Sat 98%venturi mask.

On arrival to the unit, her initial VS were: T 100.3 BP162/80
P120 RR30 Sats100% on 50%mask.  She is nearly nonverbal at
baseline.  She could not respond to further questions.

She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-24**] to [**10-14**] for
respiratory failure and sepsis requiring both intubation and
pressor support.  She completed 7d of vanco/zosyn, though became
febrile with resistant pseudomonas and klebsiella blood stream
infection of unclear source that was treated with tobramycin and
cefepime for 14 days.  She was also admitted to the general
medicine floor from [**Date range (1) 3697**] after her G-tube fell out; this
was replaced without incident.

She has a history of tonic colonic seizures particularly while
septic.  Of note, her valproic acid level has recently
fluctuately widely, having been supratherapeutic at 115 during
her last admission and subtherapeutic currently ay 35.  It is
thought that a meropenem interaction may have been the cause.

Review of systems:  could not be elicited.

Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission:

Head CT
No acute intracranial process.
.
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. There
has been interval removal of previously seen left PICC. A patchy

opacification at the left lung base is seen, which could be due
to infection or aspiration. There is also mild elevation of the
left hemidiaphragm. The right lung is clear. No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
unremarkable.

Minimal degenerative changes are seen at bilateral
acromioclavicular joints.

IMPRESSION: Mild patchy opacity at the left lung base could be
due to
atelectasis, however, underlying aspiration or infection is not
excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old female with a history of advanced MS
and schizophrenia, HTN, HLD, DM2, tardive dyskinesia with recent
hosptialization for HCAP and klebsiella/pseudomonas bacteremia
who presents with seizures in the setting of likely UTI and
subtheraputic depakote level.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# SEIZURES:  Patient most likely had a seizure as a result of a
subtherapeutic valproate level on admission (35) and systemic
inflammatory syndrome from a UTI.  These seizures were broken
with ativan and pt was placed on depakote and keppra per neuro.
Patient was supratheraputic on depakote on discharge (125).  She
was seizure free for the remainder of the hospitalization.

# UTI/SIRS: On admission pt met criteria for SIRS with a fever,
sinus tachycardia, leukocytosis to 16.9 and a PMN predominance.
Potential etiolgies included a urinary source as well as [**3-9**]
seizure.  Patient was aggressively hydrated with NS ~4L to
resolve tachycardia.  Initially her UTI was covered with
cefepime and tobramycin given her recent history of resistant
klebsiella and pseudomonas blood infections a month ago of
unclear source.  Urine culture was positive for VRE.  Patient
was sent to her [**Hospital1 1501**] with Linezolid 600mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10 days through
[**2174-11-14**].

# HYPOXEMIA:  Patient was on a NRB in the ED with unclear
desaturations. Her CXR appeared to be without parenchymal
disease though ?atelectasis vs infiltrate in [**Last Name (LF) 25730**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her
desaturations may have been a sedative effect from ativan.  She
also had a history of desaturating from mucous plugging.  While
patien has copious secretions during the remainder of her
hospitalization, with aggressive suctioning she have good oxygen
saturations on room air.

# DIABETES TYPE 2:  Blood glucose was well controlled on sliding
scale insulin.  Lantus 5units at night was added to her regimen.
 This medication can be uptitrated by her [**Hospital1 1501**] if sugars continue
to be high.

# HTN: continue metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]

# HLD: continued on zocor

# DEMENTIA: per report patient may answer simple questions.
However, she was nonresponsive during entire hospitalization.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

-Pt with f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for epsilepsy evaluation in a few
weeks.  Neurology will transition pt from depakote to keppra for
seizure prophylaxis

-Pt will complete a ten day course of antibiotics (Linezolid
600mg [**Hospital1 **]) for her UTI.

seizure at your [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] center.   The seizure stopped with
medications and you did not have another seizure during this
hospitalization.  We beleive that your seizure was caused by a
low level of your anti-seizure medication.  We found that you
also have a urinary tract infection.  We increased the dose of
your home anti-seizure medication and added another medcation to
help prevent seizures.  We also treated your urinary tract
infection with an antibiotic called Linezolid that you will need
to take for 10 more days, through [**2174-11-14**].
.
During your hospitalization you had an elevated blood pressure,
for which we added two extra blood pressure medications.

g-tube fell out

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Replacement of G-tube.


History of Present Illness:
64F nonverbal at baseline, recently discharged after a
hospitalization for UTI with Sepsis who was initially sent in
from her [**Hospital1 1501**] for simple G tube replacement, which was found to
be out at 6PM. On arrival found to be tachycardic, T 100.4, PR
tylenol given. Recently admitted for sepsis.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 98.4 86 126/76 18 97%, multiple
attempts to place a foley in her G-Tube track failed, and per
report the patient was noted to become tachycardic. Her
temperature was then noted to rise to 100.4 and she received PR
tylenol. Throughout the course of the night her BPs began to
dwindle down. Her IV access was a single peripheral 22G IV, and
thus a RIJ was placed. After 2L IVF her BPs increased to the
130's systolic. Given her recent history of VRE UTIs, and
current impressive pyuria she was given IV linezolid and ctx in
the ED. She never required pressors.
.
Of note, a note from her most recent hospitalization revealed
that her HCP is leaning towards DNR/DNI and hospice care.
.
On the floor, she appears well, she is afebrile with otherwise
normal vitals.
.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2174-12-8**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

BLOOD CULTURES: NGTD x 2

CXR [**12-7**]: Right IJ catheter in proximal SVC. No pneumothorax.
CXR [**12-7**]: Right lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
64F with MMP presented to the hospital because G-tube fell out,
found to have hypotension and fever concerning for sepsis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# sepsis/hypotension:  blood cultures still pending so unsure if
pt was truly septic or if she was hypotensive for other reasons.
 Pt was febrile on admission and had also lost G-tube access and
so had poor po intake prior to admission.  Hypotension could be
multifactorial secondary to volume depletion, febrile
vasodilatation, or infection.  U/A was dirty on admission and pt
has chronic foley placement.  However, UCx was negative.  Also
found to have right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR concerning for
pneumonia.  Gave pt tylenol and 2 liters of fluid rescucitation
in ED.  Hypotension and fevers subsequently resolved and she was
normotensive and afebrile by the time she reached MICU floor and
remained so throughout hospital course.  Treated pt empirically
initially with linezolid/cefepime/tobra because of her history
of resistant UTIs.  However, palliative care was consulted and
confirmed that patient had been made DNR/DNI in the past with
comfort measures only and plan was to only return to hospital
for g-tube replacement.  Therefore, IV antibiotics were stopped
and pt was given prescription for oral cefpodoxime for total 5
day course to treat infection with plans to not treat or
hospitalize should infection recur.

# nutrition/G-tube - replaced G-tube by IR while in house and
resumed tube feeds and po meds.

# comfort care: Per above, pt is comfort measures only with no
plans for further hospitalization.  Adjusted patient's home
medications upon discharge as follows: stopped simvastatin for
CAD/HLD; stopped heparin for DVT ppx; stopped Vit. C,
multivitamin, and Vit. D; stopped Amlodipine and Lisinopril for
hypertension; stopped [**Month/Day (2) **] for infection prophylaxis

INACTIVE ISSUES:

#  Seizure d/o - gave home seizure meds by IV while awaiting
g-tube replacement.  After placement, switched back to po meds.
Will continue for comfort.

# diabetes: continued pt on SSI.  will continue insulin glargine
and insulin lispro as outpatient

# COPD: continued ipratropium, albuterol nebs

ct abd/pelvis scan:. Normal-caliber aorta in the chest and
abdomen. Mildly dilated esophagus. This probably relates to the
patient's underlying history of multiple sclerosis. Dependent
bibasilar opacities, paricularly on the left, may relate to
aspiration.  Uncomplicated cholelithiasis.  Dilatation of the
distal ureters bilaterally.  Dilated distal ureters enter the
bladder normally without stones or evidence of distal
obstruction. Along with bladder wall thickening, this finding
likely relates to the patient's known history of self
catheterization for bladder spasticity secondary to multiple
sclerosis.

head ct: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage
identified. There is no mass effect or shift of the normally
midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and symmetrical. [**Doctor Last Name **] and white matter differentation is
preserved. No major vascular territorial infarction is seen.
Bone windows show no suspicious lesions. Mucosal thickening is
seen in the ethmoid air cells.

CXR on admission- normal


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to MICU intubated due to concern for his airway in
setting of change in mental status.  He was extubated and called
out to a regular floor the next day.

Hypotension: In the ED, his sbp was in the 60s and responded to
fluids.  He had one other episode of fluid responsive
hypotension during his stay likely from hypovolemia from
diarrhea.  He remains euvolemic at discharge.

HTN: Initially his bp medications were held because of his
hypotension and for concern for sepsis.  His diltiazem was
changed to a metoprolol because of concern for ischemia.  His
blood pressure was well controlled on BB and his ace-i was
restarted.

ARF: He had pre-renal acute renal failure from dehydration.  His
ace-i was initially held.  This resolved with IVFs.  His
creatinine was 3.1 on admission and came down to 1.0 which is
down from 1.3 at his previous discharge.

Agitation/altered mentalstatus: Pt does not tolerate missing a
dose of his baclofen.  A CT scan of his head did not reveal an
acute process.

CAD: He was admitted with an elevated troponin in the setting of
hypotension.  He did complain of a mild pleuritic chest pain
that resolved quickly on its own.  This was similar to pains he
has an outpatient.  His troponin trended down.  An
echocardiogram did not reveal wall motion abnormailty, however
the windows were poor.  He has an estimated EF of 70% and
significant eccentric AR.  He declined aspirin because of
bleeding with his self-catheterization in the past.  He was
changed from diltiazem to metoprolol.  He had another episode of
chest/abd pain that appeared to be similar to his chronic ""gas""
pain.  He was monitored for ischemia again but did not have an
increase in cardiac enymes or ekg changes.  Consider outpatient
stress test.

Early satiety/gi chronic pain: Pt was in the process of a work
up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He had a recent egd with a gastric bezoar
that was broken up by the scope.  On the day of admission, he
had been scheduled for an upper gi series.  Pt still complains
of symptoms of fullness and pain.  GI was consulted.  He will
need an outpatient colonoscopy given his age and family h/o
colon cancer.  He will continue with a PPI, simethicine and
maalox.  Follow-up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.  Reglan
discontinued and received upper gi series and small bowel
follow-through demonstrating- normal transit time and normal
terminal ileum.  The upper tract view was some what limitied due
to patient's difficulty with movement.

UTI: Highly resistant Klebsiella requiring iv zosyn.  Picc
placed and will need two weeks of iv abx.  Pt reuses his rubber
catheters at home after cleaning with warm water and soap.  It
was suggested that he start to use sterile catheters each time.
His concern is for discomfort and I recommended lidocaine gel.
14 day course of zosyn.

Wrist pain:  He has a history of pseudogout that he describes as
being similar in nature to his current pain.  He was started on
vioxx for 7 days, which his pcp stated he had tolerated in the
past.  In addition, the area was iced and kept elevated.
Because of his multiple sclerosis, his functional capability is
limited because of wrist pain.  OT was consulted.  He is not
able to self-cathaterize himself or move himself from the bed to
his chair which he can do at baseline.  Once this pain resolves,
his foley should be removed and replaced with intermittent
catheterization.

Diarrhea:  He was recently admitted with diarrhea, hypotension
and hypovolemia [**8-6**].  His diarrhea recurred and he was found to
have c.diff.  He will be treated with a course of metronidazole
x 14days.

FEN: Low residual cardiac diet.  At rehab he should receive ivfs
as needed until has good po intake and while diarrhea continues.

.
CXR [**2-24**]:  Right diaphragmatic elevation with bibasilar
atelectasis. An underlying consolidation is not excluded, and
dedicated PA and lateral chest x-ray is recommended.
.
CXR [**2-25**]:  unchanged from prior
CXR [**3-1**]:  Some right basilar atelectasis is demonstrated, but
no definite new infiltrate is seen.  Fluid status is within
normal limits and unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is normal.

[**2-24**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute inflammatory process within the abdomen
or pelvis. Status post total colectomy with right lower quadrant
ileostomy.
2. Bibasilar airspace disease, likely atelectasis.
3. Left adrenal nodule, not completely characterized on this
examination, further evaluation with dedicated adrenal CT or MRI
is recommended.
4. Right hepatic hypodense lesion, too small to characterize.
.
LE USN: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis,
bilaterally.
.
RUQ USN: Sludge and stones identified within the gallbladder. No
evidence of cholecystitis or biliary dilatation.
.
[**2-27**] Abd/Pelvic CT: 1. No significant change from study
performed three days prior, with no new acute inflammatory
process within the abdomen or pelvis identified.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated segmental
atelectasis, right greater than left.
3. Nodular appearance of left adrenal gland again not completely
characterized on this CT.
4. Unchanged small hypoattenuating lesion within the liver.
5. Tiny pulmonary nodule within the right lung. In the absence
of malignancy, followup imaging within a year would be
recommended to document stability.
.
abd XR:No evidence of obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.
Left basilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58yo woman with end stage multiple sclerosis
presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, fever, abdominal pain,
and mental status change which was diagnosed as urosepsis who is
s/p MICU stay, now on meropenem.
.
1. Fever, hypotension, and MS change: The patient's fever,
hypotension, and MS change were thought to be secondary to
urosepsis given her + UA. She had an elevated lactate on
admission and quickly became hypotensive. She was transferred to
the MICU, fluid resuscitated, and continued on
levofloxacin/vancomycin/metronidazole which was then changed to
Aztreonam given her allergy history when her UA came back
positive for proteus. A CXR was obtained and was concerning for
pneumonia vs atelectasis. However, given no h/o cough, sputum
production, chest pain, or SOB, or oxygen requirement, this
finding was attributed to atelectasis. The ddx also included
adrenal insufficiency since patient likely treated with steroids
for MS flares, and autonomic disregulation given h/o central
neurologic degenerative disease. A cortisol stimulation test was
preformed with a bump in cortisol level of only 6. However, at
this point the patient's hypotension had improved while on
empiric antibiotics. Urine and blood cx were negative. The
patient was hemodynamically stable with decreasing leukocytosis
and was transferred to the floor. She spiked with a bump in her
WBC ct and her coverage was broadened to meropenem and
vancomycin. She subsequently defervesced and her leukocytosis
resolved. She remained afebrile for > 48 hrs and vanco was
discontinued. She remained afebrile for an additional 48 hrs and
the patient was deemed well enough to be discharged on an
additional 7 day course of IV meropenem. The PICC line is ready
to use and may be pulled after completion of her 7 day course of
meropenem.
.
2. Tachycardia:  the patient remianed in sinus tachycardia
througout the duration of her hospitalization. The differential
included anxiety, pain, resolving hypotension/infection, and PE.
Given the patients abd pain, pain seemed a plausible etiology.
LENIs were obtained which were neg for PE and the pt did not
have an O2 requirement. Her tachycardia improved during the
duration of her hospitalization.
.
3. Abd pain:  The patient complained of persistent abdominal
pain throughout the course of her hospitalization. She had two
CT of abd/pelvis which were negative for obstruction, colitis,
pancreatitis, or abcess. Her LFTs were unremarkable.  She was
stooling well through her ostomy.  C diff was negative x 2. As
the patient had some skin breakdown around her ostomy site, this
was proposed to be the cause of her pain. She was also started
on Reglan with the thought that gastric motility may have been
affected, causing her abdominal pain and nausea. Also, the
epigastric location of her pain makes PUD a possible etiology.
Her PPI was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her abdominal pain resolved
despite continued TTP upon exam.
.
4.  MS:  The patient has end stage MS. she was continued on
Copaxone and Baclofen per her outpt regimen.

Chief Complaint:
Fever.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
On [**2195-3-17**] a left internal jugular line was placed.  On [**2195-3-24**]
a PICC was placed and the IJ was pulled.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 58 year old woman with a history of end-stage MS,
who is aphasic at baseline but can communicate through head
nods, presents with one day of fever, tachycardia (130s), and
mental status changes.  She was started on levofloxacin and
metronidazole at her nursing home for empiric coverage of
pneumonia on [**2195-3-16**].  By head nods, she denies chest pain,
fevers or chills, pain in her abdomen, nausea, vomiting, vaginal
itching or pain.
.
She was discharged on [**2195-3-7**] following admission with similar
symptoms (elevated lactate, elevated WBCs, fever, positive UA,
urine cultures with proteus, and hypotension) on which she was
found to have proteus urosepsis. She was discharged with seven
days of meropenem and sent out with a PICC line in place.  She
finished meropenem course four days prior to admission, but PICC
line was still in place.  Her only other complaint at that time
was pelvic/lower abdominal pain thought to be secondary to
peri-ostomy skin irritation and possible slowed gastric
motility. CT did not show any evidence of pathology. PPI was
increased to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, she had a fever of 101, and there was report of frank
pus from the catheter. UA was negative.  WBC was 14.1, and
lactate was initially 2.2.  She was admitted to the MICU due to
increased nursing needs.  Her vitals were 97.3, 99, 128/49, 17,
99% on 2L NC, 2630/1000.  A central line was placed.  She was
started on merepenem, ceftriaxone, vancomycin empirically for
presumed proteus infection.  Following hydration with five
liters normal saline, repeat lactate was 0.9, and hematocrit
dropped from 39 to 30.5.  Blood culture showed enterococcus,
with sensitivities pending, so linezolid was added for VRE
coverage.  PICC line was pulled and the tip was sent for
culture.  Urine cultures were negative.  She had a CXR which
showed bibasilar atelectasis and could not rule out an
underlying consolidation.  Abdominal and pelvic CT showed no
acute inflammatory process.  Pelvic US was negative. Pelvic
swabs are pending. Urine and blood cultures are pending.

.
Imaging:
Toe Xray ([**3-19**]):  Focal area of osteopenia in the first
metatarsal head, cannot rule out osteomyelitis, clinical
correlation is requested.
.
TRANSVAGINAL US [**2195-3-18**]: Normal pelvic ultrasound, no free
pelvic fluid or collection; small nabothian cyst of the cervix
.
ECHO [**2195-3-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen
(cannot exclude).
.
EKG [**2195-3-17**]: Sinus tachycardia. Indeterminate axis. Late
precordial QRS transition. Findings are non-specific but
clinical correlation is suggested for possible chronic pulmonary
disease. Since the previous tracing of [**2195-2-24**] no significant
change.
.
CT ABD AND PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2195-3-17**]: 1. Persistent right lower
lobe consolidative opacity, which could represent atelectasis,
although pneumonia is also possible. 2. Similar appearance of
stones and sludge within the gallbladder, including a partly
calcified stone in the gallbladder neck. If cholecystitis is
suspected clinically as a cause for fever, ultrasound could be
helpful to evaluate further. No inflammatory change is seen by
CT, however. 3. Status post colectomy with ileostomy. 4. Fluid
in the vagina.
.
CXR [**2195-3-17**]: Right lower lobe atelectasis and persistent right
hemidiaphragm elevation. Left lower lobe atelectasis and
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 58 year old female with a history of
multiple sclerosis and aphasia, presents with one day history of
fever, tachycardia, mental status changes, and abdominal
tenderness following recent admission for urosepsis, treated
with meropenem and PICC line left in place four days after
completed course.
.
# FEVER: On admission, there was frank pus from her picc
catheter. WBC was elevated at 14.1. She was started on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone, although urinalysis did not indicate
urinary tract infection. Chest xray was not significantly
changed from her prior visit, which was thought to represent
atelectasis, though could not rule out pneumonia. She has
persistent lower abdominal and pelvic pain, and on CT was noted
to have intermediate density fluid in vagina and sludge and
gallbladder neck stone.  AST/ALT/AP/Tbili were all within
normal. Pelvic ultrasound was negative, examination and cultures
consistent with yeast, and she was treated with one dose of
fluconazole, and cultures for chlamydia and gonorrhea were
negative.  Blood cultures were positive for enterococcus,
initially empirically covered for vancomycin resistant
enterococcus.  She was initially started on linezolid for two
days, and was switched to vancomycin when cultures showed
sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, and vancomycin.  She has a
penicillin allergy that causes limited rash, however per
ptatient may also have had shortness of breath with penicillin
in past.  TTE on [**2195-3-18**] did not reveal any vegetations.  TEE
was considered, but bacteremia was thought  most likely to be
transient, as no leaflet thickening on TTE.  Catheter tip
cultures were negative.  Surveillance cultures have been ordered
each day and continue to be negative since first set of
enterococcus.  Patient had a lesion (necrotic versus cellulitic)
on 1st right metatarsal, so ID recommended a  toe radiograph,
which shows an area of focal osteopenia, and no clear
osteomyelitis.  Swabs of the wound were positive for coagulase
positive staphylococcus and bacitracin ointment was recommended
for four days.  For the positive blood cultures, ID recommended
vancomycin for two weeks only.  A PICC was placed on day of
discharge so patient can be discharged to her home care facility
for the remainder of her course of vancomycin.  Please be sure
to pull her PICC line immediately after finishing the final dose
of vancomycin so as to decrease further risk of infection. WBC
continued to trend downwards for duration of admission, and
patient remained afebrile.
.
# MENTAL STATUS CHANGE: Patient presented with changes in mental
status, likely related to the onset of fever, pain, and
leukocytosis.  There is no history or evidence of trauma,
stroke, or hypoperfusion.  Mental status changes have resolved,
and patient is engaging appropriately, nodding in response to
questions.
.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: Patient has mild tenderness to palpation
diffusely in her abdomen, likely chronic in nature.  On her last
admission she had abdominal pain, and two CTs of the abdomen and
pelvis were negative for obstruction.  Her LFTs were
unremarkable, and C diff was negative on two cultures.  Skin
breakdown around her ostomy site was noted and thought to be
contributing to her pain.  She had been started on Reglan with
the thought that gastric motility and PPI increased to [**Hospital1 **] for
gastroesophageal reflux disease. On this admission, CT shows
gallstones in neck and some sludge, but no elevation in biliary
or liver labs to indicate obstruction.  Pelvic exam was
negative, with positive cultures for yeast and she was given one
dose of fluconazole.  Transvaginal US was negative. No changes
in ostomy output.  She initially continued to groan and endorse
abdominal pain, with diffuse mild tenderness to palpation
throughout abdomen.  On [**2195-3-21**] she was much more comfortable
and had stopped groaning.  On [**2195-3-23**] she no longer complained
of abdominal pain.
.
# HEEL AND TOE WOUNDS: Patient has erythematous patch on back of
right ankle, consistent with stage 1 ulcer.  Podiatry was
consulted and recommended cleaning with bacitracin dressings.
ID was concerned for right first metacarpal toe lesion, so
ordered toe scan, as above, which showed focal area of
osteopenia; no MRI was thought necessary. The patient should
follow up with podiatry as an outpatient in about two weeks
after discharge.
.
# MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: We contineudthe patient's usual outpatient
neurologic medications including valproic acid, copaxone and
baclofen.
.
# DEPRESSION: Patient has depression at baseline. We continued
her home dose of Amitriptyline without event.
.
# FEN: At baseline, patient is fed through g-tube s/p colectomy
[**11-7**].  She was aggressively rehydrated in the ED and had stable
systolic blood pressures in the 110-120s.  We continued her
usual tube feeds of Probalance full strength at 55cc/hr. She is
otherwise NPO. We continued her calcium and vitamin D as well as
her daily multivitamin.
.
# ACCESS: L PICC placed on day of discharge. This should be
pulled immediately after last dose of vancomycin is finished.
.
# CODE: Confirmed DNR/DNI status.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the preoperative holding area, the
patient was noted to have an increased swelling in her leg
with 4+ pitting edema relatively equal bilaterally.  She was
also noted to have a 1+ posterior tibial pulse bilaterally.
She had no rash and no pain on palpation of her posterior
leg.  In addition, she was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
She had a regular rate and rhythm and her abdomen was soft
with slight right lower quadrant tenderness but nondistended.
The patient reported that the swelling had increased over the
last 24 hours.  It was decided to take her to the operating
room for her restorative proctocolectomy.

On [**2181-12-25**], the patient underwent a proctocolectomy and
diverting ileostomy.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well; please see dictated operative note for further details.
Postoperatively the patient was placed on cefazolin and
Flagyl perioperatively.  She was notably tachycardic with a
heart rate of 122 and it ranged from 120 to 130 but she
complained of no shortness of breath or chest pain.  Her
blood pressure was 112/84 and she had good urine output of
295 cc over two hours.  The patient had a JP drain placed
intraoperatively which put out 150 cc of serosanguineous
fluids.

An EKG was obtained which showed sinus tachycardia at 130
beats-per-minute with no ischemic changes and normal access
and progression.  As the patient was in pain that she rated 6
out of 10, it was thought that her tachycardia was most
likely secondary to this pain.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to be in pain
that she rated 8 out of 10 that was located deep in her right
lower quadrant.  She had no chest pain, no shortness of
breath, or other complaints.  Her heart rate continued to be
elevated in the range of 127 to 134 with a blood pressure of
112/70.  She produced 280 cc of urine output over eight hours
and she was still thought to have tachycardia secondary to
her pain.  Her morphine PCA was adjusted.  However, she was
also noted to have 3+ pitting edema bilaterally in her lower
extremities but no tenderness. A lower extremity ultrasound
was therefore obtained to rule out DVTs.

The ultrasound showed on the right noncompressibility of the
popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins consistent
with DVTs.  There were no DVTs noted on the left.  The
patient was therefore begun on a heparin drip and her PTT was
measured serially and the drip was adjusted to maintain the
PTT in the range of 60 to 80.

On the morning of postoperative day two, the patient
consented to be tachycardic and had an oxygen saturation of
91 to 95% on a 40% face mask.  Her urine output was good and
based on the Doppler ultrasound it was assumed that the
patient had a pulmonary embolus leading to her tachycardia
and poor oxygen saturations.  To verify this, a chest CTA was
obtained.

It showed multiple filling defects in essentially all of the
lobar pulmonary arteries consistent with extensive pulmonary
embolus.  However, the central, main, and right and left
pulmonary arteries were free of thrombus.

On postoperative day two, the patient's pain was decreased
with only mild incisional tenderness on her morphine PCA.
The patient was placed on a higher dose of steroids
surrounding her operation which were subsequently tapered to
her preoperative steroid dose over three to four days
postoperatively.

On the evening of postoperative day two, the patient was
noted to have a change in mental status.  She was arousable
and responsive but could not remember where she was or why
she was here.  She also could not stay awake and would fall
asleep in the middle of questions.  Because of the patient's
bilateral pulmonary emboli and her change in mental status,
it was decided to send her to the Intensive Care Unit for
closer monitoring and to do a mental status work-up.

The patient received a chest x-ray, an arterial blood gas, an
EKG, a complete set of lytes.  The patient also was ruled out
for a MI with cardiac enzymes.  Ultimately, there was no
source found for her change in mental status.  Her mental
status slowly cleared over the course of the next two days
and she was transferred back to the floor.  However, she
received 2 U of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit that
reached a low of 24.9 on postoperative day three.  The
patient continued on her heparin drip with a goal PT in the
range of 60 to 80.

On postoperative day five, the patient was started on a sip
diet which was slowly advanced over the next several days.
The patient was also started on low-pressor for her
continuing tachycardia that ranged up into the 120s and blood
pressure that ranged up into the 150s to 160s.

On postoperative day six, the patient's JP output began to
increase and was notably sanguinous.  Hematocrit was drawn
and remained in the range of 29 to 30 however, on
postoperative day seven, the patient's hematocrit reached a
low of 26.8 and she was consequently transfused with 2 U of
packed red blood cells bringing her hematocrit up to 32.3.
Because of the patient's apparent rebleeding
intraabdominally, it was decided to try to place [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**]
filter in her inferior vena cava.

The consult was obtained however the cardiac catheterization
laboratory was unable to place the filter secondary to a
sclerotic inferior vena cava below the renal vein with a
non-mobile thrombus in the lower aspect of the inferior vena
cava just below the renal veins.  The patient was noted to
have extensive collaterals in the pelvis and the findings
suggested a recanalized clot in the inferior vena cava.  It
was suggested that the patient receive a MRV to definitively
diagnose the patient's condition.  Because of the inability
to place the [**Location (un) 260**] filter, the patient was continued on
her heparin drip and her hematocrit and JP output were
closely monitored.  The patient however did not require any
further transfusions and her JP was pulled out on
postoperative day nine.  Also on postoperative day nine, the
patient was started on Coumadin in an attempt to transition
her to Coumadin for discharge.  Her INR over the course of
the next several days rose to a super-therapeutic level of
4.1 despite lower and lower doses of Coumadin.  Her heparin
drip was stopped and while the patient was eating, drinking,
walking, and her pain was well-controlled, she was kept
in-house until her PTT level was brought into the therapeutic
range.  This was achieved on postoperative day fifteen when
the patient's PTT level fell to 2.6.

In the intervening period, the only other significant finding
was that the ostomy was somewhat retracted as some of the
lower sutures had pulled out.  The plan was to follow the
retraction of the ostomy as an outpatient.

Also of note, the patient had burning on urination several
days prior to her discharge.  A urinalysis and a urine
culture was obtained which showed a proteus infection
sensitive to levofloxacin.  The patient was therefore started
on a five-day-course of levofloxacin to be completed as an
outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**] was admitted to the Purple Surgery service under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was on Ciprofloxacin and Ancef
for her pouchitis and wound infection.  Her cellulitis, however,
did not improve with IV antibiotics and she was taken the OR on
HD #7.  She underwent an ex-lap,mesh removal, and primary repair
of her incisional hernia.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) **] Operative
Note for detail.

She did well with wet-to-dry dressing changes until POD #3, when
she was noted to have bilious drainage and staining of her
dressings.  Over the course of the night, however, Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**]
became acutely agitated and confused.  A CT head revealed no
acute bleed; CT abd/pelvis was unremarkable for an acute bleed.
Ms. [**Known lastname 95657**] lab work showed hypernatermia with a sodium in
the 150s and acute renal failure with a  creatinine 2.5 Given
her prior history of multiple sclerosis, the Neurology team was
asked to also evaluate the patient.  In addition, given her
history of adrenal insufficiency the Endocrinology team
evaluated Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**] for her mental status change as well. EEG
showed non-specific slow and disorganized background.  An MR
brain on POD #8 revealed no new abnormalities when compared to
her OSH films.

Her agitation and mental status were closely followed by all
involved teams.  Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**] had a PICC placed for TPN, given
her enterocutaneous fistula, which was eventually discontinued
on POD #6. On POD #6, she was noted to have some gurgling and
increased agitation.  She was transferred to the SICU for closer
monitoring given airway concerns.  In the ICU her sodium levels
continued to decline and her creatinine leves came down.  On POD
#8, Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**] had a markedly improved mental status, A+Ox3
with minimal agitation.  She was transferred to the floor.

She continue to improve.  No further bilious staining was noted
during any of her dressing changes and the fistula was thought
to have closed.  A VAC dressing was placed on POD #12.

At the time of discharge on POD#16, Ms. [**Known lastname 95655**] was A+Ox3, had
good pain control, the VAC dressing was in place, and had good
control of her spasms.  She was discharged home with services in
stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL:

Mr. [**Known lastname 98193**] is a 66 y.o. man with a history significant for
longstanding etoh abuse with past episodes of DTs; relapsing MS
x30 years, wheelchair-bound with a neurogenic bladder and
history of multi-drug resistant urinary tract infections. More
recently, Mr. [**Known lastname 98193**] has presented to the [**Hospital1 **] ED three times in
the past month, twice admitted for treatment of withdrawal via
CIWA scale benzodiazepene administration. The most recent
admission was on [**7-24**], and at that time he was evaluated by
psychiatry who felt that his symptoms were also consistent with
considerable anxiety. He was discharged home on [**2130-7-31**] with
antibiotics for E. coli urinary tract infection.

On [**8-13**] he presented again to the ED complaining of
tremulousness, racing heartbeat, flushing, and diaphoresis. By
report in the ED he also had some auditory hallucinations. He
was given klonopin 1mg and valium 1mg. Subsequent tox screen was
negative for etoh, positive for benzos only. CIWA scale was 30+.
On admission to the floor he had two episodes of ??????shaking??????
described by the sitter. He remained conscious and oriented
during these episodes, which the sitter described as general
shaking of his arms and legs. These episodes were presumed to be
seizures and treated with a total of 40mg of IV valium, 10 mg of
po valium with a CIWA scale persistently >25. His exam has been
otherwise benign on the floor, VSS without fevers, tachycardia
~100s.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued monitoring.

Patient did well and was returned to the floor and required no
further benzodiazepines per CIWA score <10 by [**2130-8-14**].  He
remained sleepy for several days due to the long half-life and
large quantity of benzodiazepines administered to treat alcohol
withdrawal.

As patient's mental status improved, he strongly endorsed a
desire for rehabilitation and interest in quitting drinking.  He
was very interested in seeking institutional rehabilitation.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION:

On [**2130-8-13**], patient complained of ""bladder spasms"" which he
stated was consistent with previous episodes of urinary tract
infections.  Urinalysis at the time revealed
bacteria and white cells in urine.  Patient was treated with
ceftriaxone and then switched to cephalexin PO in anticipation
of discharge to continue treatment as outpatient.

EPISODE OF UNRESPONSIVENESS:

On hospital day 5, patient was found by nursing staff to be
unresponsive, with ""pinpoint pupils"".  Patient was given Narcan
with good effect, and patient was roused for several minutes,
but urine toxicology revealed no evidence of narcotics (only
positive for benzodiazepines).  Patient was transferred to the
ICU for frequent neuro checks overnight, although patient had no
loss of bowel continence and no evidence of mucous membrane or
tongue trauma.  Patient was deemed stable on hospital day 6 and
returned to the floor.  EEG revealed changes consistent with
mild toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  Neuro consult did not feel
that the episode was consistent with a seizure, as again,
patient stated that he remembered the episode and was conscious
for the entire duration of the event (but could not respond).
Neuro will follow patient in ten days following discharge.

PARAPHIMOSIS:

On hospital day 7, patient was noted to have significant edema
of the foreskin, consistent with paraphimosis without ischemia.
The foreskin was easily reduced and edema was treated with
compression and ice with good effect.  However, on hospital day
9, patient was found to have purulent urethral discharge
(negative urinalysis) and caking on the glans underneath the
foreskin.  Discharge was sent for gram stain and culture
(including yeast and fungus), and will be followed up after
discharge.  Patient was restarted on Keflex for 7 days along
with a miconazole topical powder for empiric treatment of the
discharge.

DISPOSITION:

Patient was very interested in institutional alcoholic
rehabilitation throughout his hospital stay and felt very
strongly that he could not continue in this pattern of recurrent
abuse and withdrawal.  Patient was deemed to be stable for
discharge on hospital day 9.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98193**] is a 68 yo male with h/o of MS, depression, HTN,
neurogenic bladder s/p multiple UTIs who presents after an
episode of hypoxia. Pt was lethargic and not answering questions
so hx was obtained from notes. Per NH notes pt had increasing
dyspnea for several days and was found to have a LLL PNA three
days ago. He had been treated with Rocephin (1gm IM x 3 doses)
for 3 days. Today at the nursing home his O2 sats dropped to 79%
on 2L NC (baseline on 2L NC) and increased to 86-88% on 5L NC
02. He was noted to be very congested and received nebs. At that
time his SBPs were noted to be in the upper 70s to 80s with HR
in the 90s and his temperature was 98. He was also more
lethargic than usual. At baseline he answers questions promptly
but was very slow to respond this morning. EMS was called and he
was brought to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ER his rectal temperature was 100.1. He was given flagyl,
levaquin, vancomycin and decadron 10 mg. His BP was initially
86/44 with a HR of 51 and improved to 102/48 after 2L of NS. His
sats were up to 100% on a NRB. He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] his SBPs were in the low 100s and HR in
the 70s. Sats continued to be 100% on NRB. He denied chest pain,
SOB, abd pain or diarrhea. ABG was checked and was
7.25/63/107/29. His initial DNR/DNI status was confirmed with
his HCP, his [**Name2 (NI) 802**], but it was agreed he could start NIPPV. He
was started on CPAP of [**5-9**].

AP CHEST:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting position demonstrates now a diffuse density overlying
the left lower lung field and obliterating the diaphragmatic
contour. The left lateral pleural sinus appears somewhat
blunted. On the right side, the pulmonary lung fields
demonstrate normal vasculature without evidence of CHF and the
right lateral pleural sinus is free. The heart may be mildly
enlarged and the thoracic aorta is moderately widened and
elongated but not excessive for age.
Available for comparison are multiple previous chest
examinations from [**2130**] and [**2129**]. The now present density in the
left lung base did not exist on previous examinations.
IMPRESSION: Portable AP chest view demonstrates parenchymal
infiltrate in left lower lobe area with possible pleural
reaction. No evidence of CHF.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: This examination is limited by patient motion. There
is no evidence for hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally
midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci,
which are stable since the prior exam and may be secondary to
age-related involutional change. Also, stable periventricular
white matter hypodensity, which may be secondary to chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. The surrounding osseous
structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute intracranial abnormality
including hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
KUB
FINDINGS: Two supine radiographs are reviewed. Evaluation is
limited secondary to body habitus. Multiple air-filled bowel
loops are identified that are presumed large bowel. There is no
definite evidence for dilated small bowel loops. Note of
prostate seeds.
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation, but no definite evidence for
obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia:  Patient was on rocephin at the nursing home x 3
days without improvement.  He was admitted to ICU for
noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and antibiotics were
expanded to vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin.  Patient has
steadily improved and now is stable on room air and remains
afebrile.  Given sputum results, plan to continue vancomycin x
14 days and patient will also complete a 14 day course of
levofloxacin for treatment of his pneumonia.  He received chest
PT while in house but is currently coughing up his sputum well.
He is on scheduled nebs to optimize his airways in the setting
of his resolving pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient's blood pressure low on admission but
improved with IVF boluses.  He did not require pressors and has
remained hemodynamically stable for days without additional
boluses.  Cortrysn stim test in the ICU showed an appropriate
response.
.
# Altered mental status:  Patient was lethargic on admission.
Head CT was unremarkable and mental status improved considerably
with treatment of his pneumonia.  TSH, folate, B12, RPR, and
TFTs were all unremarkable.
.
# MS: Per [**Year (4 digits) 802**], patient is too weak to walk at baseline.
Recommend reevaluation at nursing home for modified wheelchair
to improve mobility.  He was continued on his home doses of
baclofen and neurontin.
.
# Depression: Mood stable.  Patient continued on his home
trazodone + celexa.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit stable.  Patient continued on his home
iron.
.
# HTN: Patient continued on his home beta blocker in house.
Plan to restart norvasc at the nursing home.
.
# FEN: While in house, patient had a swallow evaluation to rule
out overt aspiration.  No overt aspiration on bedside
evaluation.  Patient is on a ground diet with thin liquids.
Recommend all his meds be administered in pureed form.
.
# PPX: home PPI, SQ heparin, wound consult was obtained for
wound care
.
# DNR/DNI
.
# Dispo: patient discharged back to his nursing home

Chief Complaint:
unresponsive at skilled nursing facility

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with history of MS, neurogenic bladder with
suprapubic catheter and multiple drug resistant UTIs, with
recent admission for MRSA PNA, who presented with hypoxia and
unresponsiveness at nursing home requiring ICU admission for
sepsis, now transferred to medical floor. He was recently
admitted from [**10-28**] - [**2132-11-6**] with the same presentation, at
which time he was found to have a LLL infiltrate with sputum
culture growing MRSA. He was treated briefly with positive
pressure ventilation with improvement, and discharged back to
the nursing home with a PICC, to complete a 14 day course of
vancomycin and levofloxacin which would have finished on [**11-20**].
However, the patient was readmitted from [**11-15**] - [**2132-11-17**] when
his PICC line came out. He had the PICC line replaced by IR on
[**11-17**], and was discharged with orders to continue vancomycin
with end date as previously scheduled, as well as a 7 day course
of ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for reasons that are unclear. Of
note, during this admission his creatinine was noted to be
elevated; urine lytes were not consistent with a pre-renal
etiology, it did not improve with hydration, and a renal
ultrasound was unrevealing. They did not investigate this
further, and discharged him with creatinine 1.5.
.
Per report, the patient was doing alright at the nursing home
until this morning when he was found to have an O2 sat of 86% on
RA, and unresponsive.
.
On arrival to the ED, T 101.8, HR 70s, BP 110/80 but with
occasional drops to the 80s systolic, 96-97% on NRB. He received
2 liters of IVF with eventual urine output, although initally
was anuric. Labs were notable for acute renal failure with
creatinine 2.5, up from 1.5 last week. He was given a dose of
linezolid and zosyn. DNR/DNI status was confirmed.


Past Medical History:
# Recent MRSA pneumonia ([**10/2132**])
# Progressive, relapsing, multiple sclerosis for the last 30
years. The patient is treated with monthly steroids, Solu-Medrol
and Avonex.
# Prostate cancer status post brachytherapy.
# Depression with multiple admissions in the past and history of
overdose of isopropyl alcohol.
# Neurogenic bladder with recurrent urinary tract infections.
The patient has a suprapubic foley.
# History of right elbow bursitis with MRSA.
# Hypertension.
# Chronic lower back pain with cervical and lumbar spinal
stenosis.
# Osteoarthritis.
# Impotence with penile prosthesis.
# Chronic polyps.
# History of peptic ulcer disease with upper GI bleed in the
setting of chronic NSAIDs use.
# History of alcohol abuse with history of generalized tonic
clonic seizures in the setting of alcohol (see neuro note
written in [**2130-3-6**]).
# Pemphigus


Social History:
Lives in [**Location **]. Denies alcohol or tobacco. [**Location **] involved in his

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 96.9, 80, 132/86, 20, 99% on 2l NC
GENERAL: Obese caucasian male, responds to questions
intermittently
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes.
NECK: Unable to locate JVP.
COR: nl rate, S1S2, no gmr
LUNGS: coarse BS anteriorly
ABDOMEN: obese abdomen, firm, +BS, unable to assess HSM.
PELVIS: Suprapubic catheter in place with surrounding bandage.
EXTR: 1+ non-pitting edema.


Pertinent Results:
PORTABLE AP: Heterogeneous opacification at the left lung base
is largely atelectasis, explaining the elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm. Right lung is low in volume but grossly clear.
Heart is not enlarged. Right PIC catheter tip projects over the
junction of the brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax.
.
CT HEAD: Bifrontal periventricular white matter hypodensities
unchanged from before. No hemorrhage.
.
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: A moderate to large amount
of foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the deep central,
pericallosal, and periventricular white matter compatible with
multiple sclerosis plaques are essentially stable when compared
to [**2129-9-15**]. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles
compatible cortical atrophy is also unchanged. Post- gadolinium
administration, no areas of abnormal enhancement are identified
to suggest acute demyelination. Within the left frontal region,
a linear area of contrast enhancement is more compatible with a
developmental venous anomaly, rather than an enhancement of a
demyelinating plaque.

Within the region of the medullary pyramids, there is increased
T2-weighted signal, which is not well visualized on the previous
MRI. There is no abnormal enhancement or diffusion-weighted
imaging abnormality in this region. There is no evidence of
abnormal mass, shift of normally midline structures, or edema.

IMPRESSION: Aside from regions within the medullary pyramids of
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, areas of demyelination compatible with
multiple sclerosis are unchanged dating back to [**2129-9-15**]. Thus, this medullary lesion could represent interval
development of an additional area of demyelination. No areas of
abnormal enhancement identified to indicate acute demyelination.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with MS, neurogenic bladder with suprapubic
catheter and multiple drug resistant UTIs, with recent admission
for MRSA PNA, who presented unresponsive possibly secondary to
infection.
.
# mental status change: had been alert enough to elope from
nursing home during the week prior to this hospitalization but
transferred here because minimally responsive. Head MRI showed
new focus of demyelination in the medulla, other areas of
demyelination essentially unchanged from [**2129**]; it is not clear
if this new medullary demyelination is contributing to current
symtpoms. Likely multifactorial, from hypercarbia, methadone use
in setting of decreasing renal function, and infection in
addition to MS. Improved with BiPAP in ICU, consistent with
combination of hypoxia and hypercarbia. Appreciate sleep
consult; will continue BiPAP 12/8 with back up rate 8 and 2L O2
flow by. Has recovered/woken up to what seems to be baseline
mental status, will continue to monitor. Avoiding all narcotis
and benzodiazepines.
.
# Recurrent PNA: recently treated with full course of vancomycin
for MRSA pneumonia with improvement of infiltrate on CXR.
However, febrile on admission and sputum did grow Proteus and
MRSA, so continuing with ceftriaxone and vancomycin through
[**2132-12-3**] as recommended by ID consult.
.
# Acute renal failure: Improving gradually from Cr 2.5 on
admission to 1.6, with good diuresis after lasix, probably also
autodiuresis.
.
# MS: Continue baclofen and gabapentin. PT/OT for LE
contractures
.
# Neurogenic bladder/autonomic instability?: Autonomic
instability causing labile blood pressures. Continue oxybutinin.

.
# Depression: Continue celexa and duloxetine.
.
# Microcytic Anemia: Cont iron. He does have a history of
esophagitis on EGD in [**2131**]. We have scheduled repeat EGD as
outpatient.
.
# HTN: BP trending up after sepsis resolved. Have added back
metoprolol, titrate up to 50mg tid and resumed home amlodipine
5mg daily.
.
# Decubitus ulcers: Wound care for pressure ulcers
.
# PPX: Continue PPI, SQ heparin, bowel regimen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99500**] is a 62 year old gentleman with multiple sclerosis,
seizure disorder, dementia, with chronic indwelling foley foley
and multiple UTI's who presents with fever, seizure, bandemia,
and hypotension.
.
1) Sepsis:  In MICU, BP and urine output were low-normal but
responsive to fluids.  Initial assessment was that the patient
septic secondary to UTI and developed febrile seizures.  Urine
culture was unrevealing due to contaminant and previous
antibiotics administered at nursing home.  Given his history of
ESBL klebsiella UTI and long-term residence at a skilled nursing
facility, he was treated with with Meropenem and [**Known lastname **].
His foley was replaced.  He became afebrile, and his bandemia
resolved and he had no further seizure activity.  Presumably his
presentation was secondary to [**Known lastname 27285**] tract infection in the
setting of chronic foley. Patient hemodynamically normalized on
HD 2. Mental status returned to baseline at that point, and
urine output improved.  On [**5-13**], he was transferred from the ICU
to the medical service.  His historical micro data was reviewed,
and given no prior history of MRSA in urine cultures, [**Month/Year (2) **]
was discontinued.  He was discharged with a plan to complete a
14-day course of Meropenem (day 1=[**5-11**], day 14 [**5-24**]).
.
2) Seizures:  Seizure threshold likely was lowered in the
setting of fevers, sepsis, hyponatremia. He was evaluated by
Neurology and loaded with Dilantin following arrival to ICU. He
had no further seizure activity while inpatient. Per Neurology
recommendations, Dilantin and Carbamazepine doses were modified
according to following goal levels:
Dilantin (corrected) level: [**9-9**]
Carbamazepine level: [**4-6**]
.
3) Hyponatremia: Serum sodium level was 129 on admisssion,
likely a reflection of hypovolemia.  This corrected with fluid
resuscitation.
.
4) Skin breakdown: Patient with stage I breakdown over dorsal
surfaces of feet and isolated spots at bony prominences.  A
wound care consult was obtained, and recommendations were
implemented as follows:
Support surface  - Atmos Air mattress
Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
Heels off bed surface at all times
Waffle Boots BLE's
If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a
pressure relief cushion.
Moisturize B/L LE's and feet [**Hospital1 **].
Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse
all open wounds.
Pat the tissue dry with dry gauze.
Apply moisture barrier ointment(Criti-Aid Clear) to bilateral
dorsum of feet [**Hospital1 **].
.
5) Hyperglycemia: Patient was noted to be hyperglycemic in the
setting of sepsis and was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale.
 Question of diabetes was raised; however, A1c was 5.2.
.
6) MS: no medications, no active issues.
.
7) Pain control: continued outpatient regimen of baclofen and
oxycodone.
.
8) Ppx: Hep SC, PPI, bowel regimen.
.
9) Access: Right IJ was placed per the sepsis protocol in the ED
and later discontinued prior to transfer from MICU.  PICC
attempt unsuccessful at bedside, and Interventional Radiology
was consulted for PICC placement prior to discharge.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 99500**] is a 62 year old gentleman with history of multiple
sclerosis, [**Known lastname 862**] disorder, dementia, and chronic indwelling
foley with recurrent UTIs (including ESBL klebsiella) presented
from his nursing home with altered mental status.  In
communication with his PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], the patient's
baseline mental status is alert and talkative(occasionally
rambling), but he became lethargic and somnolent beginning the
day prior to admission at the nursing home.  He reportedly had a
U/A and culture sent 3 days prior to admission which revealed
VRE (reportedly only sensitive to macrodantin) and proteus.  His
nurse practitioner felt he was likely colonized with VRE and
proteus was sensitive to ampicillin, thus he was started on
ampicillin at that time.  At that time, he was also felt to be
fecally obstructed, so he was given a fleets enema to which he
responded well.  On the evening prior to admission, in addition
to his change in mental status, he was found to be tachycardic
to the low 100s.  He was, however, afebrile and systolic blood
pressures were consistently in the 100s-120s.  His mental status
declined overnight at the nursing home and he was transferred to
the ED for further evaluation and management.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals revealed: HR 107 BP 98/28 RR 14
O2sat 100%on NRB-->RA; no temperature was recorded.  He was
noted to have abdominal discomfort and suprapubic fullness.  His
foley was found to be obstructed and when resolved, was noted to
drain frank pus from his bladder.  Labs demonstrated WBC count
of 27 with 16% bandemia and an elevated lactate to 10.5 which
decreased to 8.6 with IV fluids.  A CT abd/pelvis was obtained
to rule out bowel ischemia and surgery was consulted.  CT
abd/pelvis did not reveal ischemia of the gut, but did note
thickening of perirectal and sigmoid wall believed consistent
with chronic laxative use vs. infectious/inflammatory etiology.
A CXR showed a retrocardiac opacity thought to represent
atelectasis vs. consolidation.  Blood and urine cultures were
sent and he received vanco/levofloxacin/flagyl.  Given his
altered mental status, a head CT was obtained which was negative
for hemorrhage and mass effect.
.
Although it is not clearly documented, he reportedly received 7L
NS IV fluid resuscitation.  His ED course was complicated by
multiple attempts at central venous access and he was initially
started on peripheral dopamine to maintain his blood pressure.
A right IJ was then placed and MAPs remained in the low 50s so
levophed was started in addition to dopamine prior to his
transfer to the ICU.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain secondary to altered mental status.

IMAGING:
Head CT [**6-25**]: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
significant change compared to CT of [**2171-5-12**] with multiple
chronic findings as described above. 2. Soft tissue density
material within the external auditory canals bilaterally, most
likely cerumen. Correlation with physical exam is recommended.
.
Portable abdomen [**6-25**]: 1. Marked gastric distention. Dilated
nonspecified loops of bowel. Obstruction cannot be excluded. 2.
Suggestion of markedly distended bladder.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-25**]: Detailed evaluation of the
intra-abdominal and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack
of intravenous contrast administration and artifact secondary to
patient arm positioning.
1. No acute intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic pathology.
2. Thickening of the rectal and sigmoid walls may be secondary
to chronic use of laxatives. Infectious proctitis and
inflammatory bowel disease also remain in the differential
diagnosis. Vascular etiologies are considered less likely. If
abdominal symptoms persist, consider follow up exam with oral
and IV contrast.
3. Mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Small bladder diverticulum.
4. Diffuse osteopenia with contiguous compression fractures of
the thoracic and lumbar spine as described above of, age
indeterminate, but overall chronic in appearance.
5. Right femoral head subchondral sclerotic line could represent
a stress fracture versus early avascular necrosis.
.
portable CXR [**6-25**]: 1. Right internal jugular central venous line
tip likely terminates in the cavo-atrial junction. 2. Increased
left retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or
consolidation.
portable CXR [**6-26**]: Cardiac silhouette is obscured and is probably
at the upper limits of normal in size. Bibasilar atelectasis and
possible small effusion. No vascular congestion and I doubt the
presence of consolidations. Tip of the right IJ line lies in the
right atrium. Allowing for technical differences, there is
little change from exam 24 hours ago, including the IJ line
placement. Tip of NG tube in stomach.
.
EKG [**6-25**] 2:29 am: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads.  Diffuse T wave flattening which is
non-specific. Compared to tracing of [**2171-5-12**] significant sinus
tachycardia is new. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
132 118 92 322/400 56 56 57
EKG [**6-25**] 12:29 pm: Sinus tachycardia with slight ST segment
elevations in leads I and aVL. New T wave inversion in leads
V1-V4 with ST-T wave flattening in leads V5-V6. These findings
are consistent with acute anterolateral ischemic process.
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc    P QRS T

WBC scan - Decision:

Following the injection of autologous white blood cells labeled
with In-111,
images of the whole body were obtained.

These images show no abnormal foci of tracer accumulation.
The above findings are consistent with no radiologic evidence of
any fever
focus.

However, the sensitivity of the study for detection of occult
infection is
decreased by prolonged antibiotic use.

IMPRESSION: No radiologic evidence of any focal fever source
with limitations as
noted above.

PICC change - IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a previously
placed PICC line over the wire with a new placement of 35 cm
double-lumen line PICC line with tip in the distal part of the
SVC. The line is ready for use.

CXR [**7-22**] - Lung volumes remain quite low. Subsegmental
atelectasis in the left mid lung is unchanged since [**7-16**],
new since [**7-8**]. Upper lungs clear. No pneumonia or
pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusion may be
present. Heart size normal. Tip of the right PIC catheter
projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.

UPEP - pending

Rib XR- IMPRESSION:
1. Several old healed rib fractures on the right lower inferior
rib cage. The right sixth rib laterally may be acute.
2. A biliary drain identified.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis at the lung
bases.

LENI bilaterally - CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT.

CT [**2171-7-14**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and
great vessels are unremarkable. There is no pericardial
effusion. No pulmonary nodules or opacities are identified.
There are small, bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis which are overall unchanged in appearance compared
to [**2171-7-3**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post
cholecystostomy with a pigtail drain coiled within the
gallbladder fossa in good position. The gallbladder itself is
overall decompressed. There is no evidence of intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The liver is normal in
appearance without focal lesion. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal
glands, stomach and abdominal portions of the large and small
bowel are unremarkable. A small, 3-mm low-attenuation lesion
within the mid pole of the left kidney is too small to
characterize but likely represents a simple renal cyst (2:59).
There are a few, sub 5-mm low-attenuation lesions within the
right kidney which are also too small to characterize but likely
represent simple cysts. There is no free air or free fluid
within the abdomen. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes identified. There are few prominent
mesenteric lymph nodes present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is mild wall thickening
of the rectum and sigmoid colon which overall is improved in
appearance compared to the previous examination. A Foley balloon
is present within the bladder which is relatively decompressed.
The bladder wall is mildly thickened and this is also unchanged
compared to the previous evaluation. There is no free fluid in
the pelvis. There are no pathologically enlarged inguinal or
pelvic lymph nodes.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Diffuse osteopenia is unchanged. Old
fractures of the right superior and inferior pubic rami are also
unchanged. Contiguous compression fractures of the entire
thoracolumbar spine are present and unchanged. There are no
suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Status post cholecystostomy with pigtail drain placed within
the gallbladder fossa in good position. No intraabdominal fluid
collections.

2. Stable appearance of bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent
atelectasis.

GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP; GUIDANCE PERC TRANS BIL DRAINA

Reason: Place a cholecystostomy tube

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man with HIDA scan positive for cholecystitis. Poor
surgical candidate for GB removal and fevers despite antibiotics

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Place a cholecystostomy tube
INDICATION: Acute cholecystitis on HIDA scan. Poor surgical
candidate.

COMPARISON: HIDA, [**2171-7-9**].

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: A prominent dilated gallbladder with a few
intraluminal shadowing stones is appreciated. After explaining
the risks and benefits of the procedure, informed written
consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the table
and a timeout was performed to confirm patient name, location,
and procedure. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
Under constant ultrasound guidance, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4300**] needle was
percutaneously placed into the gallbladder. An 8 French dilator
was used and an 8 French pigtail catheter was subsequently
threaded into the gallbladder lumen. 100 cc of dark bile was
aspirated and sent for culture.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications. Mild sedation was used including 25 mcg of
Fentanyl IV. The attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], was present and
performed the entire procedure.

Post-procedure orders were placed in CareWeb.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided drainage and catheter
placement within gallbladder.

ECHO - Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg.
Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function
are normal (LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.

PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2171-7-8**].

COMPARISON: [**2171-7-2**].

INDICATION: Fever.

New right PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
Worsening bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are present, probably
related to atelectasis, although underlying infectious process
is not excluded. Small pleural effusions, right greater than
left, are not substantially changed.

MRI L, T spine - IMPRESSION: No evidence of spondylodiscitis or
epidural or paraspinal abscesses of the thoracolumbar spine.

Degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine without canal
stenosis.

Partially imaged are degenerative changes of the cervical spine
with likely mild-to-moderate canal stenosis at the C3/4 and C4/5
levels.

Large right pleural effusion.

RIGHT FEMUR ON [**7-6**]

HISTORY: Fever. Possible AVN.

Five views of the upper and lower femur show no abnormality of
the femoral head, neck, trochanteric region are normal. There is
some demineralization of the mid shaft and heterogeneous
mineralization of the condyles of the femur and possibly tibial
plateau. I would recommend routine views of the knee for better
characterization.

KUB [**2171-6-25**] - IMPRESSION:

1. Marked gastric distention. Dilated nonspecified loops of
bowel. Obstruction cannot be excluded.

2. Suggestion of markedly distended bladder.

CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change
compared to CT of [**2171-5-12**] with multiple chronic findings as
described above.

2. Soft tissue density material within the external auditory
canals bilaterally, most likely cerumen. Correlation with
physical exam is recommended.

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2171-7-24**]):    No significant growth.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Urosepsis - ICU course: On presentation the patient met
criteria for SIRS and sepsis: WBC of 27, tachycardic and a
source of infection, thought to be most likely urosepsis given
frank pus drainage from the bladder, history of recurrent
infections and his foley found to be obstructed. In review of
past culture data, UTIs in the past have grown pansensitive E.
Coli and ESBL resistant klebsiella previously sensitive to
meropenem, imipenem, zosyn. Per nursing home report, urine
cultures from 3 days PTA grew VRE (sensitivities unknown) and
proteus. He has also had multiple wound swabs that revealed MRSA
and pseudomonas, thus, it was thought also reasonable to
initially cover for MRSA. His wounds, however, do not appear to
be infected and were thought unlikely to be a contributing
source of sepsis. The CT of the abdomen did not appear
consistent with bowel ischemia, but the patient was initially
started on flagyl given colonic thickening. Upon arrival to the
ICU, his CVP initially was [**7-4**], on a dopamine, levophed and
vasopressin drip. A cortisol stimulation test was negative for
adrenal suppression. With input from ID, the patient was started
on meropenem and daptomycin and flagyl was continued. We were
able to wean the dopamine to off on day 1 in the ICU, and
levophed and vasopressin were weaned on day 2. CVP was
maintained between [**7-5**] with 500cc LR boluses on day 3, and the
patient did not require additional boluses on day 4. By day 4 he
was assessed as stable, recovering from the septic picture, and
fit to be called out to the floor. Blood cultures grew GNRs
which were identified as proteus on day 3 (sensitivities above)
([**2171-6-27**]). Based on sensitivities, IV meropenem was continued and
Daptomycin was discontinued.

On the floor, meropenem was continued. However he started having
fevers again and hence flagyl was restarted. Multiple tests done
to identify source of infection - MRI spine - no abscess or
osteomyelitis, ECHO no IE. Cultures neg. no C diff. No PICC
infection, Foley changed. ID was consulted and CT abd, HIDA done
that confirmed acute cholecystitis. Surgery deemed the patient a
poor surgical candidate and hence a cholesystostomy tube was
placed by IR. Abx were changed to aztreonam. WBC scan prior to
dc was normal. Patient finally remained afebrile for > 4 days
prior to discharge. He is to complete a 2 wk course of IV
aztreonam - day 1 [**2171-7-15**]. Flagyl was stopped after about a 3 wk
course. Patient advised a follow up appointment with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 4020**] from infectious disease in 2 weeks as well as on
[**2171-7-26**] - patient should get a CBC, chem 7 for monitoring and
results to be faxed as stated below to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4020**] who will
check the results. Brief Ca work up as a fever source (PSA,
SPEP, UPEP) normal.

Acute retention of urine was resolved after foley was placed.
Patient may be advised if an SPC is desired to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in
clinic given recurrent UTIs and [**Last Name (STitle) 27285**] obstruction due to MS.

[**Last Name (STitle) **] disorder: The patient had a tonic-clonic [**Last Name (STitle) 862**] on the
first night of admission, that resolved spontaneously within 2
minutes. This was likely exacerbated by his septic state. His
phenytoin and carbamazapine levels were normal. He has been
[**Last Name (STitle) 862**]-free since then. He was maintained on his outpatient
doses of phenytoin and carbamazapine.

After a speech and swallow evaluation, his diet was advanced as
below. Regular diet per second swallow evaluation.

Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 0.4-0.9. Initial
bump in creatinine most likely was secondary to obstruction, but
also given hemoconcentration and response to fluids, appeared to
be prerenal as well. Given frank pus from bladder, ascending b/l
pyelo was a concern, but CT A/P, albeit without contrast, did
not show evidence of this. Creatinine back to baseline 2-3 days
after initiation of volume resuscitation.

Coagulopathy: INR was elevated to 1.5, then 2.2 in the absence
of blood thinning agents. Given his poor nutritional status, may
be a result of vit K deficiency, but certainly was concerning in
the setting of sepsis. Platelet count was normal. D-dimer
decreasing steadily, stable fibrinogen reassuring that DIC is
unlikely.
- INR normalized with 3 daily doses of vitamin K
.
# EKG changes: T wave inversions in septal leads most likely
reflected lead placement, but new from most recent EKG. MB index
negative x2. Ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, cardiac
ischemia was unlikely. No events were seen on tele during the
ICU stay. Patient remained CP free.
.
# Elevated LFTs: Initially the process could be related to the
sepsis. However, later he did have acute cholecystitis refer
above. LFT continued to trend down during admission. Normal at
discharge.

# Pancreatitis attributed to Ileus from MS - developed slight
elevation of lipase in setting of ileus attributed to MS.  Made
NPO for two days.  Repeat CT abdomen without evidence of
pancreatitis, but GB distension and edema with stones. Diagnosed
with cholecystitis as above. Golytely given 2 L per day for two
days with tap water enemas twice daily for two days. Ileus was
aggressively treated and resolved. No acute mech bowel
obstruction was noted.

# Facial rash consistent with fungal infection - stated
miconazole cream.

# Noted anemia and thrombocytosis both of which were stable at
discharge. Please recheck another CBC in a month to be deferred
to the PCP.

Patient has a new PICC dated [**2171-7-22**] and to complete aztreonam
as above. To make appt with IR for biliay drain removal as
below. ID, surgery to follow up.

Pertinent Results:
MANDIBLE (PA, [**Last Name (un) **] & BOTH OBLS): The right frontal sinus is
not pneumatized. No definite air-fluid level seen in the
maxillary sinuses. Several small areas of periapical lucency are
seen at the base of several mandibular teeth. The maxillary
teeth are not well evaluated on this study dedicated for the
mandible. No mandibular fracture is seen.
.
NON CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift in mass structures, or acute
major vascular territorial infarction. Central atrophy with
dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles is displayed with
no significant interval change as does periventricular white
matter hypoattenuation and scattered periventricular subcortical
white matter hypodensities, likely reflect underlying multiple
sclerosis. Soft tissues and osseous structures appear
unremarkable. There is minimal mucosal thickening within the
left posterior ethmoid air cells, unchanged probably with
cerumen within the external auditory canals bilaterally.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
Altered Mental Status/Lethargy - It was thought the pt's
lethargy and altered mental status was likely related to a
possible UTI given his history.  He was admitted on broad
spectrum antibiotic coverage, and he was given a dose of cipro
in the ED, but this was not continued on the floor.  His foley
was changed, and urine culture showed preliminary culture showed
>100K yeast, but no bacteria. Other infectious etiologies were
evaluated, such as meningitis, but pt was not febrile, WBC was
normal, and neck was supple, and pt was already on broad
spectrum abx. Other causes of altered mental status were
considered.  The pt was on several medications which could cause
altered mental status, most of which were presecribed by his
nursing home and were not on his prior discharge summary dated
[**2171-8-23**].  Specifically, his oxycodone, baclofin and ativan were
held.  The pt's electrolytes were normal, his bicarb was WNL
indicating no acute avid/base dirsorders, and tox screens were
drawn and negative.  He was not having any acute [**Month/Day/Year 862**]
activity, but his serum dilantin level was low on admission (see
below).  Head CT was negative.  Overall, pt's mental status
improved greatly after IVF and holding of the medications which
may have had CNS effects, and by [**9-19**], with pt feeling like he
was at his baseline. Pt was more oriented, was able to have a
regular conversation, and had an appropriate affect.  The
patient was also seen by his sister on the day of discharge who
felt he was closer to his baseline.

Hypotension - Pt had some episodes of hypotension in the ED for
which he was given IVF before being sent the the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was
given an additional 1L, and by [**9-18**] was able to resume a
regular ground diet.  His SBP did have some dips into the 90's
which was felt to be related to autonomic dysfunction related to
long standing MS with very little mobility, along with how the
pt was not able to eat and hydrate ad lib due to his non-mobile
state.  Nursing was notified to have fluid and nutrition by the
bedside for po intake as tolerated.

Osteomyelitis - The patient was continued on his outpatient
regimen of [**Month/Year (2) **], Flagyl, and Zosyn.  The patient was
scheduled to end antibiotics on [**9-22**] (after a 6 week course),
but discussion with ID, the decision was made to continue abx
for another 4 weeks. His Zosyn dosing was increased from q 8hrs
to q 6hrs.  He had a repeat MRI prior to discharge which will be
followed up by his infectious disease physicians.  Neurosurgery
saw the patient and felt that there was no need for surgical
intervention at this time.

Recurrent UTI - Pt's foley was changed on admission.  Prior D/C
summaries show that pt should be considered for suprapubic
catheter placement at some point.  Urine culture showed yeast
but no bacterial growth after 1 day.

[**Month/Year (2) **] Disorder - Pt did not appear to have any [**Month/Year (2) 862**]
activity based upon call to nursing home, nor did he have any in
the ED or on admission.  His dilantin level was low, even with
correction.  Prior D/C summary indicates that they had reduced
his dosing from 300 mg tid to 100 mg tid.  Pharmacy was called,
and their recomendation was to increase dosing to 200 mg tid
which was done on [**9-18**].  Levels were not checked on [**9-19**] due
to it being unlikly to have equilibrated so quickly, and should
be followed up on at the nursing home facility.

Facial Pain - Pt has history of trigeminal neuralgia and TMJ
pain.  On exam, the pt has very poor dentition, so the idea of
oral abscess or other dental conditions was considered.  Dental
consult was requested, who ordered mandibular films which showed
non-specific findings.  They otherwise found no signs of acute
abscesses on exam, and recomended panorex films when pt was
stable for transport for further evaluation.  Additionally, they
felt that extraction of 4 teeth would be needed.  Panorex films
were not obtainable as the patient was unable to maintain the
proper position.  As the patient was comfortable and denying any
pain, he was advised to follow this up as an outpatient if
necessary.

Back Pain - Pt was reporting some back pain on [**9-19**], which he
attributed to lying in bed for the past 2 days.  He states he
typically spends part of the day in his wheelchair rather than
in bed.  He states that he does not have any specialized or
electric wheelchair and that a regular chair suffices.  On the
floor, he was transferred to chair for several hours during the
day which he tolerated well.

GERD - Continued outpatient pantoprazole dose to good effect.

Decubitus Ulcers - Pt has old ulcers on his back and
extremities.  Wound care instructions were on prior D/C summary
and were continued on this admission.  No acute issues
currently.

Constipation - Continued most of the pt's outpatient bowel
regimen (Held Miralax).  From prior d/c summary, pt apparently
develops severe constipation if regimen is decreased, but he's
doing well currently.

Communication - Sister [**Doctor First Name 5627**] is HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 99552**] or
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 99553**].

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2135-11-11**]  1:48:08 PM


Baseline artifact. Probable atrial flutter with variable A-V
block, but is
difficult to assess due to baseline artifact. ST segment is
difficule to assess
due to baseline artifact. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2135-11-11**] atrial
fibrillation has converted to probable atrial flutter. Repeat
tracing is
recommended.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to patient positioning.
2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
3. Ventriculomegaly, which appears out of proportion to the
amount of cortical atrophy. Additionally, the ventricles appear
much larger than the CT of [**2130-3-15**] and the white matter
hypodensity about the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles
is more prominent, potentially relating to either progression of
small vessel disease or transependymal edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Respirtory Distress - was likely from aspiration pneumonia. Non
invasive measures were continued - antibiotics initially in ICU
with nebs. In the ICU, a discussion was done with the health
care proxy [**Name (NI) 122**] and the patient was made 'CMO"" and was sent
home with home hospice.  Antibiotic was stopped. All catheters
were remopved and the patient was made DNR/DNI. Palliative care
team was involved in care ofthe patient and for arrangement of
hospice care.

Other medical prblems include - atrial fibrillation, peptic
ulcer diease and hypertension with failure to thrive. the
patient was non-verbal and has advanced Alzheimers dementia.
Given the finding of dilated ventricles on CT head, neurology
was consulted but given the patient's poor prognostic state they
did not recommend any further evaluation for possible NPH.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50992**]  was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-3-29**] for an elective
left total ankle fusion and left great toe amputation.
Pre-operatively, he was consented, prepped, and brought to the
operating room. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any complication. Post-operatively, he was transferred
to the PACU and unit for labile blood pressure and pulse.
Urology was consulted for frank pus in urine.  Urology
recommends to continue on antibiotic for 3 weeks. He was
followed by medical staff regarding betablockers and resumed

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2116**],
PCI native left circumflex [**2124**], systolic heart failure, and
multiple sclerosis, presents with melena from [**Hospital3 **]. Of note, patient had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**2126-9-2**] to [**2126-9-4**] for elective ERCP during which he had
removal of CBD stones as well as a biliary stent placed. That
hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR.
He then presented on [**2126-11-19**] to [**Hospital6 5016**] for
additional ERCP to have his previously placed biliary stent
removed. At time of that procedure, [**Hospital3 **] ERCP team
reported some [**Hospital3 **] from around the stent at the ampulla, which
they cauterized to gain hemostasis. Patient was discharged from
[**Hospital3 **] and reports that he was not feeling like he ws back
to his baseline at any point in [**Month (only) 1096**]. This morning at 0600,
he awoke with severe mid-abdominal pain and then had urgency to
have bowel movement, which was described as ""mahagony-colored"".
He then proceeded to Holy [**Hospital 81777**] hospital, where he received
one unit of [**Hospital **] and ~1 L IVF. Due to poor respiratory status,
he received furosemide. He was then urgently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for suspected upper GI bleed related to his history of
multiple ERCPs.
.
Of note, patient has had upper respiratory sypmtoms for the last
3 to 4 weeks and presented to his primary care physician several
days prior to coming in for his acute complaint at this
admission. He was prescribed an antibiotic of which he does not
recall the name. Regardless, he never filled the prescription.
He notes his breathing is a bit labored and though denies acute
complaints, later admits that he has had increased cough and
sputum production in last week.
.
Vitals upon presentation to the ED were: T 98, HR 120, BP
100/74, RR 16, O2Sat 100% on NRB. Once arriving at [**Hospital1 18**], ED
obtained NG lavage, which failed to clear of [**Hospital1 **] and noted
large amounts of melena. Additionally, U/A which showed moderate
bacteria and positive nitrite, but was without WBCs. Urine
culture and [**Hospital1 **] cultures are pending. Patient was given
pantoprazole IV as only medical intervention. Patient was
maintained on a non-rebreather throughout his stay in the ED and
sats were 100%. He was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with
RVR and HR was in the 110s to 120s throughout his ED stay with
no intervention performed. GI, hepatology, and ERCP were
consulted. GI attending in ED felt that source of bleed was
likely to be sphincterotomy site as patient had an ERCP in
[**8-/2126**], which was complicated by ulcerative bleed around stent.
Surgery deferred managment decisions to GI and ERCP team.
Patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to signout of the
patient to the admitting medicine ICU team due to need for
emergent ERCP.
.
Patient originally came to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and went urgently to ERCP, where
was quickly noted to be exanguinating from duodenum, though
bleeding was too brisk to localize further as several units of
[**Hospital Unit Name **] were reported to be seen in stomach as well as in the
small bowel. ERCP was aborted and trauma line was plaed by
anesthesia in ERCP suite prior to patient being transferred back
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for stabilization. Massive transfusion protocol was
activated and paitent was transfused 5 units PRBC and 2 units
FFP prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] for
stabilization prior to IR attempted angio and embolization.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2116**],
PCI native left circumflex [**2124**], systolic heart failure, and
multiple sclerosis, presented with melena from [**Hospital3 **]. Found to be having massive upper GI bleed as well as
cholangitis and pneumonia. Suspected source of bleeding was from
recent biliary stenting where he had bled in the past. He
urgently went to ERCP where he was seen to be bleeding near the
duodenal papilla at the site of a prior spincterotomy and bleed.
Sclerosis and ligation were unsuccessful at ERCP. IR was called
and he went to angio. At angio the gastroduodenal artery was
identified as the bleeding source. Embolization was
unsuccessful. Surgery was following throughout. After IR could
not embolize the source of bleeding, surgery was urgently called
to the bedside. Surgery felt the patient was an extremely high
operative risk given his CHF, PNA, Afib, MS, and cholangitis on
top of his GI bleed. His wife was [**Name (NI) 653**] by surgery and she
agreed to defer surgery. The patient was made DNR at that point.
He continued to massively hemorrhage. Again his wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] and he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**]. He expired shortly thereafter
from exsanguination.

[**2141-10-1**] IVC filter


History of Present Illness:
This 33 year old white male is well known to our service as he
presented with Type A aortic dissection approximately 2 weeks
ago.  Post-op course complicated
by stroke with residual LUE weakness and RUE motor loss which
began to return prior to discharge.  He was discharged to rehab
on POD 10.  He returns today complaining of chest pressure that
came on at rest.  It is present across the chest without
radiation.  It is unlike his presenting pre-op pain, and not the
incisional pain he experienced post-operatively.  Pain improves
with ativan.  Pain is associated with SOB and anxiety.  CXR is
unremarkable, initial
ED ultrasound reportedly does not reveal pericardial effusion.
EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia.

The patient is not anticoagulated, and symptoms are concerning
for PE.  Additionally, he is found to be in renal failure with a
rise in creatinine from 0.7 on discharge, to 2.4 today.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 33 year old man with recent Type A
dissection now c/o acute exacerbation of  similar chest pain
 Final Report
There is an intimal flap arising from the proximal extent of the
aortic arch, extending all the way inferiorly into the left
common iliac artery, consistent with aortic dissection. The left
subclavian and left common carotid arteries arise from what
appears to be the true lumen. The innominate artery has been
bypassed and arises from the lateral aspect of the aortic root,
proximal to the dissection flap (4, 24). The celiac trunk, SMA,
and bilateral renal arteries also arise from the true lumen. The
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] arises from the false lumen (4, 79). Patient is status post
type A dissection repair of the thoracic aorta and arch with
post-surgical changes. There are soft tissue densities
surrounding the aortic root without definite evidence of active
extravasation.
Curvilinear calcifications are seen at the aortic root. There is
bypass of
the innominate artery, which is normal in caliber and patent.
Within
limitation of current examination, there is no definite
extension of the
dissection into internal or external iliac arteries on the left.
The right
iliac artery arises from the true lumen.
CT CHEST: The thyroid demonstrates no focal lesion. A few mildly
enlarged
prevascular and precarinal lymph nodes are noted, likely
reactive. The heart is normal in size without significant
pericardial effusion. Moderate left and small right pleural
effusions are seen with associated compressive atelectasis.
Ill-defined peripheral areas of ground-glass opacities
predominating the left upper lobe and right lower lobe are
nonspecific, which could represent infectious, inflammatory, or
ischemic changes.
A nonocclusive pulmonary embolus is seen in the right main
pulmonary artery extending into the upper, middle, and lower
lobe subsegmental pulmonary arteries. No definite pulmonary
embolism is appreciated in the left lung, although evaluation is
limited since current study is not tailored for evaluation of
pulmonary embolism.
CT ABDOMEN: Within limitation of early contrast bolusing
limiting organ
evaluation, the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands
appear within
normal limits. Gallbladder contains intermediate density
material in its
dependent portion, suggestive of sludge. Bilateral kidneys
demonstrate
symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The
stomach,
small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free
air or free fluid.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is collapsed, with a Foley catheter in
place. The
rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable. There is no
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid
within the pelvis. A 5.5 x 2.8 cm area of simple fluid is
present in the right groin, anterior to the distal aspect of the
right external iliac artery, with several adjacent small clips,
likely related to recent intervention.
BONE WINDOWS: No definite concerning focal lesion. A bone island
is seen in the right anterior acetabulum. Anterior median
sternotomy wires appear
aligned.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post recent thoracic aorta and arch repair with soft
tissue
densities surrounding aortic root without definite evidence of
active
extravasation.
2. Aortic dissection with intimal flap arising from the proximal
aortic arch distal to the origin of innominate artery bypass,
extending the entire length of the descending aorta into
proximal left common iliac artery. All major branching vessels
arise from the true lumen with the exception of the inferior
mesenteric artery, which arises from the false lumen.
3. Pulmonary embolus within the main right pulmonary artery
extending into
subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the upper, middle, and lower
lobes.
4. Ground glass peripheral pulmonary opacities in the left upper
lobe and
right lower lobe are nonspecific, which could represent
infection,
inflammation, or ischemic sequelae. Moderate left and small
right pleural
effusions.
5. Probable gallbladder sludge.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 33 year old man with s/p cardiac
surgery, acute renal failure
Final Report
HISTORY: Acute renal failure. Evaluate for acute process.
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.2 cm and left kidney
measures 11.75
cm. No stones or hydronephrosis are present. There is a possible
1.7 x 1.4 x 1.6 cm hypoechoic lesion in the interpolar region of
the left kidney, which may be a cyst, but evaluation is
suboptimal on this examination, which was technically
challenging due to inability to reposition the patient.
IMPRESSION:
No stones, no hydronephrosis. Possible cyst within the
interpolar region of the left kidney, but this is suboptimally
visualized.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
M.r [**Known lastname 79362**] was seen in the emergency room and assessed for new
onset chest pain associated with anxiety and shortness of
breath. He was also noted to have elevated creatinine.

His cardiac enzymes, EKG and chest X-Ray were unrevealing. An
initial echo showed no pericardial effusion/tamponade or RV
strain.
He was admitted for hydration and started on heparin for
presumed pulmonary embolism. He was scheduled for renal
ultrasound, LENI's to assess for venous thrombosis and when the
LENI's were positive for thrombus a chest CT to assess for
pulmonary embolism.

The chest CT revealed: A nonocclusive pulmonary embolus is seen
in the right main pulmonary artery extending into the upper,
middle, and lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary arteries. No
definite pulmonary embolism is appreciated in the left lung.
Vascular surgery was consulted for IVC filter placement, this
was placed on [**2141-10-1**].
Renal US revealed no obstruction or hydronephrosis however his
UA was positive-   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2141-10-1**]): PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA. 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML. He was treated with
Ciprofloxacin.

Following IVC filter placement his Heparin infusion resumed he
was started on warfarin and the remainder of his hospital course
was uneventful.
He was discharged to [**Hospital6 **] Center in
[**Location (un) 246**], MA on [**2141-10-3**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo female with a history of MS, fibromyalgia, DM,
Htn, spinal stenosis s/p spinal fusion, CAD s/p MI, and hx of
DVTs s/p IVC filter who presents with 3 days of worsening whole
body spasms, throbbing pain in her spine and neck, and
difficulty swallowing. She describes the pain as [**7-13**] throbbing
which is constant. She has never had similar pain. Also states
she has spasms all over her body which cause her arms and legs
to twitch/move on their own as well as cause her to bite her
tongue in her sleep. She admits to loss of bowel/bladder
continence in the past, but states that it has resolved since
losing weight (she states she lost 45 lbs in 2 months). Admits
to blurry vision in the last few days residual weakness on her
left side, lightheadedness, chest pain related to her spasms.
.
She also reports difficulty swallowing, denies pain with
swallowing, but states she chokes on food. She last had a MS
flare in [**Month (only) **] and stated that she ended up in rehab for 2 months
after it. Her symptoms at the time included inability to speak
and leg weakness.
.
She admits to fever to 101.0 starting 3 days ago, chills, night
sweats. States she occaionally has photopobia at baseline which
hasn't changed. No recent sick contacts or travel other then to
[**Name (NI) 86**]. No triggers recalled prior to onset of pain. Also admits
to N/V and shortness of breath earlier. Denies change in
sensation.
.
In the ED, her inital VS were T 97.3 BP 141/85 HR 84 RR 16 Sat
98% on RA. She was given 5 mg IV valium x 2, 1 mg IV dilaudid x
3, 1 mg IV ativan x 1, 2 mg IV dilaudid x 1, and tylenol for her
fever. Also given acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV, valium 10 mg IV x 1,
another 1 mg dilaudid x 1, and moxifloxacin 400 mg IV (not
signed off as given, unclear if she received this). Neuro
evaluated her and were not convinced this was a MS flare and
wanted her admitted. She then spiked to 101.7 and became
tachycardic to the 130's 140's and was given 1 L NS and meds as
above. An LP was attempted 3 times, but was not successful.
.
ROS: The patient denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, hematochezia, orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity oedema, cough, dysuria, rash or skin changes.

MRI Head:
Final Report
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM

HISTORY: MS; assess for disease activity.

Comparison is made with CT head from [**2132-12-11**].

FINDINGS:

There are scattered white matter lesions, some of which are in a

periventricular location compatible with clinical history of
multiple
sclerosis. None of the lesions demonstrate enhancement. There is
no
hydrocephalus or acute ischemia.

There is a small lesion in the midline pons.

IMPRESSION:

Mild scattered white matter lesions compatible with history of
multiple
sclerosis. None of the lesions demonstrate enhancement.

<br>

[**12-14**] and [**2132-12-15**] blood cultures without growth at time of d/c
********rehab facility to f/u on these culture to assure the
bacteremia has cleared succesfully
<br>

Renal US:
<br>
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis or renal calculi detected.
2. Mildly echogenic architexture of the liver suggesting fatty
infiltration.
Dedicated liver ultrasound may be obtained to confirm this
finding given
limited evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 yo F who presents with a questionable MS
flare in the setting of bacteremia, from presumed line
infection.  Pt with hospital course including brief MICU stay -
mult LPs attemped unsuccessfully - later with clearer main issue
with acinetobacter bacteremia which has possible worsened her MS
sx but without evid of flare (CNS infx not suspected at that
point).  Transfered to floor - ID consulted for assistance with
infx - neurology consulted for assessing MS - at the end deemed
NOT an active flare and ID with total 14day course of levoquin
for bacteremia (port was d/c of note).  Details of course as
below by problem.
<br>

#.Line infection with associated bacteremia. S/p POC removal.
Blood cultures now showing acinetobacter and GPC as above; GPC
thought to be contaminant as ID consulted and evaluated.
-Previously on aztreonam and levofloxacin for GNR coverage, and
Linezolid for MRSA coverage
-now narrowed to just Levofloxacin per ID recs.
-[**12-14**] and [**12-15**] f/u blood culture without growth at time of d/c -
*********rehab to f/u on these blood cx to assure no later
growth to confirm bacteremia cleared.
-plan to complete 14d course of levoquin for bactermia - will
NOT replace POC at this time - outpt f/u as indicated by outpt
neurologist
<br>

# Multiple Sclerosis
Not appearing as flare - mild exacerbation of old sx with
bacteremia - with also mild psych component.  Pt more assured
with MRI findings NOT consistant with new active flare.
- Appreciate neuro consult,if patient in the [**Location (un) 86**] area for
prolonged time period - pt instructed to call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 82086**] to
make an appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 82087**] (MS specialist) -
otherwise to follow-up with her neurologist in [**State 108**].
- Continue her baclofen (reduced to TID [**12-14**] due to sedation on
[**12-14**]), methocarbamol for spasms.)
<br>

#. Chronic pain
-Appreciate recs - on baclofen, dilaudid, oxycontin.
Pt noted to be somnolent but arousable with poor attention on
[**12-14**], likely as a result of Oxycontin dose. Pain svc recommended
increasing po dilaudid dose, however, will hold off considering
pt's narcosis on [**12-14**]. Maintained current dose of Oxycontin,
although low threshold to decrease dose if persistently
somnolent. Overall now pain is managable - d/c on doses as below
- pt comfortable with currently regime - if pain not adequatly
controlled titrate up with much caution.
<br>

# Acute renal failure: Patient's Cr increased from 0.9 to 1.4.
Now appears improved s/p fluid repletion
-nml dosing with improved renal fx of meds (changed levo back up
to 750mg qd on [**12-15**])
- Renal ultrasound done - no hydro.
<br>

# DM II, controlled, without complications: Held home glipizide
during stay adn covered with SSI, BS range finally in higher
range day prior to d/c - plan to re-start home glipizide but at
[**12-5**] original dose - 5mg qdaily.
-*****pt to continue SSI at rehab and qac/qhs finger sticks - if
BS still >150s persistantly for 2 days would return to 10mg
qdaily dose of glipizide.

<br>

# HTN, benign:  held her home amlodipine for now. BP controlled
- rehab to f/u BP as routine and if starts to increase consider
re-starting her home dose of amlodipine as below.
<br>

# FEN: Appreciate S&S recs.
-PO diet: regular solids, thin liquids with new S&S recs
-PO meds: whole with thin liquids
-1:1 supervision with meals to assist with self-feed and
maintain standard aspiration precautions
<br>

History of Present Illness:
48 yo LH woman with a history of MS x 2 years, migraine
headaches, HTN, cervical and lumbar spondylosis, and depression
was in her USOH until [**12-27**], when she experienced an atypical
headache.  Her typical headaches in the past have typically been
left temporoparietal in distribution, occasional with radiation
to the front of the head and the neck.  They are severe [**10-16**],
stabbing in quality, and have lasted anywhere from 2 hrs. to 3
days in duration.  They often have associated photo- and
phonophobia.  She frequently has associated double vision in all
directions of gaze, even with each eye closed.  These headaches
improve while laying down in a dark room, and worsen with
Valsalva.

On [**12-27**], the patient reports the onset of a different kind of
headache while riding in the car.  This headache was diffuse,
bilateral, through the head and neck.  She describes it as
pounding, sudden in onset, and her ""worst ever.""  She
experienced the same double vision as with other headaches.  She
was
diaphoretic and ""dizzy"" (vertiginous and pre-syncopal).  She
went to an OSH at that time, where a CT head was reportedly
negative and the patient discharged home.  The headache
gradually improved somewhat, but never entirely subsided over
the ensuing week.  It did improve with lying down, although she
did has been awoken by it at night.  She had some mild nausea
and ""awkward on [my] feet""
over the following week.  At 4 pm yesterday ([**2189-1-2**]), the same
headache worsened to its previous intensity and she returned to
an OSH ED. CT head there demonstrated showed a small amount of
bilateral SAH, for which she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and management.  Here, a NCHCT showed
scattered foci of SAH in frontal lobes bilaterally, without mass
effect; no aneurysm seen on CT.  The patient was admitted by
neurosurgery,
who performed cerebral angiogram that reported foci of stenosis
in both posterior cerebral arteries and their branches. There
was concern for vasculitis or focal spasm.  While
atherosclerosis was also considered, there was no evidence of
atherosclerosis elsewhere in the interrogated vasculature.


Review of Systems:
+ F/C, nausea, short- and long- term memory loss, chronic
left-sided weakness with MS, right hand tingling x 2 months
(from
last two digits through entire palm, chronic LLE numbness and
tingling in the front of both the foot and calf; recent plane

-vomiting, loss of vision, changes in taste, smell, dysphagia,
seizures, incontinence (urinary or bowel), weight loss; no
reported head or neck manipulation

CTA head and neck [**2189-1-3**]:   The non-contrast CT scan
demonstrates diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage over the
convexities with normal appearance of the basal cisterns.

The CTA examination demonstrates mild atheromatous disease at
the right common carotid bifurcation, and otherwise appears
normal.

<br>
Cerebral angiogram [**2189-1-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
2.  Foci of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and
their branches.  This may be related to vasculitis or focal
spasm.  While atherosclerosis may also be considered, there is
no
evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the interrogated
vasculature.
3.  Anterior communicating artery is not visualized, likely
representing aplasia or hypoplasia.

<br>
MRI HEAD [**2189-1-4**]:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, consistent with 12/29 CTA
head.

2. Scattered subcortical acute infarcts located bilaterally in
the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, of unclear etiology.

3. No findings of demyelinating disease.

<br>
CT HEAD [**2188-1-9**]:
Unchanged mild subarachnoid hemorrhage with no new bleeding or
fracture.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48-year-old woman with a history of migraine
headaches, hypertension, cervical and lumbar spondylosis, and
depression who presented with headache. Prior to admission, she
had had a CT that showed small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A cerebral angiogram revealed no aneurysm, but concern for  foci
of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and their
branches that could
be related to vasculitis or focal spasm. Vasculitis was ruled
out with a normal ESR (12). The presentation was consistent with
Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] Syndrome, or reversible cerebral artery
vasoconstriction. This was confirmed with serial transcranial
dopplers demonstrating increased velocities. She was started on
high doses of Verapamil. Although doses as high as 720 mg per
day have been used, she did well with only 600 mg, and tolerated
this dose without side effect. Her TCD on the day of discharge
showed markedly improved velocities, suggesting improvement of
her vasospasm.

Her headache persisted, although improved to the point that she
was able to perform banking and other routine online chores from
her hospital bed. Her pain regimen was unchanged; see discharge
medications. Her gait initially appeared somewhat unsteady, but
she was able to walk with a narrow base. PT was eventually able
to clear her for discharge home.

History of Present Illness:
88 yo female with hx of Multiple Sclerosis, DM p/w hypoglycemia,
hypothermia from nursing home.  Per NH worker, patient had low
HR to 40-50 (baseline that am had been 70s) and reported that
she was feeling off-balance.  Per EMS had FS 30 and given 1M
glucagon.  Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 79210**] had a  recent UTI w/ ATBx at [**Location (un) 745**]
[**Hospital 3678**] Hospital for 7 days.  Her baseline mental status is
oriented x 3 with reported fluid conversation about current
political climate.

Patient had 2 admissions in the past 3 weeks for AMS.  One week
after [**Holiday 1451**] she developed AMS and was taken to [**Hospital 732**]
Hospital.  They thought she had a UTI but her culture was
negative.  She had a temperature during that admission of 92.0.
She returned to the [**Hospital3 5277**] and one week later was
admitted to [**Location **] Wellesly with AMS and hypothermia.  She was
altered for 3 days and had 2 CTs and an MRI which were
inconclusive.  She returned to the institution where on date of
arrival she began having AMS again.  Per NH worker, patient's MS
had retunred to baseline.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, vitals were: T 97.1, HR 55, BP
130/60, RR 18, O2Sat 96% RA. In the ED was noted to have
somnolence, though would respond appropriately to questions when
awakened.  Was given 1L fluid bolus and then started on D51/2NS
@ 100 mL/hr due to hypoglycemia. Blood cultures were drawn and a
U/A with urine culture was sent in addition to stool cultures
including clostridium dificile. A CXR showed CHF, and b/l L>R
pleural effusions but no consolidation.  Patient was empirically
given Vancomycin and Zosyn. Prior to presentation to the floor,
vitals were: T 33.7 rectally, HR irregular 40s-50s, BP 101/35,
RR 13, O2Sat 99% 2L NC.  Patient was given another 1L NS bolus
enroute.

2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
3. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis with recent
admissions for altered mental status and recent urinary
infections, who presents with bradycardia and hypothermia.

#. Septic shock: She was admitted with hypothermia and
hypotension that was thought to be due to overwhelming sepsis
from UTI; however, cultures never yielded an organism.  The most
likely source was felt to be the urinary tract, especially given
her recent admissions for UTIs.  An infectious work-up including
cultures and CXR were done and the patient was started on
Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at admission which was changed to
Vanc/Meropenem/Cipro on [**11-15**]. Her PICC line discontinued on
[**11-14**], and Ms. [**Known lastname 79211**] tested negative for C. diff.  She
required pressor support through [**11-17**].  Her central venous
pressures were initially low.  She responded well to IVF, though
with increased pulmonary edema on x-ray; however, they were
continued due to improved clinical picture and stable O2 sats.

Over the [**Holiday **] holiday, patient took a turn for the worse;
she became less responsive, and temperatures ranged as low as
90.5.  She also refused BairHugger or more blankets stating she
""needed air.""  Most likely representative of overwhelming septic
infection.  After long discussions with the family, it was felt
that maximal medical care was not improving patient's
condition/situation, and focus was changed toward optimizing
patient comfort.  Family was onboard with all medical decisions
and seemed very satisfied with care.  On [**11-21**], patient was made
""CMO"" and antibiotics were withdrawn.  Patient passed peacefully
overnight on [**11-22**].

#. Pyelonephritis: The most likely source of her infection was
felt to be the urinary source.  A CT torso was performed, which
showed bilateral pleural effusions, and right hydroureter and
hydronephrosis.  Urology was consulted, and felt that the
hydroureter could be a source of infection, but could be treated
conservatively with antibiotics as long as the patient remained
stable.

#. Dyspnea:  Patient had a subjective sense of dyspnea during
admission but maintained a normal blood gas on nasal canula.  It
was felt to be due to anxiety, delirium, and exacerbated by
BairHugger.  Patient was treated symptomatically with morphine
and ativan.

#. Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine dose as FT4
WNL.
#. Multiple sclerosis:  During hospital course, baclofen was
started (home medication) for MS.
#. HTN: Home antihyptertensives were held in the setting of
hypotension and shock.
#. PPX:  Continued DVT ppx with Lovenox 40 daily

IMAGING
[**12-7**]: CT C/A/P:  1. Undisplaced acute left lower rib fractures
and nondisplaced fracture through the left inferior pubic ramus
as described above. There is no pneumothorax. 2. Up to 4 mm
pulmonary nodules in the right lower lobe need followup with a
chest CT in three months to ensure stability. 3. A filling
defect in the upper pole calyx of the left kidney could
represent a blood clot; however, the possibility of an
urothelial neoplasm cannot be excluded and a renal MRI is
recommended for further assessment.
[**12-17**] CTOH: no hemorrhage
[**12-17**] CT ABD: Distended large bowel, cecum @ 9.8cm, inflammatory
changes and fluid surrounding cecum and proximal asc colon, no
transition point. No abscess, free air or pneumatosis.
Fracture of left posterior [**10-20**] ribs.
Fracture of the left sacrum.
Fracture of the left inferior and superior pubic rami.
[**12-18**] CXR: No evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Markedly dilated
loops of large bowel.
[**12-19**] KUB: unchanged
[**12-20**] KUB: increased LOB, mainly colon
[**12-21**] CTABD: Colonic wall thickening in the ascending and
proximal transverse colon, no free air, b/l pleural effusions
L>R, fractures unchanged
[**12-29**] KUB: Compared to the study from [**2159-12-20**] the colon is no
longer as
distended. The stomach is distended with a large amount of
material within it and gas seen crossing midline. Gas is seen in
loops of small bowel and large bowel. On the supine view there
is no evidence of free air but this would be better assessed on
the upright or lateral decubitus film.
IMPRESSION: Distended stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo woman h/o hypertension, DMII, hyperlipid, hypothyroid,
recent admission after fall for left non-displaced pubic ramus
fracture, presenting from rehab on [**12-17**] with abdominal
distention, concern of C dif colitis in setting of recent cipro
for UTI.
.
Hospital Course on Surgical Service ([**Date range (1) 81918**]):
.
Patient presented from rehab dehydrated with mental status
changes and abdominal distention, probable C diff (toxin
negative).  Her white count was 30 at time of admission (see
labs above).  She had a dilated R colon (?opiate induced vs
C.diff) and initially had no bowel movements or flatus.
.
She was seen by GI service who recommended for decompression
with rectal tube and NGT, and continued avoidance of narcotics.
She was switched to IV flagyl and po vanco and improved.
However, she began having copious diarrhea, requiring up to
100-120 mEq IV potassium daily.  She never developed hypotension
and her HR remained stable 70-80s.  She was tranferred to the
medicine service on [**12-25**] for management of diarrhea.
.
.
Hospital Course on Medicine Service ([**Date range (1) 81919**]):
.
At time of transfer, she had no significant complaints.  She had
mild low right back pain, persisting from her fall.  She denied
abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or
lightheadedness.  She denied subjective fevers or chills.  Her
hospital course by problem is below:
.
1. Diarrhea.
Our differential diagnosis for her diarrhea included infectious
(C. dif versus bacterial), poor sphincter tone from
deconditioning, or exacerbation of MS.  Stool cultures and C dif
were re-sent, and these returned negative.  We consulted
neurology who felt that her fecal incontinence was unlikely
related to MS flare and more likely related to dementia and
deconditioning.  They noted that she likely suffers from mild
chronic dementia, with acute worsening in the setting of
infection, narcotic use, and metabolic abnormalities.  They
recommended against MRI as they had a low index of suspicion for
spinal cord involvement.
.
We contined Flagyl to complete a 14-day course and we removed
her rectal tube.  We reinvolved physical therapy as we felt that
her incontinence was most likely related to deconditioning.
With these conservative interventions the frequency of her loose
stools decreased.  Furthermore, her stools are becoming more
formed at discharge and we suspect that this will aid her
ability to sense when she needs to void.
.
2. Pain control.
We held all narcotics given our concern that narcotic-related
constipation was largely to blame for her abdominal distention
at time of admission.  We treated her pain with standing doses
of ibuprofen (with meals) and tylenol as needed.
.
3. Wound care.
Nurses have noticed that there is reddening of the skin in the
sacral area, although no ulceration.  They have been regularly
treating the area with antifungal powder, cleaning and drying.
She should continue to receive this care in rehab to prevent
skin breakdown and decubitus ulceration.
.
4. Hypertension.
We continued her outpatient Losartan and increased her
amlodipine to a dose of 10 mg once daily.  We added
hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg once daily.
.
5. Hyperlipid.
We continued her outpatient statin.
.
6. Hypothyroid.
We increased her levothyroxine to 112 mcg when TFTs showed
slight hypothyroidism.
.
7. Diabetes.
Endocrinology was consulted for management of hyperglycemia
during this admission.  With their recommendations, we increased
her dose of pioglitazone to 30 mg once daily, increased
glyburide to 5 mg twice daily, and kept the metformin at 500 mg
twice daily.  Her standing insulin dose has also been adjusted
to 33U of glargine at bed time, with sliding scale humalog
insulin as outlined in the medications.
.
7. Lung nodules.
She will need outpatient follow-up imaging for lung nodules
noted on chest CT [**12-7**].
.
8. Left renal mass.
She will need outpatient f/u MRI for urothelial neoplasm vs clot
noted in the left kidney from CT abdomen [**12-7**].
.
She was kept on a diabetic diet.  Subcutaneous heparin was used
for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.  Her code status is full
code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for treatment of abdominal distention and
diarrhea.  We were concerned that you had an infection of the
gastrointestinal tract.  We were not able to confirm this
infection because all of the culture data was negative.
However, we treated you presumptively with a 14-day course of
antibiotics to help clear infection if present.  We also
involved physical therapy in your care.  With these treatments,
your abdominal distention resolved and your diarrhea improved.
.
We have made several changes to your medications.  They are as
follows:
1. We increased the glyburide to 5 mg twice dialy.
2. We increased the amlodipine to 10 mg once daily.
3. We added hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg once daily.
4. We changed the insulin regimen.
5. We incresed levothyroxine to 112 mcg once daily.
6. We stopped the lidocaine patch.
7. We stopped the oxycodone.
.
You have been seen by physical therapists during this admission
who recommend discharge to rehab.  Please follow-up with your
primary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**], after you leave rehab.

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea in the setting of multiple sclerosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley replacement


History of Present Illness:
54 year-old man with secondary progressive MS (seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] in [**2152-8-23**]), complicated by neurogenic bladder and
recurrent and recent UTI/urosepsis, s/p baclofen pump placement
for spasticity, and left leg DVT diagnosed three months ago, now
on warfarin, who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 3383**]
Hospital for dyspnea.

The patient reports that he was admitted to [**Hospital3 3383**]
Hospital last week in the setting of fever, and was found to
have a urinary tract infection.  He was treated with antibiotics
for the infection and was apparently given steroids for concern
of a flare of his multiple sclerosis.  After three days, he was
discharged back to his group home.  Upon arrival home, he was
short of breath even after speaking two to three  words.  His
voice was somewhat ""soft and squeaky.""  He returned to [**Doctor Last Name 1263**]
for further evaluation of this complaint, and was admitted on
[**10-24**].

At [**Doctor Last Name 1263**], he underwent a full pulmonary evaluation, including a
CTA of the chest, which was reportedly negative for pulmonary
embolism and showed normal lung parenchyma.  An ABG on 3LNC was
7.49/50/104/98 on [**10-25**].  He did have a leukocytosis (15.1) and a
positive UA  (positive nitrites, small leukocyte esterase, 35-75
WBC, many bacteria).  He was treated with cefuroxime and changed
to ceftazidime for a presumed urinary tract infection.  A urine
culture was pending.  There was concern that his respiratory
difficulties could be related to progression of his multiple
sclerosis, or even an exacerbation.  He was started on 1 g
salmeterol daily that was reduced to 80 mg IV q 8 hours.  Given
the concern that his presentation could be related to his MS, he
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] (where he has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] for
further evaluation and management.

Review of Systems:
He denies current fever, nausea, vomiting, and headache.  His
vision is stable.  He denies dysphagia and reports that his
motor and sensory function is at baseline.  He denies chest pain
and reports that he is breathing comfortably.  He suffers from
chronic constipation.

Past Medical History:
-Secondary progressive MS.  His course is well-described in the
prior note from [**Hospital **] clinic in [**Month (only) 359**].  Though he was diagnosed
with SPMS in [**2128**], it is though that his course may have begun
10 years before that date.  Prior relapses were localized to the
cord and left optic nerve.  He has had weakness of the legs
progressing to total paralysis in [**2145**].  He was diagnosed with
left optic neuritis in [**2134**], and had no recovery thereafter.  He
had a baclofen pump placed in [**2150**] for treatment of his
spasticity; he has had partial relief of his symptoms.  In the
past, he has been treated with Avonex, Copaxone, and  ovantrone.

He was not a candidate for Tysabri when assessed in [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2151**].
-Neurogenic bladder with indwelling catheter and recurrent
UTI/urosepsis
-Dyslipidemia
-Lower extremity edema
-Hypothyroidism
-Depression

Social History:
Lives in the [**Location (un) 86**] Home long-term care facility with his
girlfriend. Divorced with three children; sister lives in the
area.  Worked as a landscaper until his symptoms became too
disabling, in [**2132**].  Smoked tobacco briefly for 1-2 years in his
20s.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per week, including
Kamikazes and White Russians.  He has used marijuana for his MS
in the past, with good symptomatic relief.  He denies a history
of IVDU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 80280**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with dyspnea and weakness.
While in the critical care unit, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 80280**] remained stable
from the respiratory point of view. He did not require
intubation. Pulmonary function tests are arranged as an
outpatient (NIF/FVC on discharge was -30 and 2.5L).

His steroids were stopped on [**10-27**] and he continued improving
clinically. Once in the floors, and as per Dr.[**Name (NI) 25950**] input,
the steroid course was restarted for 4 days, then stopped when
he developed steroid psychosis. This improved without
intervention.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] ([**Hospital **] clinic) was called. He explained no further
neuroimaging was required as this point.  In addition, he feels
no disease modifying therapy would be helpful. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 80280**] was
scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] as an outpatient.

His UTI was empirically treated with ceftazidime initially,
given his previus UTIs and chronic cathether. This was then
changed to ceftriaxone and eventually changed to bactrim once
the culture evidenced an acinetobacter infection. He received a
couple days of unasyn due to elevated INR on the bactrim. Total
antibiotic course was 7 days. Urology was consulted and
recommended weekly foley flushes with Neomycin-Polymyxin B, and
outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**].

He had supratherapeutic INRs while on bactrim, requiring the
coumadin to be held. It was restarted when the patient became
therapeutic and eventually returned to his home dose. He was
subtherapeutic with an INR of 1.5 and lovenox was started.

Another critical issue is the patient's rigidity. In this
regard, he currently is on baclofen pump plus po, and remains
quite spastic. The pain service was consulted to evaluate the
pump, and noted that he might benefit from a higher dose by
pump. It was not changed while inpatient. He was continued on
the baclofen dose that was arranged at [**Hospital 1263**] hospital.

In addition, there was a question of central apnea, and he might
benefit from outpatient polysomnogram. This can be scheduled as
an outpatient as indicated.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsiveness, altered, intubated for airway protection found
to have urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubated, mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
65 yo female with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 84078**] for questionable hx TMJ who was
sent in from her NSH after being found covered in vomit with
agonal breathing.  NSH notes reports ""symptoms of seizure
activity"" with patient subsequently unresponsive and found to be
hypoxic with sats <83% on 2L.  Per EMS, she was unresponsive en
route, still breathing but not withdrawing to pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: no temp recorded, 118 135/71 34
100% on NRB.  She was easily intubated for airway protection
with a grade 1 view.  Head CT was unremarkable for bleed.  Neuro
was consulted and felt this was likely toxic metabolic if
seizure activity, but will continue to follow.  She has had
multiple episodes of UTI in the past.  Blood and urine cultures
were sent and she was given vanco/zosyn.  Foley was changed.
Per the ED resident, they were not aware of her potential
allergy but she did not have a rash prior to transfer to the
MICU.  When the patient was signed out she was currently doing
well on vent with most recent vitals prior to transfer being
afeb, 92, 103/60 with sats 100% on 400x18, 5x50%.  She dropped
her pressures prior to transfer to 67/41 with HR 94.  She was
given 2L of IVF and started on levophed.  Sedation was held.
.
Of note, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 84079**] note to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] last admission was
for urinary tract infection, E. coli bacteremia, and sepsis, and
initially required admission to the ICU for vasopressor support.
She was also found to have an obstructing left renal stone and
had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed with improvement in
her infection. She was able to be taken of vasopressor agents
and was discharged to complete a 14 day total course of
antibiotics.  At that time, urology recommended to leave the
nephrostomy tube in the left renal system indefinitely with tube
changes every 3 months as she was high risk for both
nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.  Her
hospital course was also notable for hypoxia with a 4L oxygen
requirement which was felt to be due to a combination of mild
volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of
multiple sclerosis and infection, and intermittent aspiration.
Her oxygen requirement was stable and she was discharged to
rehab to have gentle diuresis as tolerated and tocontinue her
usual dysphagia diet.  She has been on 2L at her NSH with
unclear continued workup.

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
and apical anterior and inferior walls. The remaining segments
contract well (LVEF 40%). The apex is not aneurysm and no apical
thrombus is seen. The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
distribution). Pulmonary artery hypertension.

CTAbd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Foley catheter is now positioned with its distal tip seen in
the right
ureter. Repositioning is recommended. These findings were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone at 12:10 a.m. on
[**2118-12-12**].

2. Left nephrostomy tube with small left subcapsular hematoma
and unchanged left ureteropelvic junction stone.

3. No evidence of small-bowel obstruction despite large amount
of stool seen within the rectum and sigmoid.

4. Unchanged right renal staghorn calculus.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right renal stones without hydronephrosis.

2. Unchanged mild left collecting system fullness.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo female with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] indwelling foley
and left percutaneous nephrostomy tube found to be unresponsive
admitted to the MICU with septic shock secondary to Pseudomonas
urosepsis. The patient was started on Meropenem and did well on
the floor.
.
1. Sepsis:  Urosepsis due to pseudomonas in setting of
obstructing stone.  Pt with known obstructing staghorn in R, & L
percutaneous nephrostomy for ureteral stone. The patient had
been on suppressive ertapenem, but this was switched to
Meropenem 500mg IV Q6hr given ID recs and better urinary
penetration. ID evaluated the patient and felt she should
continue on this antibiotic until obstruction relieved.  The
patient was started on methemazine and ascorbic acid for
symptomatic relief. Pt will follow up with outpatient urology to
undergo intraoperative lithotripsy/stone extraction.
.
2. Elevated troponin/Possible NSTEMI: Pt's troponin found to be
elevated on admission.  This was likely secondary to demand
ischemia in the setting of hypotension.  An echo was formed that
showed wall motion abnormalities, the chronicity of which could
not be determined.  The patient's troponin trended down and she
was monitored on telemetry for several days with no events.
.
3. Multiple sclerosis: The patient had relapsing and remitting
MS treated with Glatimer. Our neuro colleagues were initially
consulted to determine whether her altered mental status was
neurological in origin. They determined that it was not and did
not change her treatment regimen. She remains on Baclofen,
Glatimer, and cyclobenzaprine.
.
4. Hyperlipidemia: Continue simvastatin
.
5. Depression: Continue citalopram
.
6. CODP: Respiratory status stable. Continue nebulizers/inhalers
.
7. Follow Up: The patient will follow up with urology for
elective stone removal.  She will continue on meropenem until
urinary obstruction is remedied.
.
Transitional Issues: The patient had yeast grow in 2 of 2 urine
cultures. With her h/o urosepsis and indwelling catheters, we
called her rehab facility and recommended starting Fluconazole.
As an outpatient, the patient should be started on a low dose
B-blocker given her NSTEMI. She should have outpatient
cardiology follow-up at some point as well.

no output from nephrostomy tube for the two days prior to
admission. The patient was also reported to have been satting at
77% on NBR when EMS arrived. The patient has been admitted three
times in the past year with urosepsis.

In the ER, the patient was febrile to 102.8 and tachycardic. She
had a leukocytosis to 16.4. Her foley catheter was exchanged and
foul-smelling urine emerged. She had numerous excoriations
within and around her vagina and decubitus ulcers on her sacrum.
The nephrostomy tube was encrusted, and when cleaned, purulent
discharge emerged. She also had erythema and fluctuance with
expressible pus around the nephrostomy site. The patient was
given vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl. She was transferred to
the MICU with a systolic pressure of 85 on peripheral low-dose
levophed.

LABS ON DISCHARGE
lab draws were discontinued due to patient and husband's wishes
for comfort measures only.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65 year old female with history of MS,
dementia, neurogenic bladder with indwelling foley, b/l calculi
s/p left nephrostomy presenting with fatige and found to have
urosepsis.
.
ACUTE ISSUES
#Urosepsis:
The patient has long history of urinary tract infections with
MDR organisms including ESBL e. coli and pseudomonas due to her
abnormal anatomy. She has been considered for lithotripsy of
left UVJ stone in past but thought to be high risk due to
cardiac co-morbidities. The patient also has a staghorn calculus
in the right kidney. She presented febrile to 102.8 and with
systolic pressure in the 80s. Patient was found to have
foul-smelling urine from foley and purulent material emanating
from nephrostomy tube in the ER. She was started on low-dose
peripheral levophed and transferred to the MICU. She was started
on meropenem for likely ESBL E. coli and vancomycin. A Dobhoff
tube was inserted and the patient was started on tube feeds. A
goals of care discussion was had with the patient's husband, and
it was decided that the patient would seek comfort measures only
(see below). The patient was transferred to the floor for
continued management despite low pressures. On the floor she
remained clinically stable without the need for pressure
support. Her antibiotics were discontinued upon discharge.
.
#Goals of care:
The goals of care were discussed with the patient and husband in
both the ICU and the general medicine floor. After a long
discussion, it was decided that the patient would be continued
on IV antibiotics and tube feeds while inpatient. On the floor,
the patient removed her Dobhoff tube, and it was decided with
the husband not to reinitiate it. The patient's husband wished
to keep patient comfort at the forefront, but wanted to continue
interventions until the patient either declined or discontinued
them herself. Palliative care was consulted and it was planned
that the patient would return to her longterm care facility for
hospice services. IV antibiotics were discontinued, as they
would require PICC placement, which would not have been
consistent with pt and husband's goals of care. She was
discharged without antibiotics.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] ISSUES
#Multiple sclerosis:
Long history of MS (14 years), quite debilitated, now
experiencing dementia. The patient's home baclofen and
cyclobenzaprine were continued while inpatient.
.
#COPD:
The patient had a history of COPD with nknown baseline status.
It was reported that the patient uses home O2 at unknown rate.
She was continued on her ipratropium and fluticasone at home
doses and she was given O2 by nasal canula as needed.
.
#Depression:
Patient has [**Month/Day/Year **] depression and has been on SSRI at home.
This was continued while inpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**]??????s Urology service after
transuretral resection of prostate.  His operative course was
complicated by a very rough wakeup from anesthesia involving
significant valsalva that turned what was initially light pink
urine into bloody urine.  He was maintained on brisk continuous
bladder irrigation for the next 24 hours, and bled
significantly, requiring the foley to be placed on traction and
for transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for nursing purposes.  He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospitalization
and did not require blood transfusions despite a drop in hct
from 41 to 28.  He required multiple episodes of clot irrigation
to clear his bladder of old clot after his bleeding stopped on
POD 1.  His foley catheter was removed on POD 2 but the patient
failed to void so an 18 Fr coude catheter was replaced with
fruit punch colored drainage.  The foley was hand irrigated with
no evidence of clot.

At discharge, patient's pain well controlled with oral pain
medications, tolerating regular diet, ambulating without
assistance, and his foley was draining well. He was given oral
pain medications on discharge as well as a 3-day course of abx.
He was given explicit instructions to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] for
follow-up and foley removal/void trial.

Discharge Instructions:
Please call if your catheter stops draining or if your urine
continues to get darker.

The operation you have experienced is a ""scraping"" operation.
Bleeding was controlled with electrocautery which has produced a
""scab"" in the channel through which the urine passes (the
urethra). About 1-2 weeks after the operation, pieces of the
scab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs,
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear
impairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the
potential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for
the first 3 weeks after surgery.

You will be given a prescription for antibiotics to be taken for
a few days after surgery. This is to help prevent infection. If
you develop a fever over 101??????, chills, or pain in the testicles,
call your surgeon. Although not common, this may indicate
infection that has developed beyond the control of the
antibiotics that you have taken.

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recovery
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be ""a person
of leisure"". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by
any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which
have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such
as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug
store. Remember that the prostate is near the rectum, and
therefore, it is important for you to be mindful of the way you
sit. For example, sitting directly upright on a hard surface,
such as an exercise bicycle [**Last Name (LF) 10530**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cause bleeding. Reclining
on a soft sea, or sitting on a ""donut"", is best. Walking (not
jogging) is okay. You should avoid sexual activity during this
time. Also, avoid driving an automobile. This is important, not
because you are physically incapable of driving, but rather if
you have an urge to urinate, it is important that you void and
not let your bladder ""stretch"" too much, otherwise bleeding may
occur. Therefore, it is OK for you to be a passenger in an
automobile (or even to drive for very short distances).

During the second [**2-24**] week period of your recovery, you may
begin regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For
example, you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may
find it easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to
become quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is
best to take a nap! If you are a golfer, you may begin to swing
a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed during
the second 3 week period, but only on a limited basis. Remember
that the ejaculate may be directed back into the bladder (rather
than out), producing a ""dry"" orgasm which is a normal
consequence of the operation. This should not change the quality
of sex. In general, your overall activity may be escalated to
normal as you progress through this second time period, such
that by 6-8 weeks following the date of surgery, you should be
back to normal activity. Remember that your operation was a
""scraping"" operation and not all of the prostate was removed.
Therefore, you should still be monitored for prostate cancer
(assuming age and general medical conditions dictate such).

Within one week of discharge, call our office for your return
office visit appointment.

History of Present Illness:
57 M s/p TURP on [**3-21**] c/b post-op bleed requiring transfer to
the ICU for vigorous continuous bladder irrigation and foley
traction.  His bleeding slowed considerably on POD 1 and he was
transferred to the floor and discharged on POD 2 with a
discharge hct of 27.8 and fruit punch-colored urine in his 18 Fr
coude catheter.  His urine had been clearing slowly since that
time, but he did have one episode of clot retention, which
required simple irrigation at an OSH ED.  He went to Dr.[**Name (NI) 6444**]
clinic today for foley removal, but failed his voiding trial.
Cystoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] demonstrated plentiful clot adhered to
the bladder wall that could not be irrigated and removed.  The
patient subsequently had a presyncopal episode and transient
hypotension to the 60s/40s.  On further questioning, the pt does
note that he has had milder but similar episodes while walking
in the last few days.  He was taken by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 18**]

.
STUDIES:
CXR ([**2196-3-25**]): Cardiac size is normal. Some tortuosity of the
aorta is present, but there is no evidence of failure or
infiltrate. The costophrenic angles are clear.
.
EGD ([**2196-3-24**]):
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Clotted old blood was seen in the fundus.
Duodenum: A single cratered bleeding 8 mm ulcer was found in the
proximal second part of the duodenum. A visible vessel was seen
after injecting the area with epinephrine. Blood was seen in the
second portion of the duodenum and after careful washing and
examination of the area, we were able to identify the area of
bleeding. Once we identified the ulcer, an endoclip was placed
successfully and we injected epinephrine. 6 1cc Epinephrine
1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for hemostasis with success.
Impression: Ulcer in the proximal second part of the duodenum
(injection)
Blood in the fundus
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old woman with history of multiple
sclerosis who was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital with GI
bleed.
.
# GIB: She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU with an UGI bleed
manifested by melena. She was followed by the GI consult service
and EGD revealed a bleeding duodenal ulcer that was clipped. She
received 2 units of pRBCs on [**2196-3-24**] for hematocrit of 26.5. Her
hct responded appropriately and she did not require further
transfusions. Patient was transferred to the regular medical
floor on hospital day #2. Risk factors for PUD include aspirin
and ibuprofen use almost daily at home. Also, her smoking might
have worsened the underlying peptic ulcer disease. She was
couseled to stop NSAID use and also to quit smoking. She was
treated with IV PPI twice daily initially and transitioned to
PO. Hct is stable at 31.9 on the day of discharge. Serology for
H. pylori is pending at time of discharge.
.
# L Hand swelling: Minimal near an IV in left arm. No cord
palpated. IV was removed from the left arm and warm compresses
applied. This should be further monitored at the [**Hospital1 1501**] and if no
improvement with elevation and warm compresses, consider
ultrasound monitoring.
.
# Leukocytosis: On admission, she had an elevated WBC to 14.5,
with left shift, no bandemia. Etiology was unclear. She denied
cough, fever, chills, or dysuria. CXR was negative. Urinalysis
at [**Location (un) **] was negative. WBC at [**Location (un) **] was 7.7, so unclear if
leukocytosis is related to transfusion. She has remained
afebrile. Leukocytosis resolved and WBC is 8.9 on day of
discharge.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: She complained of frequent spasms from her
MS, triggered by movement. Her baclofen dosing was increased
from 10mg qHS to [**Hospital1 **]. She was continued on her outpatient
regimen of diazepam and tolterodine.
.
# HTN: Her outpatient cozaar was initially held in the setting
of GI bleed. Once hematocrit was stable she was re-started on
her outpatient regimen of cozaar 100mg PO daily.
.
# CAD: Unclear if h/o CAD, as pt denies and not on cardiac meds.
EKG shows TWF on EKG with no old for comparison. CEs negative x
2.
.
# Depression: Continued her outpatient sertraline.
.
# Glaucoma: Continued her outpatient latanoprost eye drops.
.
# Code status: Full code.
.
# Dispo: She was discharged to [**Location (un) 931**] House Rehab Center in
[**Location (un) 932**], MA.

IMAGING:
[**2116-5-20**]:
The lungs appear clear.  There has been interval resolution of
prior right basilar opacity.  No confluent opacity is
identified.  There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary
vasculature, though no overt interstitial edema.  No large
pleural effusion is evident.  There is no pneumothorax or
pneumomediastinum.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process

Brief Hospital Course:
52yo F with PMH MS, MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 37662**], neurogenic bladder with
suprapubic catheter and recurrent UTIs who presents with UTI and
sepsis from pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia.

# E. coli bacteremia/sepsis:  Patient with longstanding hx of
neurogenic bladder, suprapubic catheter and recurrent UTIs
presenting with UTI and tachycardia, hypotension, fever.
Hypotension and tachycardia responded to IVF and pt did not
require pressors.  She was treated broadly with vancomycin and
cefepime and BP stable prior to transfer to floor.  Blood
culture from [**5-20**] grew pan-sensitive E. coli and patient was
switched to PO cipro after bcx >48 hours negative.  Discharged
on PO cipro for a 14-day course (last day [**2116-6-3**])

# UTI:  Patient known to have recurrent complicated UTIs in the
setting of her indwelling catheter. UA suggestive of UTI at
rehab day prior to admission, was started on cefpodoxime
empirically and received 2 doses however clinically worsensed so
broadened to vancomycin and cefepime on admission.  Suprapubic
catheter was changed on [**5-20**].  Urine cx showed mixed flora, but
likely culprit would be pan-sensitive E. coli from her blood
culture.  Abx narrowed to cipro prior to discharge (see above).

# AMS:  Likely [**12-19**] sepsis, improved back to baseline with
treatment as above.

# MS:  Pt followed by neurology for progressive MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **]
baclofen initially held in the setting of hypotension and
restarted on tarnsfer to floor.

# Recent PE: Prior PE in [**11-28**], was supposed to be on 6 month
course.  Given starting ciprofloxacin, would monitor INR more
closely.  INR on [**5-22**] was 2.1.  Plan to recheck on [**5-24**].  Please
address discontinuing anticoagulation as outpatient.

# Depression: Continued venlafaxine.

# Osteoporosis: Continued Calcium (has alendronate also weekly).

# Constipation: Continued her home bowel regimen.

# Intertrigo: Continued Nystatin topical powder on groin area.

# Communication: Patient & HCP patient's father [**Name (NI) 1193**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85418**]
# Code: DNR/DNI during admission

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old lady with 2 recent admissions for
COPD admitted via the ED from [**Hospital1 **] of [**Location (un) 55**] for
dyspnea. She was found to have labored breathing at [**Hospital1 **] with
desaturations to the 70s despite 3L nasal cannula. She was give
duoneb and did not improve wheezing/dyspnea. VS prior to
transfer: 98.4 77 154/86 28
.
In ED, vitals were 97.9, 18/69, 80, 24 100% on NRB. The patient
was reported to be awake and able to answer questions. She was
started on BiPAP, given Combivent, solumedrol 125mg IVx1, 500mL
NS and ASA. She was transferred to the ICU on 2L nasal cannula
(have successfully transitioned off BiPAP).
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient appears comfortable on 2L NC.
She is minimally responsive, answering only to loud voice and
correcting the pronounciation of her name. She is otherwise not
interactive, lying in a contracted position. A conversation with
her [**Hospital1 802**] (who was currently between flights back to [**Location (un) 86**],
expected to return tonight) confirmed that the patient is
conversant at baseline and has a history of erratic behavior
when ill, rather than unresponsiveness. She confirms that the
patient has had recent admissions for ""COPD"" flare and that she
has not been very well in the intervening time at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Per recent discharge summary ([**Date range (1) **] admission)
Diagnosed with COPD exacerbation as she finished her prior COPD
flare steroid taper. She was started on [**Hospital 48526**] transferred to the
ICU and was transitioned to NC. Her steroids were again tapered
rapidly and she is currently on a Prednisone taper (10mg dose)
from prior admission. The patient expressed paranoid thoughts
and was evaluated by Social work. This was ruled consistent with
her prior atypical psychosis.

Past Medical History:
- COPD with multiple intubations - h/o refusal to use steroids
or
BIPAP. Previously not on home O2 due to insurance issues.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old woman who was admitted for ??????COPD
flare?????? due to hypoxia and desaturation.  She likely has
restrictive physiology with reactive airways disase.  During the
course of her hospitalization she benefited most from sitting
upright while eating, being fed honey thickened liquids, and
receiving Divalproex Sodium Sprinkles (125 mg PO TID) that
seemed to steady her mental status.

Her course and treatment are as follows:

MICU Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after transitioning from
BiPAP to NC in the ED.  She arrived on NC, satting well and
breathing well but with evidence of hypoactive delerium.  She
was started on Prednisone, Azithromycin and home meds. Over her
first night she became agitated and required Haldol total 2mg.
In the am her mental status cleared and her respiratory status
remained stable with neb  stable on room air.  She was started
on a steroid taper with a fast inital component then slowing
once reaching what appears to be her critical dose of 15mg.
Given her month of steroids she has been started on Bactrim PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) 5**] as well. The patient was transferred to the floor stable on
room air.  On the floor, the patient had alternating episodes of
lucency and unresponsiveness, which, per report from her
extended care facility,  is a baseline mental status level.


1) Hypoxia/Dyspnea:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had two recent admissions
for ""COPD"" flare.  Although this diagnosis is questionable given
her lack of smoking history and other pulmonary disease, she
does have severe kyphosis that gives her a restrictive breathing
physiology with a possible reactive component that appears to
respond well to nebulizer, steroid taper, antibiotics and
repositioning.  Due to her alternating mental status, she would
probably not be able to tolerate/perform pulmonary function
tests therefore we will not be able to definitively rule out
COPD.  Other causes of her hypoxia such as flash cardiopulmonary
edema, infection, valvular disease and pulmonary embolism were
considered, however, these causes were less likely.  The
patient's oxygen saturation returned to her baseline saturations
of the low to mid 90s on room air after initiating nubulizer,
steroid therapy and repositioning her to a more upright sitting
position.  She was discharged from the hospital on a steroid
taper as outlined in her discharge instructions however we are
not certain that her pulmonary functioning is improving from
this treatment.  We encourage standing nebulizer treatment and
optimizing her positioning so as to improve her pulmonary
function.  We also reccommend her to have all meals sitting up
right and out of bed in order to prevent aspiration.

****Of note-Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an episode of suspected hypoxia one
day prior to discharge, however it was very difficult to get a
pleth tracing initially based on a finger monitoring.  Once
pleth tracing achieved, patient's o2 saturations were in the low
90s on room air, her baseline.  No supplemental o2 was given
during this episode.  Given this event and her history of
hypoxic episodes that are very short in nature, these episodes
could also be related to difficulty establishing o2 monitoring
as well positioning problems.  Recommend forehead monitoring of
o2 sat levels if possible.  This tactic might prevent future
hospitalizations.

2) Altered mental status/Psychosis: Mrs.[**Hospital 81202**] healthcare
proxy (her [**Hospital 802**]) was
contact[**Name (NI) **] during this admission as was her health care team at
[**Hospital1 **], each confirmed that during times of illness patient can
decompensate and become paranoid and
delusional. Per her HCP and long term nurse manager at [**Hospital1 **], at
baseline patient has moments of clarity but may relapse into
unresponsiveness in a matter of minutes. During this admission,
she was generally cooperative but was unresponsive on a couple
of occasions.  She received depakote sprinkles with good effect
and we reccommend that she be maintained on this medication.

3)  Hypertension: We continued her home anti hypertensives with
the exception of the nitroglycerin patch.  Her blood pressure
fluctuated during her course.  A more stable environment would
offer better insight as to what her optimal medication regimen
for this condition is.

4) Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient has CRI with baseline
hct ~ 1.6. Etiology unknown but presumably secondary to
hypertension.  Her medications were renally dosed and her urine
output was monitored.  She is at baseline incontinent so
monitoring her urine output was troublesome after removing her
foley upon transfer from the MICU.  Her creatine slowly trended
up and had a discharge level of 2.0.  Medication causes of this
trend are always possible but we did not change medications that
could have caused this rise.  Her PO intake was relatively good
but she could benefit from more PO fluids.  Recommend  to
re-check creatine in a couple of days.

5)  Anemia:  Her hematocrit ranged from the high 20s to the low
30s similar to her previous hospital courses.  Her anemia
appears to be related to her renal insufficiency.  She receives
monthly procrit for this condition.

6)  Eye ectropion:  the patient has right eye lid ectropion on
physical exam and she complains of right eye pain.  She would
benefit seeing an opthamologist to evaluate this condition.  In
the meantime she has been prescribed artificial tears to relieve
some of the pain associated with this condition.

)  FEN -  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] a low Na Diet and Honey
thickened liquids.  In fact she seem to do her best when eating
her meals.  She did not require any IV fluids while on the
floor. We recommend that she have all meals out of bed and in
upright manner to prevent aspiration.

PERTINENT STUDIES:

[**2173-2-27**] Radiology CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM
Rotated positioning. Previously seen left IJ catheter has been
removed. Left subclavian PICC line is present. The tip may be
partially obscured by the spinal hardware. However, I suspect it
is unchanged in position and likely lies at the SVC/RA junction.
No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is obscuration of the
left diaphragm and increased retrocardiac density. There is more
pronounced patchy opacity at the right base. Suspect mild
pulmonary vascular plethora.

[**2173-2-26**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Interval extubation. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, large
on the left and small on the right. Possible minimal pulmonary
edema.

[**2173-2-21**] Neurophysiology EEG
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of frequent bifrontal and parasagittal generalized periodic
epileptiform discharges. Although some of the bifrontal
discharges have triphasic features but, given their evolution,
these are most likely related to earlier epileptiform activity.
These findings are indicative of focal cortical irritability and
potential epileptogenicity predominantly in the bifrontal
regions. In addition, the background is diffusely slow and
disorganized indicative of moderate to severe encephalopathy.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there is improvement with
fewer blunted discharges and longer periods of disorganized
theta activity without bifrontal discharges.

[**2173-2-20**] Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS
1. Unchanged ventriculomegaly with associated cerebellar
atrophic
changes, with no evidence of transependymal migration of CSF.
Scattered foci of high signal intensity are identified in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
2. Chronic hydrocephalus, possibly communicating, is a
consideration, there is no evidence of leptomeningeal
enhancement to suggest arachnoiditis, the possibility of a
Dandy-Walker variant is also a consideration.
3. Unchanged opacity of the ethmoidal air cells and sphenoid
sinus suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process.

[**2173-2-20**] Cardiovascular ECHO
Poor image quality. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The RV is not well seen but
overall normal free wall contractility is probably normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


[**2173-2-20**] Neurophysiology EEG
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of
frequent generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) at
times as frequent as one to two per second. These do not
evolvefurther into non-convulsive status epilepticus. However,
these findings are indicative of severe cortical irritability
and potential epileptogenicity in a generalized distribution.
The backgroundtowards the later portion of the recording is
diffusely slow and disorganized indicative of moderate to severe
encephalopathy.

[**2173-2-19**] Radiology BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist
.
[**2173-2-18**] Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or other definite
acute process.
2. Moderate enlargement of all ventricles, more striking than
background cerebral atrophic changes, although cerebellar
atrophy is substantial. There is no hypodensity about the
ventricles to suggest transependymal edema.  Correlation with
clinical history is recommended and comparison to prior head CT,
if available, may be helpful to assess for chronicity. Major
differential considerations include chronic hydrocephalus,
probably communicating, associated with a prior inflammatory
process such as arachnoiditis or perhaps in association with a
congenital lesion such as Dandy-Walker variant.
3. Opacification of the left sphenoid sinus with bony thickening
suggesting longer chronicity and hyperdense material suggestive
of fungal colonization.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION
67 year old female with PMH of multiple sclerosis and
torticollis presenting from a long term care facility for
further evaluation of altered mental status and being
transferred to the ICU for likely urosepsis after intubation for
airway protection.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# Urosepsis: The patient has a known neurogenic bladder from her
underlying multiple sclerosis with a chronic indwelling Foley.
On admission, she was noted to be in septic shock with positive
UA, BP of 86/40 and altered mental status. Due to her
unresponsive state, she was intubated and placed on a vent in
the ED. Her septic shock was initally treated broadly with
vanco/cefepime/cipro; as further cultures came back, she was
discovered to have a Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus growing
from blood and urine.  She did not require any pressors during
her hospitalization. The day prior to her discharge from the ICU
she was noted to have increased tan secretions, increasing WBC
count, and low grade fever concerning for VAP. She was initated
on VAP protocol with Tobramycin and Zosyn in addition to her
Vancomycin for VSE. However, she was rapidly extubated and
transferred to the floor with improving clinical status.  All
BAL/sputum Cx returned negative for growth and decision was made
to discontinue VAP coverage.  Pt was switched to ampicillin
alone to complete a 14 day course for VSE urosepsis, last dose
[**3-4**] PM, then PICC line may be pulled.

# Respiratory Failure/VAP: She was intubated until 1 day prior
to her discharge from the ICU for concerns regarding her mental
status, as well as secretions. She was also a very difficult
intubation due to her torticollus. Given concern for VAP on [**2-25**]
in setting of with new tan secretions and leukocytosis, she was
started on tobramycin and zosyn in addition to vanco on [**2-25**]. She
was also started on hyoscyamine for secretions. Following
discharge from the ICU, patient's respiratory status was greatly
improved and she was satting well on room air. Given clinical
improvement and negative BAL cultures,  VAP coverage antibiotics
were discontinued.  Pt was monitored clinically on Ampicillin
alone for an additional 48hrs and remained afebrile with no new
respiratory symptoms, maintaining sats on RA.

# Altered Mental Status/Seizures: Patient noted on EEG
suggestive of non-convulsive status. Unclear how long patient
has been having seizures. An LP was performed, which was
predominately negative. Patient was started on acyclovir,
empirically. MRI showed chronic hydrocephalus and
ventriculomegaly with periventricular white matter changes.
Acyclovir was discontinued once CSF was negative for HSV.
Patient became much more alert and interactive following
extubation.  She was maintained on Keppra and Risperdal was
stopped. On transfer to the floor, patient was alert and
oriented x3. She was discharged at her baseline mental status.

# Goals of care: Patient a DNR/DNI, confirmed in discussion with
patient once extubated and lucid; son and HCP [**Name (NI) **] expressed
interest in the patient being made do not hospitalize with
palliative care. As of now, patient may be rehospitalized, but
the facility should contact [**Name (NI) **] prior to transferring her to
hospital. [**Doctor First Name **] was advised to follow up with facility if the
patient decides those are her wishes.

#. Sinus Tachycardia.  Patient had sinus tachycardia into the
120s while in the ICU. Patient was placed on lower dose
Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID while in the ICU. Prior to discharge,
metoprolol was increased to her home dose of 150mg daily and HR
remained in the 80s.

# CT read of fungal sinusitis: Per ENT, CT was suggestive of a
chronic process and not invasive fungal disease. ENT recommended
an outpatient follow-up for possible resection if symptomatic.
Currently, fungal ball is not symptomatic.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS

# Hydrocephalus: Chronic, no changes during hospitalization.

#. Multiple Sclerosis.  The patient has severe multiple
sclerosis with resultant muscle contractures; she has been
wheelchair bound since [**2166**], and has a neurogenic bladder
requiring chronic Foley. We continued her on some of her home
medications, but not all given concerns for her mental status.
Her baclofen was decreased to 5mg tid, and her bethanechol was
discontinued.

#. Chronic pain.  Seemingly related to contractures from
underlying multiple sclerosis. Patient denied pain during her
stay. We continued her on a lidoderm patch prn but have been
holding her home ibuprofen, MS Contin, tramadol, gabapentin and
voltaren gel.  She was doing well on this minimized regimen and
may not need this additional medications going forward.

#. HTN.  Held home lisinopril while in ICU in setting of
urosepsis. After transfer to the floor, her home dose of
lisinopril was restarted. Metoprolol was also started at a lower
dose (37.5  mg TID) until uptitration to her home dosing of
150mg Toprol daily prior to discharge.

#. Osteoporosis.  Held home alendronate.  Continued Calcium
supplementation.

#. Constipation.  Continued home docusate, senna, miralax.

#. Depression: Had been holding home medications given
intubation and altered mental status. Discontinued risperdol and
Tramadol given they can lower seizure threshold. We also held
her abilify and trazadone. We continued her citalopram.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Made a number of adjustments to her psychiatric and pain
medications. Would monitor closely
-Will need to complete 14 days of ampicillin to treat urosepsis
-Patient with apparent fungal ball in sinus on CT. Currently
asymptomatic. Would continue to monitor.
-Please talk to HCP and son [**Name (NI) **] before any major changes to
patient's goals of care
***If patient becomes febrile, develops productive cough or
worsening respiratory status, low threshold to initiate
Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo for 7 day course for HCAP treatment.***

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted because you had a severe
urinary tract infection which led to persistent seizures. You
were treated in the intensive care unit, and you were intubated
for several days. You were started on IV antibiotics to treat
your infection and started on levetiracetam (Keppra) to control
the seizures. Once these were controlled, you were transferred
to the floor, and we watched you for a few days while we
adjusted your medications. At this time, it is safe for you to
return home. You should follow up with your neurologist as
scheduled below.

He was last seen well at 9 pm when he went to bed.  This morning
she had difficulty waking him up.  Then, he began having shaking
of his upper extremities which lasted about 2 minutes.  When EMS
arrived, he was unresponsive, pupils were pinpoint and so he was
given Narcan.  He was taken to [**Hospital6 **].  He was
noted to be minimally responsive, occasionally groaning to
verbal
stimuli.  Head CT was done which did not show acute process.
Chest X-ray shows a left lower lobe infiltrate.  He was given
Ceftriaxone 1 g and Vancomycin 1 g.   When he arrived to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED, he was responsive to tactile stimuli but non verbal, moving
all extremities, and unable to follow commands.  He had another
seizure with desaturation to 78%.  He received Ativan 2 mg and
dilantin 1 g.  He was intubated.  He was noted to be
hyponatremic
(Na 121) and was given 100 ml 3% NaCl.

He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2112-5-13**] with
encephalopathy and tactile and visual hallucinations.  He was
found to have MRSA positive UTI which was treated with a course
of vancomycin.  After treatment for the UTI, his behavior and
hallucinations recovered.  During that admission, he had
episodes
of falling asleep while talking.  He was evaluated for seizure
with EEG which was negative for seizure.

On review of systems, the wife reports for fever, headache,
nausea, or vomiting.

Pertinent Results:
MRI:
1. Negative susceptibility foci in the left parietal region
limit assessment of the details in the adjacent brain
parenchyma. Study is also limited due to motion on some
sequences. Within this limitation, there is no large area of
decreased diffusion to suggest an acute infarct or obvious area
of abnormal enhancement to suggest a mass lesion. Follwo up as
clinically indicated.

2. Unchanged appearance of the small FLAIR hyperintense foci in
the centrum semiovale and in the periventricular location in the
parietal lobes on both sides, a few in the right frontal lobe
without associated enhancement, representing the previously
noted demyelinating lesions.

3. Coronal MP-RAGE and T2 sequences are limited due to motion.
The left
hippocampus is slightly smaller than the right on some of the
images, however, the significance of this finding is not
certain. To correlate with EEG.  Evaluation for other structural
abnormalities is limited due to the suboptimal quality. This can
be repeated when the patient is cooperative, if necessary.

4. pl. see prior CTA for details reg. intracranial arteries- ?
mild decreased in enhancement/size of the M2 branches diffusely
and bilaterally without flow limiting stenosis/occlusion.

5. Mucosal thickening with fluid in the ethmoid, maxillary and
frontal
sinuses as described above.

EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to the presence of
an unreactive, extremely low voltage [**2-15**] Hz delta frequency
background.
However, compared to the previous recording, the background
appears of
slightly higher voltage consistent with a slight improvement.
This
pattern is consistent with a severe diffuse encephalopathy.
There were
no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
SEPSIS

[**Known firstname 4580**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the neuro-ICU after he became less
responsive and had shaking movements. He was found to be
hypotensive and hypothermic and was intubated for concern of
repiratory protection. He was in the neuro-ICU and had an LP,
blood cultures and a bronch that were not revealing. He had
urine cultures from before admission that were significant for
yeast >100,000 colonies. He was treated with a full course of
Zosyn, Vancomycin and Fluconazole. He was extubated and had some
dysarthria secondary to vocal cord edema. He was seen by PT and
felt to be at his baseline. He was discharged home with VNA to
check on his [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 54192**] Foley. He was asked to follow up
with neurology, infectious disease (for his persistent
infections), and urology (for a more long-term solution to his
[**Known lastname 54192**] Foley).

He was started on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for the concern of
seizures. He had a 24-hour EEG that was recorded as low voltage

[**Known lastname 54192**] foley and  [**Known lastname 16169**] UTIs who presents with
urosepsis.
.
## Klebsiella Urosepsis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital **] after developing lethargy, hypotension, and
hypothermia. He received 1g Vanc and 1g ceftriaxone prior to
transfer.  n arrival here the patient was HD stable. Received 1L
IVF. Given a warming blanket for hypothermia. Mental status
improved and was answering questions. Admitted to the ICU for
hypothermia. In the ICU, the patient remained HD stable.
Switched to meropenem based on [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] urine culture
growing ESBL Klebsiella. Transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2112-12-21**].  On the floor the patient was hypothermic with
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. Placed on warming blanket and
vancomycin started. The following day the patient was febrile.
Transferred back to the ICU where the patient continued to be HD
stable.  Continued on vancomycin and meropenem and transferred
back to the [**Hospital1 **] on [**2112-12-23**].  He continued to improve
clinically from this point.  His WBC fell, however, and given a
prior question of whether vancomycin was causative, this was
discontinued as there were no culture results revealing any MRSA
infection, and clinical evidence of ongoing possible hospital
associated pneumonia was limited (no sob, fevers, chest pain,
cough). His cell counts recovered immediately after cessation of
the Vancomycin. Home IV therapy has been arranged so that he can
complete a total 14-day course of Meropenem via PICC line.
.
## Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia: This was attributed to
Vancomycin as stated above, which improved after Vancomycin was
stopped.
.
## Seizure disorder: During the hospitalization it was
recognized that medications initiated in the ICU and continued
on the floor had several errors as his home medication regimen
was identified to be different that the list maintained in OMR.
He was erroneously receiving keppra with dilantin, when he was
suppposed to be on dilantin alone. This was explained to him and
his wife, and apology offered and accepted. No evident harm
resulted, and the Keppra was discontinued and the medication
list corrected and all providers involved notified of the error
that was collectively made.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 M with h/o multiple sclerosis, neurogenic
bladder w/ [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 54192**] foley w/ h/o MRSA and ESBL E. coli
UTIs, and seizures who presented to ED with weakness and
lethargy.  The patient was recently admitted (discharged on the
16th), with ESBL E. coli urosepsis, treated with meropenum x 14d
(finished course on [**1-4**]), started developing weakness and
lethary and mild confusion simliar to his prior UTIs.  As per
the patient's wife, the patient started becoming more lethargic
and weak three days prior to admission, with difficulty sitting
up in wheelchair.  She reports that he was having a good urine
output and good appetite, so didn't think much of it.  However,
the day prior to admission, the patient's wife notes that he was
confused and could not remember where his granddaughter lived,
prompting her to bring him to the hospital.  The patient reports
that in days preceding hospitalization, he felt generally well.
But reports lethargy and fatigue since last hospitalization.
.
Of note, he has had 3 prior hospitalizations this year for UTI,
encephalopathy, and transaminitis ([**Month (only) 547**]); neuro ICU for sepsis
with unresponsiveness and ""shaking"" ([**Month (only) 116**]); and ESBL E.coli
urosepsis ([**Month (only) **]).  His urine cultures in the past have grown
MRSA, [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis, and E.coli.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98 84 76/48 18 98%. Patient was
given linezolid 600mg and imipenem 2g for broad coverage and
allergy to Vancomycin (pancytopenia).  UA was positive, but no
bacteria present. Because the patient was altered, LP was also
attempted numerous times, but without any success.  The patient
was hypothermic by rectal temperature on warming blanket and
Bair hugger, was triggered for hypotension, and did not respond
to 3+L NS; CVL placed, and Levophed started in the ED.  He was
hypoglycemic to 55, given [**2-14**] [**Last Name (un) **] D50.  In total, received 5-6L
NS in the ED.
.
On transfer to the MICU, the patient's vitals 98, 131/65, 18,
99% 4L, on 0.05 levophed drip.  The patient was sleeping
comfortably on arrival to the MICU, denying any pain.

ORGANISMS/ML..
[**1-16**] Urine culture: final, no growth
[**1-18**] urine culture: >100K colonies GPCs, likely alpha-hemolytic
strep or lactobacillus
[**1-14**] Blood culture: final, no growth
12/5,7 Blood cultures: pending, NGTD

IMAGING:
[**1-14**] CXR:
There are low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is
appreciated
on this limited view. A small left pleural effusion would be
difficult to
exclude. Compared to prior exam, there is decreased prominence
of the
pulmonary vasculature. There has been interval removal of a
left-sided PICC.Exam is otherwise unchanged. Slightly prominent
loops of air-filled colon are again noted under the right
hemidiaphragm.

[**1-17**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. No evidence of abscess. Small amount of simple free fluid
adjacent to the cecum.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Trabeculated bladder with pseudodiverticulum, likely sequela
of neurogenic bladder.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
5. Nonobstructing right renal stone. No hydronephrosis or
masses.

[**1-19**] CXR:
Right PICC tip is malpositioned, crosses midline and the tip is
in the left
subclavian vein. The catheter can be pulled back 10 cm to be at
the junction of the brachiocefalic veins. There is no evident
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are low lung volumes.
Bibasilar atelectases have increased from [**1-14**]. Cardiac
size is top normal.
(PICC repositioned by IR following this CXR)

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with multiple sclerosis (MS), neurogenic
bladder with [**Month (only) **] [**Month (only) 54192**] foley and [**Month (only) 16169**] urinary
tract infections (UTIs), recently admitted three weeks ago with
ESBL E.coli UTI, who presented with weakness/lethargy,
consistent with past episodes of urosepsis.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Presumed urosepsis:  The patient presented with weakness and
lethargy, consistent with initiating symptoms of urosepsis, as
per the patient's wife. [**Name (NI) 227**] the patient's history and [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 54192**] Foley for spastic bladder, likely urinary source of
infection.  Initial urinalysis with 151 WBC, but urine culture
grew only yeast.  Foley was changed on arrival.  In the past has
grown MRSA and ESBL E. coli from urine.  Chest xray with no
obvious infiltrate.  He was treated with Meropenum and linezolid
given historical infections and pancytopenia last admission with
vancomcyin treatment.  The patient's white count subsequently
trended down, so linezolid was discontinued.  He was continued
on just meropenem and his mental status and blood pressure
improved.  He had a subsequent urine culture that grew GPCs,
likely alpha hemolytic strep or lactobacillus.  It was unclear
at the time if these were true pathogens or colonizers, but no
antibioitic change was made because meropenem would cover these
organisms as well.  A PICC was placed on [**1-18**], and he was
discharged to home with the plan to complete 8 more days of
ertapenem (switched for ease of daily dosing) for a total 14 day
course of carbapenem antibiotics.

# Neurogenic bladder, [**Month/Day (4) **] UTIs:  Has been hospitalized now
3x this year for likely UTIs.  Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his outpatient
urologist, during his hospitalization.  He will plan to see him
after this acute illness resolves and pull his foley, have him
fitted for a condom cath, and recieve botox injections to the
bladder.  In the meantime, his foley was changed and he will
continue to need a foley until his illness resolves.

# Pancytopenia:  Has had pancytopenic reaction to vancomycin in
the past, noted to have downtrending WBC count during this stay
while on linezolid.  Thought to be due to the linezolid, however
could be marrow suppression from sepsis.  His counts began to
normalize after stopping the linezolid and with his clinical
improvement.
.
# Transaminitis:  Patient's transaminitits elevated from
baseline on admission, initially thought to be possibly
secondary to hypotension with some element of shock liver.  His
statin was held as a precautionary measure, and his liver
enzymes trended back down to normal as his clinical status
improved.
.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Multiple sclerosis: Continued home Baclofen 20 mg TID,
Oxybutynin 2.5 mg TID
.
# Seizure disorder: Continued Dilantin 200 mg qhs.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Held Simvastatin 10 mg qhs because of
transaminitis.  Can consider restarting as an outpatient.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Follow up urology recommendations about [**Last Name (STitle) **] suppressive
therapy
- Statin restarted on DC-- may consider re-checking LFTs at next
visit
- follow up final result of blood cultures from [**1-16**], [**1-18**]

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
sleepiness and fevers.  We think that you had bacteria spreading
from an infection in your urine into your blood which caused
these symptoms.  You were treated with antibiotics and lots of
fluids in your IV and your blood pressure slowly got better and
your sleepiness improved.  You will need to continue the
antibiotic for a week after you leave the hospital

The following changes were made to your medications:
START ertapenem antibiotic daily.
START a bowel regimen with senna, colace and bisacodyl to help
with constipation.

Continue all of your other prior medications.
.
It is also very important that you keep all of your follow-up
appointments listed below.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!

History of Present Illness:
68M w/ MS, [**First Name3 (LF) 45870**] bladder, [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**First Name3 (LF) 54192**] foley
catheter, [**First Name3 (LF) **] UTI in [**2113-2-12**], MRSA+ presents with increasing
malaise, change in mental status similar to prior UTI per wife.
[**Name (NI) **] was treated for [**Name (NI) **] UTI w/ Linezolid in [**Month (only) 404**].  Recently,
had similar symptoms (decreased responsiveness, alertness and
less verbal than baseline with UTIs) and was treated with 7 days
of Macrobid without improvement. This was changed to oral
Linezolid for past 4 days and he has not improved.  Becoming
difficult to care for, and has had decreased PO intake, malaise
and is less responsive.

In ED was afebrile and normotensive on arrival, but repeat BP
84/55.  He received a 1.5L bolus (total 3L in ED) and SBP back
up to 120-140s.  By 1420p when I spoke with ED physician about
his case, he had not yet been given any antibiotics (because
patient not tolerating the Linezolid pill that was ordered).
The ED staff reportedly spoke with ID fellow who had suggested
to continue Linezolid for the present.  I requested that they
cover for gram negative organisms prior to transfer to medical
[**Hospital1 **] given his risks, his clinical failure on Linezolid and lack
of adequate gram negative coverage with Linezolid.  He then
developed hypothermia in the ED who communicated that he might
need a bear-hugger, and he was only getting Linezolid.  I paged
the ER attending.  I paged the ED resident and again requested
immediate gram negative coverage since he now meets SIRS/SEPSIS
criteria with presumptive urosepsis, and concern for ICU needs.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45870**] bladder frequently admitted with
resistant UTIs admitted to MICU for hypotension & profound
hypothermia secondary to a [**Last Name (Titles) **] UTI for which he had already
started po therapy as an outpatient.  Subsequent hospital course
was complicated by metabolic encephalopathy which largely
cleared prior to discharge.
.
# UTI / [**Last Name (Titles) **] Bladder / Sepsis / Hypothermia: PCP??????s office
confirmed [**Last Name (Titles) **] on urine culture from [**3-24**], sensitive to macrobid
and linezolid. Initially he was treated with macrobid and
worsened significantly. He transiently responded to linezolid,
but eventually came to the hospital minimally interactive and
hypothermic.  Cefepime was added on in the MICU and linezolid
was continued.  He was warmed artificially and improved
significantly.  All cultures from this admission returned
negative: cefepime was discontinued on [**4-4**] and linezolid was
continued until [**4-9**] to complete a two week course. He will
follow-up with Infectious Disease to discuss further options to
prevent [**Month/Year (2) 16169**] UTIs.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: Per wife, has been worsening over the last
few months with each recurrence of UTI. Palliative care and SW
were consulted. Hospice options were presented to the patient
and his wife & daughter. The patient was receptive to the idea
of comfort focused care and avoiding futuere hospitalizations,
but states that at this time he is not ready for hospice.
Baclofen was continued.
.
# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: Cleared on the medical floor
as the patient recovered. By the time of discharge, he was near
his recent baseline.
.
# Seizure Disorder: Continued phenytoin.
.
# Mood disorder NOS: Recently started on sertraline as an
outpatient. However, concurrent linezolid puts him at risk for
serotonin syndrome. Setraline was held throughout the admission
and the patient was advised to continue holding this medication
until at least a week after completing linezolid.  Consideration
should be given to indefinite discontinuation of SSRIs as he may
require linezolid again.
.
# Moderate Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to linezolid. Because
of this, would favor daptomycin to cover [**Month/Year (2) **] UTIs in the future.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were admitted with a severe infection which caused
hypothermia and low blood pressure.  We think that this was
caused by another UTI. You were treated with antibiotics,
fluids, and medications which were necessary to maintain your
blood pressure.

You were seen by consultants from infectious disease and
palliative care.  You should continue to take linezolid for one
more day after discharge, your last dose should be on [**4-9**].

We are holding sertraline because it interacts wil linezolid.
You should continue to hold sertraline for at least a week after
finishing linezolid because these medications can cause a severe
reaction when taken together. We have not changed any of your
other previous medications. Please continue to take them as you
did previously. A full list has been attached.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your PCP's office on monday to schedule an
appointment within the next week.

You will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by someone from the Division of Infectious
Disease regarding a follow-up apopointment. If you do not hear
from them, please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6732**].

Imaging:
Head CT [**11-26**]:
There is a large mixed density but predominantly hyperdense
left-sided subdural hematoma extending approximately 23 mm from
the inner table with
moderate mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma resulting
in
approximately 10 mm of rightward subfalcine herniation but
without significant uncal herniation or transtentorial
herniation. Small amount of blood is likely also layering along
the left tentorium and adjacent to the falx. There is an
underlying chronic small vessel ischemic disease with
periventricular white matter hypoattenuating changes extending
into the corona radiata bilaterally. No intraparenchymal
hemorrhage or intraventricular hemorrhage is identified. No
hydrocephalus is noted, although there is expected mass effect
on the left-sided frontal,temporal, and occipital horns. The
globes are intact with no significant soft tissue edema noted.
No underlying bony fractures are present. Mild mucosal
thickening is noted within the ethmoid air cells bilaterally,
and there is bilateral circumferential mucosal thickening within
the maxillary sinuses. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are well aerated. A large amount of cerumen is present
within the external auditory canals bilaterally. Small polyp is
also present within the sphenoid sinus.

CXR [**11-27**]:
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Exam positioning is somewhat limited
due to
lordotic technique. Given these limitations, the exam still
appears normal
without evidence of pneumothorax, pneumonia, edema, or pleural
effusions.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within
normal limits.

No displaced rib fractures are identified with chronic grade 3
right AC
seperation with heterotopic bone formation noted.

CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE [**11-26**]:
The degree of lumbar lordosis is somewhat accentuated but there
is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. No
prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified. Multilevel
degenerative changes consisting with anterior and posterior
osteophytes as well as disc space narrowing and irregularity is
present most marked at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 interspaces. Anterior
well corticated osseous fragments are also likely degenerative
in nature. Visualized soft tissues are unremarkable. Visualized
contents of the intrathecal sac is somewhat limited on CT
examination and displays expected mass effect of the adjacent
thecal sac related to disc osteophyte complexes most pronounced
at the C5-C6 interspace where the entire ventral thecal sac
appears effaced. Visualized lung apices are clear with mild
centrilobular emphysematous changes noted.

CT Brain [**11-28**]:  Mild interval increase hyperdense material
along the left frontal extra-axial space consistent with likely
increased subdural bleeding; small epidural bleeding.

CT Brain [**11-30**]: Mild interval improvement in the amount of
pneumocephalus with persistent bilateral low-density extradural
collections. Soft tissue post-surgical changes at the craniotomy
site are unchanged. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

MRI [**2141-1-16**]:
FINDINGS: This single sequence is compared with the multiplanar
post-contrast MR examination obtained the preceding day, which
was extremely motion-limited, as well as the more diagnostic
study of [**2141-1-6**]. There is persistent thick dural enhancement
overlying the left cerebral convexity and along the anterior
aspect of the falx, as on that study, likely related to previous
left frontoparietotemporal craniotomy. The enhancing lesions in
the right parietal corona radiata and at the superficial left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, demonstrated on the
T1-weighted spin echo sequence on [**1-6**] are not seen as such on
the present examination; however, at these sites, there are now
faint rim-enhancing lesions with low, relatively hypointense
centers, with an overall appearance consistent with active
demyelinative plaques. This is in the context of innumerable
T1-hypointense ovoid and round lesions, oriented roughly
perpendicularly to the long-axis of the lateral ventricles.
Allowing for the limited nature of this study, no new enhancing
lesion is identified.

IMPRESSION: Limited pre-operative study, with:
1. The more uniformly enhancing superficial left frontal and
right corona
radiata lesions now appear as rim-enhancing, predominantly
T1-hypointense
abnormalities. In the context of the numerous round and ovoid
low-signal
foci,in a pattern most suggestive of underlying demyelinative
disease
(consistent with the apparently known diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis), these two lesions likely represent foci of more
active demyelination.
2. Relatively uniform frontoparietal dural thickening and
enhancement
overlying the left cerebral convexity, likely related to
previous craniotomy.

CT scan [**2141-1-16**]:
FINDINGS: There is a right parietal craniotomy defect with right
frontal
pneumocephalus and air in the right lateral ventricle frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] is within the spectrum of post-surgical change. There is no
evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage with minimal
left extra-axial fluid collection/meningeal thickening
representing the residua of prior subdural hemorrhage that is
unchanged since five hours prior. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in caliber and configuration. Extensive bihemispheric
white matter hypodensities likely correspond to known multiple
sclerosis. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
grossly unremarkable, except to note minimal maxillary sinus
thickening.

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings are within the spectrum of post-surgical change. No
acute
cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Extensive bihemispheric white matter hypodensities likely
correspond to
known multiple sclerosis.
3. Minimal left extra-axial fluid collection/ meningeal
thickening likely
represents the residua of prior subdural hemorrhage, unchanged
since five
hours prior.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a left sided craniotomy for subdural
removal. Post operatively he was extubated, follow up CT scan
showed decrease size of subdural and pneumocephlus. He was
noticed not to be moving his right side as well as left, a
second CT was unchanged he would withdraw his right arm to
nailbed pressure only. On POD#2 his exam continued to be
obtunded with eye opening only to pain and continued weakness on
left side though his legs seem to be moving more than the
previous day and nursing reported more sponteous movement on
right side. He was started on tube feeds and mobilized. While he
was on the step down unit he acutely desaturated and
decompensated requiring emergent endotracheal intubation and
transferred to the ICU. He [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a bronchoscopy and was
found to have aspirated tube feeding content into the bronchus.
Subsequently he began spiking fevers. On [**12-3**] Sputum cultures
resulted positive as the pt continued to produce copious amounts
of thick yellow secretions. Pt continued on Vancomycin,Zosyn and
Cipro for full course of treatment. He remained in ICU, wound
was well healed, staples removed. Neuro exam showed following
commands inconsistenetly with R UE. Head CTs followed during
hospital stay showed interval improvement.

Successful extubation occurred [**12-9**]. He was transferred to
stepdown. Evaluated on multiple attempts by speech and swallow
and failed trials requiring feeding tube placement. He did move
all 4 extremities - though less in L leg but did not follow
motor commands though he did nod to questions.  He was abulic.
He was evaluated by psychiatry for possible depression and
competency. They felt that he was not competent to make his own
decisions.  On [**12-16**] he was able to take some food PO. On [**12-20**] he
was transferred to floor status. Legal dept worked on
guardianship throughout hospital stay. His legal guardian is
[**Name (NI) 11923**] [**Name (NI) **].

During the week of [**12-24**] his diet was advanced to thin liquids
and pureed diet on [**12-26**] he had a video swallow and his diet was
again advanced to ground solids. The tube feeds were eventually
stopped and the feeding tube was removed.

On [**1-5**] there was right orbital redness and erythromycin was
started. Per psych recommendations, methylphenidate was started.
He became more engaged. His dobhoff was replaced for poor
calorie counts.

The neurology team was consulted because the patient's overall
mental status was not improving significantly. They recommended
an MRI, which showed new brain lesions on [**1-7**]. A steriotactic
biopsy was planned. Prior to the surgery emergency guardianship
was obtained in order to obtain consent. The steriotactic biopsy
was done on [**2141-1-16**] and it indicated that the mass was an MS
lesion but the final pathology report is pending at time of
discharge. The patient was known to have MS prior to being
hospitalized.

He is currently eating with supervision. PT and OT agree with
discharge to rehab. His legal guardian agrees with discharge to
rehab on [**2141-1-19**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 13304**] is an 88 year old male with a history of CAD
s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA), porcine AVR '[**85**], DM2, HTN,
and MS who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on [**3-16**] for
prehydration prior to planned intervention to LIMA-LAD.  On
[**2194-2-9**], the patient presented to [**Hospital3 417**] with chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion and was found to have NSTEMI.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath on [**2-11**] and found to have LMCA
30%, LAD 80% into the diag, occluded distally, LCx/RCA occluded,
LIMA-LAD patent with 90% at touchdown into D2, SVG-PDA patent
with 70% PDA lesion.  The SVG-OM had a 90% stenosis; this was
intervened upon on [**2-14**].  Following the intervention on [**2-14**] he
developed creatinine elevation to 1.8.  He was discharged on [**2-19**]
with plans to return today for LIMA-LAD intervention.
.
During PTCA with atherectomy, patient sustained a small
dissection of his native LAD.  LAD angiography showed severe
calcified disease into a large diag which was not able to be
crossed with balloon.  A rotablator was used and resulted in a
small perforation.  PTCA was performed which resulted in 20%
residual with normal flow and sealing of dissection.  He had an
echocardiogram during catheterization which showed no signs of
effusion or tamponade.  He is transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring.
.
On admission to the CCU, the patient is chest pain free.  He
denies shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations,
orthopnea.  He is lying comfortably in bed.

.
Echo ([**2194-3-18**])
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with anteroseptal and anterior walls best preserved
(LVEF = 30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13304**] is a 88 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, AVR '[**85**], DM2,
HTN who presented for PTCA of LIMA-LAD and D1. His procedure was
successful but complicated by small perforation in the diag
coronary artery with the rotablator.
.
#. CAD: s/p CABG '[**78**] and NSTEMI in [**2194-2-9**] admitted for staged
PTCA of LIMA-LAD/D1.  He was prehydrated with bicarb and NAC
prior to catheterization.  During procedure a small perforation
occurred in the diagonal with rota wire which was balloon
tamponaded with no signs of bleeding or dissection after. An
echocardiogram performed during catheterization showed no
pericardial effusion. He was monitored overnight in the CCU and
showed no signs of hemodynamic instability or tamponade. A
repeat TTE done the next day again showed no pericardial
effeusion. He was continued on his ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, and
Imdur with good control of his HR and BP. He will follow up with

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Before final separation from bypass, the tissue valve was tested
and found to have unacceptably high regurgitation associated
with the right cusp. The aorta was re-clamped and the valve
inspected. Tried to wean again, and again too much AI at the
right cusp. Finally re-clamped and placed a mechanical valve.

Post-CPB: A mechanical aortic valve is in place. No AI, no
peri-valvular leak. Mean gradient = 11. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 66799**]r systolic fxn. Aorta intact. Other parameters as
pre-bypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from MWMC to cardiac surgery. She was
cleared for surgery by dental. She was taken to the operating
room on [**3-10**] where she underwent an AVR. She was transferred to
the ICU in stable condition. She was extubated later that same
day. She was given 48 hours of vancomycin since she was in the
hospital preoperatively. She was started on coumadin for her
mechanical valve.She was transfused 1 unit for HCT 24 with
oliguria and hypotension. She continued to require a neo gtt.
Her chest tubes had air leaks and were dc'd on POD #3. She was
weaned from her neo and transferred to the floor. She had SVT
and was seen by electrophysiology. She was started on
amiodarone. Her INR was therapeutic and she was ready for
discharge home. Pre-discharge xray showed a moderate left
effusion. Thoracentesis for 500 cc bloody fluid was performed.
Post-tap xray was improved and she was ready for discharge home.
Coumadin will be followed by the [**Hospital1 **] heart center coumadin
clinic.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-5-30**] 2:35 PM

Comparison is made with study performed at 455 hours on the same
day.

The size of the acute left parietal subdural hematoma is
unchanged. A low-density right frontal extra-axial collection is
also unchanged. There is soft tissue swelling in the right
frontal region. Ventricles and sulci are stable and age
appropriate.

No bony abnormality is seen. Scattered ethmoid opacification is
noted.

IMPRESSION:

No change in size of subdural hematoma.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-5-31**] 9:47 AM
CT HEAD: The size of the acute left parietal subdural hematoma
is unchanged. A low-density right frontal extra-axial collection
appears slightly more prominent, though without new hyperdense
material, which is consistent with a hygroma. Soft tissue
swelling along the right frontal region is improved compared to
the earliest study; however, there appears to be new left
temporal soft tissue swelling. No underlying fracture is seen.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid and left
maxillary sinuses along with opacification of some of the
ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION: Acute left parietal subdural hematoma, unchanged.
Slight increase in right frontal low-density collection,
consistent with hygroma. New left temporal soft tissue swelling,
without evidence of underlying fracture.

CT LOW EXT W/O C RIGHT  [**2165-5-30**] 2:35 PM
FINDINGS:

Numerous comminuted fractures are present throughout the right
mid and hind foot.

Multiple comminuted fractures of the first, second, and third
metatarsal bases, with lateral and dorsal dislocation of the
second metatarsal base, are consistent with a Lisfranc
fracture-dislocation. The fracture at the base of the second
metatarsal also extends into the metatarsal shaft. The medial
and lateral cuneiforms also demonstrate extensively comminuted
fractures. At the medial cuneiform, a large fracture fragment is
inferomedially displaced. The middle cuneiform is relatively
intact, with only several small avulsion fragments.

Through the body of the cuboid, there is an oblique, comminuted
fracture. The navicular is spared, and intact. The calcaneus
demonstrates a longitudinal, moderately anteromedially displaced
fracture along its plantar surface. The talus is intact, without
fracture. The ankle mortise is symmetric, and the distal tibia
and fibula are intact.

Finally, an oblique, intra-articular fracture extends across the
base of the fourth proximal phalanx. The remaining phalanges are
spared.

Extensive soft tissue edema and fat stranding is present
circumferentially about the hind, mid, and forefoot. There is no
evidence of soft tissue entrapment in any of the fracture
fragments. Supporting muscles and tendons are largely
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with Lisfranc fracture-dislocation, with
lateral displacement of the 2nd-5th metatarsals, but without
displacement of the first metatarsal. Extensively comminuted
fractures of the 1st-3rd metatarsal bases, the medial and
lateral cuneiforms, and the cuboid. Additional fractures of the
fourth metatarsal base, the calcaneus and the fourth proximal
phalanx.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Because of her injuries
Neurosurgery and Orthopedics were consulted. She was taken to
the operating room for right femoral percutaneous placement of
inferior vena cava filter, irrigation and debridement open
fracture and open reduction internal fixation of Lisfranc
fracture with percutaneous K-wires. There were no intraoperative
complications. She was placed in a bivalve cast on her right leg
and is non weight bearing on that extremity.

Her small left subdural was managed non operatively, she was
loaded with Dilantin and will need to remain on this for a total
of 10 days. She remained in a hard cervical collar because of
the C7 transverse process fracture. An MRI was done to assess
for ligamentous injury; this was ruled out, the cervical collar
was removed.

Postoperatively she remained in the Trauma ICU for several days
and was then transferred to the regular nursing unit. She was
initially on IV narcotics for pain control and was later changed
to long acting narcotics with shorter acting ones for
breakthrough pain. Her pain was adequately controlled with this
regimen.

She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy who have
recommended rehab following her acute hospital stay. She was
also seen by Social work for her alcohol related issues
surrounding the motor vehicle crash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 45957**] is a 48 year old male w/ PMH of multiple sclerosis who
was admitted to the Trauma service; in the ED he was noted with
tension pneumothorax upon arrival and received a chest tube. He
was taken to the operating room for trauma laparotomy secondary
to multiple stab wounds; 35 enterotomies were found in his small
intestine and were oversewn. He was rewarmed in the unit and
taken back to the OR for exploration of 3 stab wounds to his
neck.

Head CT showed intraventricular hemorrhage and a neurosurgical
consult was obtained. It was felt that this bleed did not
require surgical management. Serial head CT scans were followed
and the initial follow up scan did reveal an increase in the
intraventricular hemorrhage. His neurologic status was watched
closely, a repeat head CT on the next day remained stable with
no interval increase. Presently his mental status is that he is
alert, oriented x2-3, with some short term memory loss; and he
is cooperative with his care. He will follow up as an outpatient
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] for repeat head imaging.

During his hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname 45957**] was seen by Psychiatry and
his meds were adjusted to decrease agitation and avoid sedation.
 He was seen by Ophthalmology, Plastics, and Neurology for
damage to his right eye which prevents him from opening the lid,
although he has preserved vision. An MR of his head and orbits
were done which did show a right inferior rectus muscle into the
fracture defect. Plastics felt that this was caused by superior
orbital fissure syndrome and recommended that he see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2398**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 2576**] for evaluation and treatment in the next
several weeks.  No procedures were done in the hospital for his
eye; he was prescribed eye drops.

While in the hospital, he was treated with
vancomycin/Cipro/Zosyn for fever and altered mental status.  He
had a fever work-up which revealed pan-sensitive E. coli in his
urine.  He completed a course of Cipro and antibiotics were
discontinued.
On HD # 18 he acutely developed nausea and vomiting requiring an
NGT placement.  A CT scan of his abdomen confirmed a
post-operative mechanical obstruction. He was taken back to the
operating [**2126-7-16**] for laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
He was admitted back to the floor and made NPO with NGT and
maintained on IVF. On POD 1 the NGT was removed and his diet was
slowly advanced as tolerated. He is currently tolerating a
regular diet.

He was followed by Social work due to the nature of his trauma.
He was also evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and
is being recommended for short term rehab following his acute
hospital stay.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 y/o male in previously good health until
approximately 2 weeks prior to admission. While down in [**Location (un) 80056**] in [**Month (only) 216**] visiting his children when he developed some
left sided-weakness and numbness.  He underwent a brain biopsy
at a [**Hospital 5170**] hospital on [**2147-10-5**] which revealed a preliminary
DX of grade II Astrocytoma. The pt was then transferred to an
[**Hospital 26110**] rehab facility  via Medivac (due to the hurricane) on
[**2147-10-8**]. He subsequently was  discharged on [**2147-10-14**].  From there
he while traveling to [**Location (un) 86**], MA he developed acute shortness of
breath on [**2147-10-14**], Upon landinghe was taken to an outside ED and
later transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  where he was intubated for airway
protection and dyspnea. He was found to have a small PE. While
in [**Hospital1 18**] ED his neurologic status and exam deteriorated.  He
became more lethargic, not following commands, and without
spontaneous speech. Physical exam revealed a dense left
hemiplegia.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
BIOPSY: Brain, frontal lobe, right, biopsy:  Subcortical white
matter with sharply demarcated zones of demyelination.  See
note.  Note: Luxol fast blue and Bodian stains show sharply
demarcated areas of demyelination with preserved axons.
Immunohistochemical stains for CD68 and CD3 show dense
infiltration of macrophages and scattered T cells in areas of
demyelination.  Immunostain for SV40 ([**Male First Name (un) 2326**] virus) is negative.
These findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis in the
appropriate clinical context.

Imaging:
CTA Chest([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Small peripheral pulmonary embolus within the right
lower lobe.

Head CT([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Extensive edema of the hemispheres, with involvement
of the
corpus callosum, compatible with the reported history of
glioblastoma
multiforme.

LE Ultrasound ([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.

MRI Head ([**10-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bifrontal vasogenic edema with two small foci of
enhancement.
Findings are nonspecific and may correspond to the reportedly
biopsy-proven glioblastoma multiforme. Given the overall paucity
of enhancement, hemorrhage or necrosis, however, lymphoma
remains a distinct possibility.
2. Small amount of blood products along the right frontal lobe
biopsy tract.
3. Unusual pattern of non-enhancing uniform T1- and
T2-hyperintensity
confined to the right basal ganglia, of unclear etiology, but
likely secondary to the adjacent extensive tumor and peritumoral
edema, perhaps on the basis of altered perfusion (though there
is no evidence of frank infarction); a less likely consideration
is direct tumor infiltration.
COMMENT: Focused MRI with spectrscopy, arterial-spin label
perfusion, and
dynamic susceptibility perfusion analysis has been recommended,
to better
characterize both the primary process and the findings in the
ipsilateral
basal ganglia.

MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 430**]([**10-19**]):
Redemonstration of extensive bifrontal edema infiltrating the
corpus callosum, with small areas of posterior enhancement.
Overall, the
appearance favors glioblastoma over lymphoma, although
encephalitis can have the same imaging appearance. Correlation
with prior MR examinations is critical to evaluate the evolution
of these findings in the setting of the patient's biopsy and
possible ischemic event. 2. Abnormal pectroscopic evaluation
demonstrating high choline in all three regions selected, which
can be seen in malignant brain tumors but also can be seen with
lymphoma and demyelination, as well as infectious processes. 3.
Normal MR perfusion study with no definite areas of
hyperperfusion to definitely suggest malignancy. 4. Failed
arterial spin labeling.

MR BRAIN [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No specific evidence of intracranial infection; though subtle
findings of infection may be obscured by the global
abnormalities, above. 2. New opacification of the sphenoid
sinuses, and thickening of the right
frontal sinus; though these findings may be ""passiv,"" related to
prolonged
supine positioning and/or intubation, infection cannot be
excluded. 3. Extensive bifrontal edema infiltrating the corpus
callosum with small foci
of marginal enhancement, dorsally, overall stable, with no new
enhancing
focus seen. 4. Further pathologic T1-hyperintensity within the
right basal ganglia, and in cortex overlying the zones of white
matter edema, of uncertain clinical significance. Though this
may relate to a primary infiltrative neoplastic (or
demyelinative) process, secondary ischemic or neurodegenerative
processes remain differential considerations.

CT Torsoe: 1. No obvious neoplastic process identified in the
chest, abdomen or pelvis. 2. Small left upper lobe pulmonary
nodule is unchanged compared to [**2147-10-15**]. In the
absence of malignancy or significant risk factors (ie smoking),
no further follow-up is needed. If this history does exist,
follow- up in one year is recommended.

MR BRAIN [**12-12**]: 1. No significant change in extent of white
matter FLAIR hyperintensity and right basal ganglia T1
hyperintensity from recent MRI from [**11-15**]. Improvement
compared to [**2147-10-2**]. 2. Sphenoid sinusitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after immediate transfer from
[**Location (un) 6692**] airport for respiratory distress.  His presentation is
quite complicated.  Per OSH records, and discussions with
ex-wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was apparently visiting with his
family in [**Location (un) 5770**], LA, when he developed left sided weakness
and sensory deficits.  He was hospitalized at [**Hospital 80057**]
Medical Center in Merron, LA. During this hospitalization, he
was discovered to have significant bilateral frontal brain mass.
He subsequently underwent right sided biopsy to identify
pathology. Per OSH pathology identified Grade II astrocytoma. He
was apparently hospitalized for 4 weeks, but then needed to be
med-evac from LA because of the hurricane warnings.  He was then
transferred to a rehab facility in [**Location (un) 80058**], [**State 26110**](St.
[**Hospital 6783**] Medical Center). Apparently because the patient's
ex-wife resided in MA, she requested he be transferred to MA, as
he had no friends/family in [**State 26110**]. During his medical flight
to MA, he experienced SOB and desaturations and upon landing was
taken to an OSH ED where he was intubated and later transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] after a subsegmental PE was identified.

He was initially managed in the ICU for two days secondary to
his respiratory status issues, but after several subsequent
stable blood gasses and no further issues with respiration; he
was weaned to extubation.  After he was extubated, he was
transferred to floor status on [**10-18**].  Neuro-oncology and
radiation oncology consults were obtained, and secondary to the
inadequacy of documentation provided, it was recommended to
pursue an additional biopsy.  However, due to lack of legal
documentation to identify the ex-wife as the health care proxy,
guardianship and guidance was initiated with the legal
department. In the interim however, various specialized MRI and
PET scans were ordered to further interrogate the pathology of
his intracranial mass. Results are listed previously in this
document. His initial pathology was reviewed by another outside
pathologist and the slides were sent here for review and the
final descision, as above, is a demyelinating process and not
oncologic.  With this new information he was transfered to the
neurology service for further evaluation and treatment.  He had
an LP which was unremarkable and negative for oligoclonal bands.
 He had an extensive evaluation for causes.  Sginificant but
unrelated findings incluided evidenve of prior Hep B infection
and low TSH and eleveated TPO antibody.  These findings were
discusse with GI and endocrien respectively and recommmended
following labs periodically.

For his demyelinating lesion he completed 5 days of 1gm/day IV
solumedrol and 5 days of IVIG without any response.  He had
another MRI without significant change and then underwent
Cytoxan induction.  Heme/Onc was consulted to help manage this.
During induction he was aggresively hydrated, treated with mesna
and had daily UA's.  He had minimal amount of RBC's in urine
which cleared with hydration and resolved after finishing the
course of cytoxan.  He will follow-up with neurology clinic
where they will discuss continuing cytoxan at that time.  He
should have a follow-up CBC w/Dif in 1 week.

His discarge neuro exam is significant for abulia, but oriented
x3.  He has significant left facial weakness, with intact
extra-ocular movemnts.  PERRL and tongue midline.  Strength exam
is difficult due to motor impersistance but on the right side he
can move agaist resistance.  Left UE is flaccid paresis and LE
is antigravity.  He has brisk reflexes on the left side.
Sensation is intact throughout but he does extinguish with
bilateral stimulation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
62-year-old male with past medical history of multiple
sclerosis, subdural hematoma s/p craniotomy, COPD, multiple
admissions for pneumonia including recent admission for
respiratory distress and clostridium difficile infection who
presents with respiratory distress.
.
The patient was recently admitted on [**2141-12-31**] for aspiration
pneumonia. At that time he was treated with vancomycin,
levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a short coarse
which was narrowed to levofloxacin. He was also diagnosed with
C. Diff and started on metronidazole at that time.
.
The patient was discharged to rehab where he was at his baseline
state of health (AOx0, minimally interactive) until the day of
presentation when he was noted to be more lethargic and
increased work of breath with copious secretions. A WBC was
checked and returned elevated to ~25. Given concern for
pneumonia ambulance was called and he was transported to [**Hospital1 18**]
EW for further evaluation.
.
Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic, labored breathing and
saturating mid 80s on room air. He was placed on supplemental
oxygen and transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Initial vitals at [**Hospital1 18**] were: T 98.7, HR 86, BP 99/56, RR 30,
SaO2 91% 4L. He had repeat labs which showed WBC 21 (uptrending
since last admissions), [**Last Name (un) **]. A CXR showed which showed LLL
infiltrates.  He was started on levofloxacin, metronidazole,
vancomycin, methylprednisolone, albulterol and ipratropium. He
had significant work of breathing and was near intubation,
however, ultimately improved. ABG was 7.49/38/87. Vitals on
transfer were: HR 84, BP 114/63, RR 21, SaO2 99%.
.
Currently, appears uncomortable and in respiratory distress.
Loud upper airway sounds.

Brief Hospital Course:
62-year-old male with past medical history of COPD, aspiration
pneumonia, clostridium difficile who presents with respiratory
distress and leukocytosis.
.
# Respiratory distress: Likely secondary to aspiration
pneumonia. Increasing LLL infiltrate. ABG relatively good,
however, copious secretions with poor management. Will need
intubation for excessive secretions. The patient was given vanc,
levo and metronidazole in EW. HCAP would broaden coverage with
piperacillin/tazobactam. Other etiologies considered were
pneumonitis, PE, pulm edema. Most consistent with pneumonia at
this time. Pt was initially on vanc, levo, zosyn.  THis was
narrowed to Zosyn only only sputum cx revealed GNRs, then E coli
and Proteus.  Blood cx remained neg.  CXR showed improvement.
Clinically also, pt improved with less O2 requirement (was
briefly intubated) to now satting well on RA.  Pt does require
frequent sucitoning to manage pulmonary secretions.  Pt
completed a full course of Zosyn and thus is off all IV abx now.

.
# Goals of care:  Pt's nonrelative guardian wishes to change
pt's code status to DNR/DNI.  [**Hospital1 18**] legal department has all the
necessary paperwork to assist in this process.  The process is
pending at time of discharge.
.
# C. Difficile: Appears to have worsening leukocytosis since
last admission. Unclear based on transfer records whether stool
output has improved. Based on worsening leukocytosis would favor
PO vancomycin for now for possible refractory C. Difficile.
Pt was maintained on PO vancomycin during this hospital course
and will need to complete 5 more days after being off all other
abx, starting on [**2143-1-22**].  Pt can be started on probiotics when
able to tolerate.  Bowel regimen shoudl be used with caution.
.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to pneumonia.  C. Difficile may
be contributing. Leukocytosis resolved with treatment with IV
antibiotics and pt has remained afebrile.
.
# COPD: The patient has no evidence wheezes or imaging
suggestive of obstructive process. Not retaining CO2. Did not
receive steroids. Maintained pt on Alb and Ipratropium nebs for
goal sats in 90-93%.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely prerenal in setting of infection.  Recent baseline
is 1.2 although has been higher in past. Cr was 1.5 on admission
but trended down to 1.0 with hydration and TFs.  Pt's tube feeds
were held on day of transfer and pt's urine output decreased to
10-30cc/hr (likely [**1-16**] dehydration), which should be monitored
once tube feeds are resumed.
.
# Anemia: At baseline, required no transfusions.  Remained
hemodynamically stable. Consider work up or deferral to
outpatient.
.
# Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive. Remained stable.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: Appears to be at baseline.  Was continued
on home meds.
.
# Altered Mental Status: AOx0 at baseline. Appears to understand
and responds with one word answers sometimes.
.
# Pt was initially NPO then started on tube feeds.  Pt had a
PICC for IV abx which was removed upon completion of course. Pt
was on Heparin SC for DVT ppx. Pt is full code currently however
pt's guardian is going to court to change it to DNR/DNI.

.
Head CT [**5-29**]: Left subdural hematoma involving the entire left
convexity and left middle cranial fossa, with subfalcine
herniation to the right of [**2-2**] mm. Apparent effacement of the
left suprasellar cistern may be due to oblique patient
positioning but is concerning for early uncal herniation.
.
B/L LENIs [**5-29**]: neg
PCXR [**5-29**]: Clear lungs. No rib fractures.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Occasional PACs.
CT C-spine [**5-30**]: Severe degenerative changes of the cervical
spine. Loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Anterolisthesis of
C4 on C5 is likely secondary to degenerative changes
.
EEG [**6-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of

bursts of sharp slowing and delta frequency slowing over the
entire left
hemisphere and increased voltage gradient over the left
hemisphere
throughout the recording. Additionally, the background over the
right
hemisphere is mildly slow and disorganized. The first
abnormality
suggests subcortical and possible cortical dysfunction diffusely

affecting the left hemisphere, predominantly over the left
fronto-central region. The second abnormality suggests a
widespread
mild encephalopathy with subcortical and cortical dysfunction.
There
were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded.
.
MRI [**6-2**]: No acute infarcts. Stable small left subdural hematoma
and pneumocephalus after recent subdural hematoma evacuation.
Small vessel ischemic changes.
.
Carotids [**6-2**]: No evidence of hemodynamically significant
stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally. Nonvisualization
of the left vertebral artery.
.
KUB [**6-4**]: 1. Marked dilatation of large bowel with the cecum
measuring 12 cm. This may represent colonic ileus, although, a
low rectal obstruction cannot be excluded. Continued interval
followup is recommended.
.
ECHO [**6-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA [**6-5**]: 1. Multiple small subsegmental pulmonary emboli within
the right upper and right lower lobes.
2. Right lower lobe pulmonary nodules are unchanged from the
PET/CT of [**2109-9-18**].
.
Head CT [**6-6**]: No change since the prior examination in the size
of the small left subdural collection, status post evacuation of
a subdural hematoma. No midline shift. No new hemorrhage.
.
KUB [**6-6**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with nondilated loops of
air-filled small and large bowel.
.
Head CT [**6-9**]: Stable appearance of a small left subdural
collection status post evacuation of a subdural hematoma. No
midline shift or evidence of new hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the NeuroICU for Q1 Neurochecks, he
was prepared for surgery on HD#2. Due to his significant
pronator drift and cofounding MS which could impaired his exam
he was consented for a left sided craniotomy for subdural
evacuation. Post operatively he was awake, alert and orientated
X3 with right sided weakness, his dressing was dry and intact. A
head CT postoperatively showed subdural removed with air in the
space. On POD#1 he was found to have right sided weakness and a
repeat head CT showed some reaccumulation of blood in the
subdural space he was transferred to the neurological floor.
.
On POD#2 he was found to have garbled speech and significant
right sided hemi-paresis, he was brought for an emergent head CT
which showed stable amount of blood. He was transferred to the
Neurostep down unit for closer neurological exam. An MRI done
was of poor quality but did not show stroke. An EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm. A chest Xray was done and showed right
infrahilar mass that on a followup CT was shown to be
insignificant stable findings from previous studies. An EEG was
done and showed no epileptiform focus. His vital signs remained
stable. On POD#3 the neuro exam improved in the morning to
a&ox3, but again fluctuated to disoriented and aphasic aphasic
during the day. His temperature spiked to 101.7 and he had a
fever workup that was negative for a source of infection. He
also had two brief episodes of bradycardia and the medicine
service was consulted. He had caroted duplex studies that showed
no significant stenosis.  An echo showed no cardiac
abnormalities. A chest CT report came back that suggested a
possibility of PE, although motion artifact limited the study.
On POD#4 his neuro exam again improved and stayed stable during
the day. He was found to have abdominal distension and had a
fleets enema which resulted in minimal stool.  He was transfered
to the regular floor.
.
On POD#5 His neuro exam and vitals remained stable. KUB was
ordered to assess bowel obstruction which showed a 12cm dilated
cecum and dilated loops of large bowel. General surgery was
consulted. A rectal tube was placed resulting in a large bowel
movement and a decrease in his abdominal distention. On POD#6 A
CTA was ordered and he was premedicated with mucomist for renal
protection. CTA showed multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
Patient was started on IV heparin with adjusted therepeutic goal
PTT 40-60. His neuro exam and vitals remained stable. POD#7 head
CT unchanged from prior. POD#8 repeat KUB improved and rectal
tube was removed. Advanced diet as tolerated. Started coumadin.
POD#9 continued coumadin, INR was still subtherapeutic.  Patient
had one large bowel movement, abdomen no longer distended.
POD#10 am INR still subtherapeutic, but early afternoon it was
at 3.5.  Coumadin dose held. Patient with intermittent
expressive aphasia which resolved spontaneously. Repeat head CT
was unchaged. POD#11 am INR 3.1, patient discharged to rehab.
Plan to continued to hold warfarin and follow INR downtrend.
Likely resume on pm [**6-11**] with goal INR 2.0 (lower end of
therapuetic range). Patient continues to have intermittent
expressive aphasia. Would benefit from speech therapy as well as
aggressive physical/occupational therapy.

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55 year old
male with multiple medical problems notable for multiple
sclerosis that has left him nonverbal with esophageal
dysmotility, muscle spasticity requiring assistance with all
ADLs, who was in his usual state of health until two days
prior to admission when he developed watery, large volume
output from his ostomy.  Today he was noted by staff to have
vital signs of heart rate 120, blood pressure 90/50,
temperature 103.4 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation.  Upon arrival to the emergency department initial
vital signs were temperature of 104.1, heart rate 141, blood
pressure 95/66.  Initial labs recalled for increased white
blood cells with left shift, increased BUN and creatinine
with pre-renal azotemia.  Chest x-ray without obvious
infiltrate.  UA within normal limits.  EKG unchanged.  LFTs
also unremarkable.  Exam remarkable for lack of findings that
would localize infection other than watery ostomy output.
Emergency department course included 5 liters of normal
saline.  A central line was placed in the right groin and
dopamine was initiated for continuing hypotension.
Vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole were started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Multiple sclerosis.  Neurogenic
bladder.  Swallowing disorder.  Schizoaffective disorder.
Depression.  Hypothyroidism.  Status post colectomy with
mucous fistula in [**2106**] secondary to C.diff colitis, course
complicated by abscess.  History of aspiration pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ultracal tube feeds, free water
boluses 250 cc q.six hours, vitamin C, Pepcid 20 mg per day,
Ativan 0.5 mg b.i.d., multivitamin 5 ml per day, desipramine
75 mg q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident.  No
ETOH, no tobacco, no IV drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU vital signs
were temperature 104.1, heart rate 108, blood pressure 94/52,
sating 99% in room air, respiratory rate 18.  HEENT
normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERRLA.  EOMI.  Anicteric.  Dry
mucous membranes.  Poor dentition.  Neck supple with no
lymphadenopathy, JVP flat..  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate, normal S1, S2, 2/6
systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen soft, nondistended,
nontender, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremity exam no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ DP and PT pulses.
Neurological exam patient alert.  Skin exam mild diaphoresis.
Sacrum was without decubitus ulcer.  Lines ostomy, G-tube and
NG tube sites were clean, dry and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission BUN 40, creatinine 1.3.
Hematocrit 49.7, white count 10.3 with 68 polys, 22 bands, 3
lymphs.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 55 year old male with multiple medical
problems including multiple sclerosis with two days of
diarrhea and now with hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a hospital course notable
for improvement of blood pressure with IV fluid resuscitation
and ability to wean quickly off dopamine for blood pressure
support.  His ostomy output slowed down considerably, back to
baseline by the third hospital day.  He was transferred from
the MICU to the medical [**Hospital1 **] due to his stable blood pressure
on the third hospital day.  His post MICU course was notable
for electrolyte derangements including hypophosphatemia of
less than 1, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia thought to be due
to the combination of diarrhea with normal saline
resuscitation.  He was aggressively repleted with sodium
phosphate, IV magnesium and potassium and his electrolytes
returned toward normal limits by the day of discharge.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Center on
the fifth hospital day in improved and stable condition.

DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital1 5595**] in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As on admission with the following
additions.  Levofloxacin 500 mg per NG q.day times two more
days to complete a seven day course, metronidazole 500 mg
q.eight hours times two days to complete a seven day course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastroenteritis, viral versus bacterial.
2.  Multiple sclerosis.
3.  Status post colostomy.

History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman with hx of lupus nephritis, multiple
sclerosis, hypertension who is presenting with altered mental
status, fever, and shock.  The patient was in her usual state of
health until yesterday when she noticed a rash late in the
evening which she mentioned to her family.  Per family, at that
time she had no other symptom that she mentioned including
headache or vomiting.  Early on the day of admission, the
patient was found minimally responsive and moaning on her bed.
EMS was called.
.

at which time her blood pressure was 150/90 with HR 68. At the
time she had 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  Her lisinopril
was increased from 5mg to 10 mg daily and her lasix was
increased from 20 mg to 40 mg daily.
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were 104  140  60/palp 16
86% on 100%.  She received 6L of NS. She was intubated for
airway protection. A RIJ central line was placed after a failed

Pertinent Results:
[**2117-7-4**] CXR -
1. ET tube approximately 1 cm above the carina. NG tube in
appropriate position and IJ catheter within the cavoatrial
junction.
2. Left suprahilar increased rounded density and left mid lung
zone 1.7 cm nodule. Dedicated lateral view may be of use in
determining what these structures are.
.
[**2117-7-4**] CT torso -
1. Moderate pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, ascites,
subcutaneous edema, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema are
all consistent with volume overload.
2. Small anterior left pneumothorax.
3. Consolidation in the lower lobes of the lungs bilaterally,
most suggestive of aspiration, probably with a component of
atelectasis as well. Infection cannot be excluded.
4. Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2117-7-4**] CT head - Limited study without evidence of hemorrhage or
mass effect.
.
[**2117-7-6**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Worsening of bibasilar effusions and associated airspace
disease, most
likely atelectasis, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Slight decrease in pericardial effusion.
2. Persistent, diffuse simple ascites, with new
ascending/transverse colitis without dilatation or perforation.
No definable abscess or focal collection, as clinically
questioned. Findings are suspicious for infectious colitis;
however, this could also be seen with ischemic bowel as a result
of prior hypoperfusion episode and/or ongoing vasculitis, given
the history of SLE. Diffuse mild small bowel thickening is felt
to be due to third spacing.
3. Delayed enhancement and no evident excretion of contrast
through the
kidneys at this time, compatible with ATN.
4. Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2117-7-6**] CT Right lower extremity:
1. Surgical wound as described above in the mid thigh anteriorly
with packing material. No soft tissue or muscle fluid collection
or abscess.
2. Diffuse low-attenuation throughout the muscles of the thigh,
which may represent muscle edema. Muscle infarct is not entirely
excluded.
3. Fluid tracking in both the deep and superficial fascial
compartments of the anterior and posterior thigh. No soft tissue
gas is present.
4. Probable bone infarct of the proximal tibia.
.
[**2117-7-4**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20
%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion, mostly posterior (minimal
anterior fluid seen). There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomyopathy. Moderate pericardial effusion
without overt tamponade.
.
[**2117-7-14**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with history of multiple sclerosis, SLE c/b
nephritis presenting with altered mental status found to be in
shock complicated by multi-organ failure.
.
# Septic shock: [**2-27**] serratia bacteremia presumably from GI
source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.  Shock requiring
max dose 4 pressors on presentation and she was initially
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids
until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia.  Also cardiogenic
in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial
echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p
treatment of sepsis).  Serratia was initially covered with
cefepime which was then changed to ciprofloxacin given
sensitivities as per ID recs.  She completed a full 2 week
course of the above antibiotics with resolution of her shock and
discontinuation of pressor support.  Of note, she also grew
serratia from right leg deep tissue biopsy (performed by surgery
on presentation), but suspect leg was seeded from blood as
opposed to leg as source of bacteremia.  CT right LE was
negative for fluid collection/abscess/air. At the time of
discharge, her BP was stable, she was afebrile, and there was no
leukocytosis.
.
# Livedo necrosis:  Right lower extremity biopsied on initial
presentation out of concern for necrotizing fasciitis and source
of sepsis.  General surgery and dermatology were consulted and
deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did
also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood.  CT right
lower extremity was unrevealing for abscess and air was leg was
presumably seeded from bacteremia as opposed to leg as source.
Aggressive wound care was performed daily. She will need follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (surgery) as outpt. for wounds (ph#
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2723**]). Will need wound care per wound care
recommendations.
.
# Fungemia:  [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans grew from [**7-19**] blood cultures
presumably from line source as initial cultures were drawn from
tunnelled line.  She was started on caspofungin pending [**Female First Name (un) **]
sensitivities and tunnelled, PICC and A-line were all
discontinued.  Surveillance cultures were monitored without
subsequent growth after initial positive.  Caspofungin was then
changed to fluconazole as it was sensitive and she completed a 2
week course from date of first negative blood culture.
.
# RIJ/Rt brachial DVT:  Developed in the setting of right sided
tunnelled line.  She was started on heparin gtt and tunnelled
line was discontinued.  She was started on coumadin, and the
heparin gtt until INR [**2-28**].  goal PTT should be between 50-70.
.
# Anemia/hct drop:  Has baseline anemia from underlying renal dz
and renal failure however now with acute drop while on heparin
gtt.  She did have bloody oral secretions but not enough to lose
that amount of blood (23.5-->19).  She has had no gross blood
per GI tract however concerning is the increase in her BUN.  No
other clear source of blood loss.  Prior to discharge, she had
some frank blood from her tracheostomy, and heparin gtt was
stopped.  Her HCT remained stable.  Repeat bronchoscopy did not
show any areas of frank bleeding, and it was thought to be
secondary to trauma from the tube. Heparin was stopped for 2
days, and then restarted without incident.  Her HCT remained
stable.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated on presentation in
the setting of altered mental status.  She was extubated,
however failed x1 and was reintubated due to profound
respiratory muscle weakness, copious oral secretions and
inability to clear them.  She was again extubated however had
probable aspiration event with acute hypoxia and brdaycardia
again requiring reintubation.  given her prolonged intubation,
she was trached and a PEG was placed by interventional
pulmonology.  She tolerated this well, and at the time of
discharge, she was on a tracheosty mask at 35% FiO2. The
tracheostomy tube was replaced with a shorter tube on the day of
discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure/Lupus nephritis: patient had rising Cr
thought to be lupus nephritis prior to this admission.  She
became oliguric on admisison requiring initiation of CVVH which
she tolerated well and was transitioned to HD.  In the setting
of fungemia, however, her tunnelled line was discontinued and
her UOP continued to improve.  Her cellcept was held on
presentation and briefly restarted before again being held in
the setting of fungemia.  Stress dose steroids were initiated on
presentation and hydrocortisone was subsequently titrated down
to prednisone 10mg daily and she was discharged on cellcept
500mg qid. She should also receive epogen per her regular
schedule and follow up with her nephrologist.
.
# Oral ulcers:  During her course, she developed severe oral
ulcers involving her lips and within the oropharynx.  HSV1 was
cultured from lip ulcers and she was started on valtrex for a
14-21 day course.  Topical viscous lidocaine was used for pain
control. She is currently on a prophylactic dose of valtrex.
.
# Pancytopenia: Leukopenia on presentation secondary to
sepsis/DIC vs. due to lupus vs. in setting of cellcept.  Her
cellcept was held and her sepsis was treated and her WBC count
and hct improved.  Platelet recovery lagged however improved to
the 100K range where they remained stable.
.
# SLE:  With lupus nephritis as above.  Off cellcept temporarily
given fungemia and on hydrocortisone. She was discharged on
prednisone 10mg qdaily and cellcept [**Pager number **] qid.
.
# MS: Stable without active issues.
.
# nutrition: A PEG tube was placed and she tolerated tube feeds.
She was started on an oral diet after a speech and swallow
evaluation. When she has adequate nutritional intake by mouth
her tubefeeds can be weaned. She had some discomfort surrounding
her PEG tube and was evaluated several times by interventional
pulmonology and no problems were found. This is likely due to
pain at the surgical site.
.
# hypertension: maintained with good blood pressure control on
his current medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo patient with advanced MS presents with multilobar
PNA.
.
1.) Multilobar Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient had a
fever, cough, and chest xray finding s consistent with
pneumonia.  He developed progressive respiratory distress and
was electively intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
He underwent a bronchoscopy which on lavage releaved staph
aureas (methicillin resistant) and a moderate amount of
hemorrhage.  He was treated initially with broad spectrum
antibiotics which were later tailored once antibiotic
sensitivities were available.  He will complete a 14 day course
of vancomycin (7 days of which after discharge).  Of note, he
did develop a self-limited mild eosinophilia while on zosyn.  He
did not develop a rash or clinically worsen.  This should not be
thought of as an absolute contra-indication for future zosyn
therapy should this antibiotic be clinically indicated.  He was
gradually weaned from the venilator as he was diuresed with
furosemide and acetazolamide.  He was successfully extubated and
upon discharge he had stable oxygenation with supplemental
oxygen by face mask.  A PICC line was placed for antibiotics.
His vancomycin on the day of discharge was held for a high
trough level.  His goal vancomycin trough should be [**10-6**].  He
will be discharged on 1 gram of vancomycin every day which can
be adjusted per vancomycin trough.  He received nebulized
bronchodilators.
.
2.) Hypotension: The patient did develop hypotension to sbp ~90
during his admission.  This was thought likely to be from
sepsis.  He was fluid resusitated and received brief period of
vasopressors.  He had an appropriate response on [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim
testing and did not require steroid replacement.  Upon discharge
he was normotensive with maintenance of adequate urine output
and stable creatinine.
.
3.) Anemia. Hct 27 (baseline low 40's). Guiac positive ostomy
output per ED. The hematocrit drop was thought secondary to the
pulmonary hemorrhage with subsequent blood being swallowed into
the stomach.  His hematocrit stabilized.  He did not require
blood transfusions.
.
4.) Hypothyroid: no acute issues during this hospitalization and
he continued on his home dose of synthroid.
.
5.) GERD. PPI, elevate head of bed.
.
6.) Psych. H/o schizoaffective disorder, anxiety.  The patient
is non-verbal and minimally responsive at baseline and it was
difficult to assess mood or thought disorders.  A psychiatry
consult was obtained to make recommendations on use of the
patient's despiramine during this acute illness.  A despramine
level was checked and found to not be toxically elevated.  He
was continued on this medication.  He received versed and
fentanyl while intubated then low dose ativan as needed for
anxiety and agitation post-extubation.
.
7.) Multiple Sclerosis: The patient has advance multiple
sclerosis. He has a neurogenic bladder and chronically foley
dependent.  Urine output was monitored with foley catheter in
place
.
8.)  PPx. PPI, Heparin SC, hold bowel reg/has colostomy
.
9.)  FEN. He recieved tube feeds via his gastrostomy tube.  His
electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
.
10.) Thrombocytosis: The patient had an elevated platelet count
which was thought to be a reactive process secondary to his
resolving pneumonia exacerbated by the diuresis that was
required to resolve the pulmonary edema.  This lab value should
be follow-up to insure resolution.
.
11.) Full Code. Confirmed in NH records and with sister who is
legal guardian.
.
12.) Dispo: The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit
while in the hospital. He was transferred back the the MAC unit
where he was a resident.
.
13.) Access: He had a subclavian central venous catheter placed
for volume resusitation.  He was discharge with PICC line for
the IV antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo patient with advanced MS,schizoafffective d/o and
hypothyroidism, recently discharged after tx for necrotizing
MRSA PNA and sepsis who presents with fevers and tachypnea.
.
* Fevers and leukocytosis: Pt presented with high temps and WBC
of 21 with a left shift.  The day PTA he was afebrile and WBC
was 9.  His hypotension suggested early sepsis. Sources for
fever included c.diff (likely with rapid rise in WBC and recent
abx use), recurrent PNA or aspiration (though pt improving on
vanc until [**10-6**] and CXR improved), line infection or wound
infection from skin breakdown (multiple areas of breakdown).
His urine culture was negative and CXR did not show evidence of
new PNA. Sputum showed growth of MRSA and sparse morganella
morgani.  He did have increased ostomy output, but this is an
ileostomy so it was thought that it was less likely this was [**1-19**]
to c.diff.
-started on vancomycin for coverage of MRSA PNA (course to end
on [**10-16**].
-started on flagyl for possible c. diff on [**10-7**]. His c.diff
toxin was negative x3.  C. diff toxin B is still pending.
Flagyl was dc'd on [**10-12**].
-pt was started on ceftazidime for coverage of GNRs and
pseudomonas.  Course should end on [**10-16**].
Patient had a pneumonia form citobacter and a wound infection
with Klebsiela both sensitive to Meropenen.
Patient at this point had finished the course of ALL antibiotics
Wound should be packek we to dry TID

.
*Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Pt desatted to 85% on RA on the day of
admission. Sats improved to 99% on NRB.   He was able to be
transitioned to a face mask. The source for increasing tachypnea
was unclear. Could have been [**1-19**] to increasing secretions,
worsening PNA, or aspiration.  Did not appear overloaded, so did
not this this was the source.  He was continued on a face mask
and did not desat during the rest of his admission.  His CXR
remained stable and he was continued on neb treatments and chest
PT.  He was continued on vancomycin (end date [**10-16**]) for MRSA
and ceftazidime.  He will need a repeat chest CT in 6 months for
f/u.
Patient after GT surgery remained intubated, failure to
extubate. On [**2119-10-19**] underwent tracheostomy:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open tracheostomy tube placement.

ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman, with a history of multiple sclerosis, who was
recently admitted with complications and required prolonged
intubation. Due to his persistent need for mechanical
ventilation, we have been asked to place a tracheostomy tube
to protect his vocal cords and to allow for effective
ventilatory weaning and pulmonary care. The patient has had a
prior history of tracheostomy tube placement. Therefore, the
following procedure was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the
operating room, and the procedure was performed open due to
the history of a prior tracheostomy tube. The operation was
performed on the patient's ICU bed. The patient was
positioned supine with his neck extended but head not
floating. I examined his neck and found that the old
tracheostomy scar was overlying the cricoid. The cricoid had
a central defect in it and scarring around it, and it
appeared that the prior tracheostomy had been placed at least
partially through the cricoid. I chose to go for a slightly
inferior incision and place the tracheostomy in the proper
position through the second and third tracheal rings.

We thus made a 2 cm transverse incision approximately 0.5 cm
inferior to the old tracheostomy scar and dissected down
through the platysma. We split the strap muscles and
immediately came upon the cervical trachea. We divided the
isthmus and identified the second and third tracheal rings.
We then created a trapdoor incision with a lateral anterior
incision between the first and second tracheal rings and a
vertical anterior incision through the second and third
tracheal rings. We then placed a #8 Portex cuffed
tracheostomy tube without difficulty. We properly secured it
with 3-0 nylon sutures bilaterally and placed trache tape.

We had excellent end-tidal CO2 and good volume exchange. The
patient tolerated the procedure well.


.
*Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive with SBPs in the 90s at
admission. Had some end organ damage in the setting of this as
Cr was elevated to 1.7 and cardiac enzymes were elevated,
thought [**1-19**] to demand ischemia.  Was thought possibly [**1-19**] to
early sepsis, though lactate is 1.4 and SBPs improved with IVFs.
Also could have been due to hypovolemia from possible c.diff or
inadequate intake.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim showed appropriate response at
this admission (23->33->44).  During his admission he again
became transiently hypotensive. Ostomy showed liquid black/dark
green stool that was guiac positive (had been in the past) and
he had a hct drop of 6 pts (29 to 23) on [**10-11**].  It was thought
this was [**1-19**] to GI bleed. He was transfused 4 units of PRBCs and
4 units of FFP (INR 1.6) and given vitamin K prior to transfer
to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for surgery for removal of PEG tube.
.
* ""Lost"" G tube: On [**10-9**], his PEG was noted to be missing. It
is unclear how it disloged, but abdominal CT revealed that it
was in the distal duodenum. He had serial KUBs with no evidence
of obstruction. GI scoped him through the ileostomy but was
unable to retrieve it. Surgery was consulted but since the pt
was hemodynamically stable with no evidence of obstruction it
was initially decided to let it pass. On [**10-11**] hct started
dropping and SBPs were lower. Repeat abd ct showed the G tube
had not moved so it was decided he should proceed to surgery for
removal. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**10-12**].
on  [**2119-10-12**] patient underwent surgery:

.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Retained foreign body in terminal ileum.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Retained foreign body in terminal ileum.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding

NAME OF PROCEDURE:
1. Gastroscopy.
2. Ileoscopy.
3. Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions.
4. Enterotomy with removal of foreign body from terminal ileum.

RESIDENT: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 59 year-old
gentleman with advanced multiple sclerosis and schizo-affective
disorder who is wheelchair-bound and lives in a nursing home. He
was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with a
significant pneumonia when his long-term feeding gastrostomy
tube
was noted to have migrated into his gastrointestinal tract. The
tube was reportedly a Foley catheter and was visible on an
abdominal CT scan having migrated into the terminal ileum. The
patient was followed for several days, as he was not obstructed
and was clinically stable. However, on the day of surgery ,the
patient began to have fairly significant melena via his
ileostomy
with a transfusion requirement of 3 units of packed red blood
cells. It was unclear if this new gastrointestinal bleeding was
related to ischemic necrosis secondary to possible
intussusception related to the feeding tube. Repeat abdominal
CT scan showed no findings concerning for ischemic bowel and
the foreign body was still located within the terminal ileum.
However, given the failure of the feeding tube to migrate on
serial imaging studies and the new onset of gastrointestinal
bleeding, I advised operative exploration with removal of the
feeding tube from the terminal ileum. The risks and benefits
of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient's
sister, who serves as his health care proxy, and permission was
granted.

OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
1. Gastroscopy via his existing the G-tube site showed no
evidence of source of bleeding in the stomach. In addition,
there was bile reflux from the pylorus, suggestive of no
evidence of bleeding source in the duodenum.
2. Ileoscopy was performed via the ileostomy in the right
lower quadrant. There was no evidence of bleeding site in
the distal 10-15 cm of ileum, but we had difficulty
visualizing beyond this secondary to a large amount of
liquid stool. In addition, we could not visualize the
feeding tube.
3. After intra-abdominal exploration, a coiled Foley catheter
was folded upon itself in the distal ileum with the balloon
inflated. There was no evidence of ischemic injury to the
bowel or source of GI hemorrhage at this location.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the
preoperative holding area and taken to the operating room where
he was positioned supine on the operating room table. After the
induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, an arterial line
and right internal jugular central venous line were placed by
the
anesthesia team. Gastroscopy was performed via the gastrostomy
site in the upper abdomen. This showed no evidence of a source
of
hemorrhage in the stomach nor in the duodenum, as there was
reflux of bile from the pylorus into the stomach. The air was
evacuated from the stomach and the same tube was then introduced
through the ileostomy in the right lower quadrant. We were able
to pass the tube approximately 10-15 cm without evidence of
source of GI bleeding nor could we visualize the foreign body.
Visualization, however, was limited by a large amount of green
liquid stool and so this portion of the procedure was
terminated.
The right lower quadrant ileostomy was then oversewn with a 2-0
silk suture. The abdomen was widely sterilely prepped and draped
in usual fashion. Intravenous antibiotics had been administered
in the ICU prior to transfer to the operating room.

A generous midline incision was fashioned and carried down
through the fascia with the cautery. The abdomen was entered
carefully sharply without incident. There was no evidence of
ascites. An extensive lysis of adhesions then ensued using
[**Doctor Last Name **] clamps to elevate the fascia. This lysis of adhesions
was accomplished largely with the Metzenbaum scissors but also
with the cautery and no untoward events occurred. The foreign
body in the form of a coiled Foley catheter tube with an
inflated
balloon was easily identified in the distal ileum. There was no
evidence of intussusception or ischemic insult to the bowel at
this location. There were extensive adhesions of the distal
ileum
down into the pelvis which explains why this foreign body was
unable to pass beyond its current point nor would it likely have
done so. We first elected to deflate the Foley catheter balloon
with a 22 gauge needle and syringe through the wall of bowel.
After this was accomplished, a small enterotomy was made on the
antimesenteric border of the small bowel. Secretions and air
was aspirated with the Yankauer suction device. The catheter
was then grasped with a curved clamp and extracted from the
small bowel without incident. The tube was noted to be
completely
intact. The mucosa of the small bowel appeared normal without
evidence of bleeding. The enterotomy was then closed in 2 layers
with an interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture as a full-thickness for
the
inner layer and then several interrupted 3-0 silk Lembert
sutures
to invert the closure. The abdomen was then irrigated.

We attempted to place a GJ tube via the existing gastrostomy
site in the upper abdomen; however, given dense adhesions in the
upper abdomen, we could not safely pass this catheter via the
duodenum into the jejunum with our hands. Accordingly, we
aborted
this portion of the procedure. The fascial incision was closed
with a running #1 looped PDS suture. Subcutaneous tissues were
irrigated and the skin was closed with staples. A sterile
dressing was applied and the suture over the ileostomy was cut
and an appliance was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure
well without complication. He was transferred back to the
intensive care unit, intubated and in stable condition.

COMPLICATIONS: None.

*ARF:  Pt's Cr was elevated at 1.7 at admission.  Appeared pt
was dry at presentation and this was likely pre-renal in nature.
Cr improved with IVFs and medications were renally dosed.

.
*Elevated troponin: Pt's troponin was elevated to 0.12 today,
with ck of 269.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia with no ST
changes. Per report, pt was seen by cardiology who thought this
was demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension.  Troponins
peaked at 0.15. He was started on aspirin.
.
* Hypernatremia: Pt was hypernatremic at admission.  This was
initially thought [**1-19**] to hypovolemia and sodium did not improve
with IVF hydration.  He was given free water fluid boluses
through the NGT and started on maintence fluid with LR instead
of NS.  He was also started on D5W.  His water defecit will need
to be re-calculated to determine how much D5 he will required.
He was given an additional liter of D5 prior to surgery. Free
water fluid boluses were stopped when concern for GI bleed.
.
* Tachycardia: Likely physiologic, response to infection, fever
and anemia. No ST-T changes on EKG.  Was tachycardic at last
admission.

.
*Elevated LFTs: Slightly elevated at admission,likely [**1-19**] to
hypovolemia. Not active.
.
* Anemia: Hct at admission was stable from last admission. His
baseline prior to that was in the low 40s. He was noted to have
guiac positive ostomy output at the last admission, but hct was
stable. Hct dropped on [**10-11**] and there was concern for GI bleed.
Pls see section on hypotension for further information. Pt was
continued on PPI. Additionally, per blood bank there was concern
for possible delayed transfusion reaction as it was discovered
he was Coombs positive. His hemolysis labs were checked on [**10-10**]
and were normal.

.
*Hypothyroidism: Continued on synthroid.

.
* GERD: PPI, elevated head of bed.
.
* H/o schizoaffective d/o: continued low dose ativan prn
anxiety/agitation and desipramine (TCA)

.
* Neurogenic bladder: U/A was negative. He had a foley in place.
-Continue Foley.
- f/u UCx

abd film:
Two portable abdominal radiographs are significantly limited by
patient motion and underpenetration.  There is a percutaneous
gastrostomy tube which terminates in the mid upper abdomen.  The
second radiograph demonstrates interval injection of contrast
material.  It is not possible on this single projection to
determine where the contrast is located.  No definite evidence
of pneumoperitoneum.  There remains significant scoliosis,
unchanged.  Platelike atelectasis at the right base is again
demonstrated.
.
CXR:
1.  Small right pneumothorax.
2.  New platelike atelectasis at the right lung base.
Persistent left basilar
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with h/o advanced MS, neurogenic bladder,
schizoaffective d/o, hypothyroidism, h/o ex lap for removal of
migrated gastrostomy tube from terminal ileum, h/o tracheostomy
tube placement [**10-22**], p/w fever and tachycardia from rehab
admitted with sepsis.
.
# Sepsis: Pt meets SIRS criteria with multiple potential sources
for fever, including decub ulcer and osteomyelitis (by
definition as can probe to bone), urine positive for ESBL
klebsiella, and possible pneumonia given copious secretions.
Ultimately it was felt his sepsis was primarily secondary to
ESBL urosepsis. He was treated with IVF bolusus and levophed
initially and it was easily weaned. He needs to complete a 14
day course of meropenem through [**2119-12-29**]. His sputum cultures
were contaminated and with multiple epis, he completed a 7 day
course of vancomycin for potential pneumonia given he had a lot
of secretions. Repeat sputum GS was positive for gram positvies
cocci so vancomycin was restarted on [**2119-12-22**] and he should
complete a 7 day course, through [**2119-12-29**].
.
# Resp failure: He has trach tube since [**10-22**], adequate
oxygenation with spontaneous ventilation on high flow O2. Has
had increasing frothy white sputum and he is net 6.5 L positive.
 We diuresed him slightly each day once he was hemodynamically
stable, on discharge he is euvolemic. We started using MIE for
secretions which worked well. THis should be continued. If his
secretions decrease he should get a trial of a Passey Miur
valve. He will need suctioning Q4 hours.
.
# Pneumothorax: He had evidence of small ptx on CXR after line
placement that progressed on subsequent imaging.  Chest tube
placed by thoracics, placed on water seal [**2118-12-19**], pulled [**2118-12-20**],
and ptx continued to improve on CXR with no residual ptx on
discharge.
.
# ARF: cr 1.7 on admission likely [**1-19**] to hypoperfusion in
setting of sepsis and responded very well to IVFs with
creatinine now at baseline.
.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST both improved since admission.  ALT
has normalized completely.  Likely shock liver. In review of
previous labs, has consistently had transaminase abnormalities,
but not to extent as on admission.
.
# Decub ulcer: Given ability to probe to bone, is c/w
osteomyelitis.  Plastics was consulted and recommended accuzyme
and wet to dry dressings [**Hospital1 **].
.
# G-tube: repositioned by general surgery.  No issues currently.
Also has mucous fistula.
.
# Schizoaffective d/o, agitation: He was given ativan rarely to
control agitation
.
# MS: pt with advanced MS, associated neurogenic bladder. Foley
with adequate urine output
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH 2.7.
--Cont. synthroid 100mcg daily.
.
# Finger sticks: stable in 120's. RISS
.
# GERD: He was continued on a PPI
.
# FEN: Tube feed via G tube, replaced this admission, at goal 65
cc/hr
.
# ppx: We kept head of bed> 30 degrees to prevent vent
associated pneumonia, ppi, sc heparin
.
# Access:  L Midline placed [**2119-12-19**].

30s. Patient is a long term [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident, and was
admitted to the MACU for treatment of pneumonia and urosepsis
with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, and IVF. In
the MACU patient's labs revealed ARF with creatinine of 2.7, as
well as an elevated WBC of 51 with 21% bands. However, today, IV
access was unable to be obtained at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, and patient
was brought to the ED, where he received 4L IVF, and had a
femoral line placed due to concern for sepsis. Patient's BP
increaed from 70s-130s systolic, but then dropped to 80s, at
which point levophed gtt was started. He received vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and metronidazole in the ED prior to transfer.
Patient is nonverbal at baseline but denies any pain.

ECG ([**2-9**]): Sinus tachycardia. Early transition. Other than
rate, no diagnostic abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2119-10-7**] no significant change.

SUPINE AP CHEST ([**2-10**]):  A tracheostomy is in place at the
thoracic inlet.  There are low lung volumes.  The upper lungs
are clear.  There is bibasilar volume loss. Heart size is
difficult to assess, although it is likely normal.  The aortic
contour is unchanged from prior studies.  No pneumothorax.  No
definite effusion is seen.  There is marked right convex
scoliosis of the thoracic spine, limiting the evaluation.
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes, without definite evidence of
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104995**] is a 59 yo M w/multiple sclerosis and neurogenic
bladder, with hx MRSA/VRE UTIs who presents with fever,
hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate and a positive UA
c/w sepsis.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Urosepsis: Patient had fever, hypotension, leukocytosis,
elevated lactate c/w sepsis, with potential sources on admission
being urine, sacral decubitus ulcer, and lung, with his trach
and copious secretions.  He received approx 5L IVF within the
first 12h of admission to the ICU (plus IVF given at rehab prior
to transfer).  He also intermittently required pressors for BP
support during the first 36 hours.  These were weaned well
before transfer back to rehab.  GNR rapidly grew from sputum and
blood cultures, speciated as proteus and pseudomonas sensitive
to cepholasporins. Identical species of proteus grew from urine
culture, and therefore uriary source was most likely.
Initially, we broadly covered him with vanco, flagyl, and
meropenem on admission, then switched to meropenem only and then
ceftazidime once sensitivities returned. He should continue
antibiotics to complete a 14 day course (started [**2-9**]).  A
midline was placed for IV access as well as for long term abx
treatment.  His femoral line was pulled once he was deemed
stable.
.
# Respiratory status. Patient with trach tube in place since
[**2119-10-18**] for failure to wean off vent. Patient with
increased secretions from baseline, requiring frequent
suctioning q1 hours.  He was at his home O2 requirement.  We
used aspiration precautions, continued with nebs, and used
scopolamine patch for thick secretions. Due to increased
secretions, tachypnea, and tachycardia plus additional culture
data of gram positives in sputum culture, vancomycin was added
on [**2-16**] to complete a 7 day course for presumed MRSA
tracheobronchitis. A vancomycin trough should be checked on
[**2120-2-18**] with goal 15-20.
.
# Acute renal failure. Likely in the setting of hypovolemia from
sepsis. Improved to baseline s/p fluid resuscitation.
.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Patient has large Stage IV sacral
decubitus ulcer. Given ability to probe to bone, is c/w
osteomyelitis. Patient has been evaluated by plastics on prior
admissions, and felt not to be surgical candidate.  Wound care
was consulted (see d/c plan for instrtuctions).  We also
continued vitamin C 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and zinc sulfate for wound
healing.  We used oxycodone prn for pain per home regimen.
.
# Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Likely from GI losses
given persistent watery stools, fistula with possible
contribution of early renal failure (although this has since
resolved). Continue to follow.
.
# Ostomy. Patient with large amounts of liquid stool out from
ostomy.  He was C Diff neg x3.
.
# PEG care: His PEG tube was secured in place with sutures after
repositioning per our Surgical team. Patient should continue on
tube feedings via PEG tube, currently at goal.
.
# Schizoaffective d/o, agitation, hx depression/anxiety:  We
continued ativan at home doses.  Haldol prn. We monitored for
aggressive behavior and he was stable.
.
# MS: Patient with advanced multiple sclerosis. No acute changes
in management.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continued synthroid.
.
# GERD: Continued PPI.
.
# FEN: Patient with a history of dysphagia, and has PEG tube in
place.
Restarted tube feeds once clinically stable.
.
# PPx: Senna/colace. Heparin SC.
.
# Access:  Midline. Difficult blood draw.
..
#. Code. Full.  This was discussed with family on admission.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 59 yo m w PMH CAD s/p MI in '[**13**] presents to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
ED after 1 hour of substernal chest pain. Pain began in the
setting of practical exam for surgical technician training. The
pain was [**10-15**], radiated to the left arm and jaw, and was
associated with diaphoresis. There was no nausea or vomiting.
EKG showed STE in III>II and aVF, STD in I and aVL. Pt was given
ASA, SLNG x3, heparin, integrillin, and lopressor and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for PCI. Cath showed right-dominant
system with 90% blockage in mid LCx and 40% blockage in mid RCA.
There was chronic TO of LAD. Patient received 3.0x18 mm Cypher
DES in the LCx. Plan was to return to the cath lab for stenting
of RCA lesion. At end of procedure, pt showed cyanosis on R
thigh and foot, with brisk PT pulse by report, assoc with no
pain. After venous sheath removed, improvement in color. When pt
arrived in CCU, cyanosis was not apparent.
Hospital: On admission to CCU, pt continued on
ASA/Plavix/Integrillin/Statin. BB was held until r/o for occult
bleeding. ACE-I was held given recent contrast load and mild
hypovolemia. He had continued diaphoresis, mild chest pain, but

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course by problem:

1. Ischemia:

Pt p/w inferior STEMI with 90% blockage in LCx and 70% in RCA.
Pt had Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] in LCx on [**2-7**], with benign post-cath
course.  CK peaked at 4733, MBI 8.8, trop 14.98 on [**2-7**].  Pt
continued on ASA, high-dose statin, and plavix.  Integrillin was
continued for 18 hours after catheterization.  Metoprolol and
ACE inhibitor were restarted on HD#1.  RLE cyanosis observed
after catheterization was reduced after removal of venous sheath
and did not recur during inpatient course; right sided LENIs
revealed no evidence of DVT and CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis did not show evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.  Pt had
transient chest pain for 1 day following the procedure, but pain
was not associated with ischemic EKG changes.  Chest pain was
not apparent by day #2 post-catheterization.

The patient underwent placement of a 3.0 x 18mm Cypher DES on
[**2-11**], this time targeting the second occlusion in the distal RCA.
 The post-catheterization course was benign, with no evidence of
cyanotic extremities.  The patient transiently complained of
chest pain following the procedure; the CP was not associated
with EKG changes suggestive of ischemia.  The pain subsided by 6
hours post-cath.  He continued on ASA/high-dose
statin/metoprolol/ACE-I/plavix.  The patient was told to
continue the plavix for 3 months post-cath.
.
2. Pump:

Echcardiogram on [**2126-2-8**] was significant for impaired systolic
function, with EF 30-35%.  There were multiple wall motion
abnormalities, including: inferolateral, mid-distal
anterioseptal, and distal anterior akinesis; and inferior
hypokinesis.  These abnormalities were considered to be possibly
related to hibernating or stunned myocardium; follow-up
echocardiogram 3-4 weeks post-discharge will be helpful to
determine the level of recovery of hibernating/stunned
myocardium and the need for AICD placement.  A follow-up
cardiology appointment was scheduled for several weeks after
discharge.  The patient was continued on lisinopril and
metoprolol to improve long-term outcomes related to systolic
dysfunction.
.
3. Rhythm:

During the inpatient course, Mr. [**Known lastname 108450**] had persistent
asymptomatic bradycardia, which was ntreated.  He had numerous 5
beat runs of AIVR, consistent with recovery form STEMI.
.
4. Cyanosis s/p cath

As mentioned above, the RLE cyanosis post-cath#1 was considered
to be due to venous insufficiency.  It did not recur throuhgout
the hospital course or after the second catheterization.  CT
abdomen and pelvis r/o RP bleed, and LENI r/o DVT.  The patient
had brisk DP pulses during the cyanotic episode and throughout
the hospital course.
.
5.  MS: Currently in remission. Not an active issue.
.
6.  Depression/anxiety: On prozac and ritalin. Ritalin was held
during hospital course given risk of beta adrenergic
stimulation.  The patient was advised not to take Ritalin until
consulting his outpatient cardiologist, given this risk.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
woman with a history of longstanding multiple sclerosis
treated with baclofen intrathecal pump that was recently
reinserted on [**11-29**] due to a low signal on the
previous pump.

The patient was in her usual state of health after that
procedure until two days prior to admission when she
developed fevers and chills.  The patient noted a fever at
home of 102.7.  She also had some nausea and decreased p.o.
intake over the previous two days as well.  She did have
lightheadedness.  She denies photophobia and back pain, chest
pain, shortness of breath, and diarrhea.  She did note neck
stiffness, however.  The patient went to the Emergency
Department, where she was febrile to 102, and her blood
pressure was as low as 85/36 and was given a total of 3
liters of normal saline down in the ED with improvement of
her blood pressure.  She was then transferred to the Fenard
ICU for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives in nursing home.  She has a 20
pack year smoking history, quit 20 years ago.  She has
occasional alcohol and no IV drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, her temperature was
97.8, heart rate 26, blood pressure 105/62, respiratory rate
18, and satting at 94% on room air.  In general, she was an
elderly woman in no acute distress.  Head and neck exam was
notable for having extraocular movements intact, dry mucous
membranes.  Her neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Her
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  On cardiac
examination, showed a regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with active bowel sounds.  She had significant
erythema, warmth, and tenderness over her left lower quadrant
over the incision site.  There was no tracking towards the
back.  Her extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination:  She was alert and oriented times
three.  Her upper extremities [**5-13**], bilateral lower
extremities was [**2-13**], this is approximately her baseline.  Her
back had slight tenderness over the L2 area without any
erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  She had a white count of 24.1 with 86%
polys, 2% bands, 4% lymphocytes, her hematocrit was 45.8,
platelets 320.  Her Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Her lactate was
2.9.  Her urinalysis had no leuks, nitrite, or blood.

Abdominal CT scan showed no abscess or obstruction.  Due to
artifact in the abdominal wall, the pump was not easily
evaluated.

She had a chest film that showed no evidence of pneumonia.

Her EKG was unchanged.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cellulitis:  The patient was admitted to the ICU
presumably for sepsis.  She was initially covered with
Vancomycin and ceftriaxone with a steady improvement over the
next several days with erythema and tenderness over the area.
The patient did not have any Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign
and there was no nuchal rigidity despite the neck and head
ache.  There was no photophobia.

Due to her rapid improvement and the fact that there was no
tracking on her abdomen, a LP was not performed.  Blood
cultures were taken and were negative at the time of this
dictation.

With respect to her hypotension, the patient was responsive
to normal saline, and so it was felt to be a combination of
hypovolemia and potentially sepsis.

2. Baclofen pump/chronic pain:  The Pain service was
consulted, who knows her well, and while they initially
considered removing the device, her rapid improvement over
several days allowed the patient to keep her current pump in
place without having to remove it.

After two days, the patient was initially on Vancomycin and
ceftriaxone, which was changed to ceftazidime due to the
presence of intrathecal device.  On transfer to the floor,
the patient was afebrile and her blood pressure improved
steadily back to her preadmission values and her home
medications were restarted.  The patient will continue to
have two weeks more of antibiotics with Vancomycin and
ceftazidime.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To nursing home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Ceftazidime 2 grams q.8h. x2 weeks.
3. Vancomycin 1 gram q.12. for two weeks.
4. Multivitamin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
lady with a past medical history significant for diabetes,
hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, who
presents with pain and induration at Baclofen pump site.  She
was admitted status post pump removal.  The patient's pump
was placed [**2152-12-9**] and shortly after placement the
patient developed fever and erythema.  The patient was on
broad spectrum coverage with Ceftazidime and Vancomycin until
several days before admission.  The patient called her
physician on the day of admission to report on going erythema
and fluctuance.  The patient went to the Emergency Room.  A
decision was made to remove the pump and the patient was
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics as stated above.  The
patient was followed closely by the pain service upon
admission.  An infectious disease consult was also obtained
from the Emergency Room.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital6 **] in stable condition.

2.  Diabetes mellitus noninsulin dependent.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial
infarction and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
in [**2152-3-11**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glucophage 500 b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg q day.
3.  Toprol XL 125 mg q day.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
5.  Levoxyl 88 micrograms q day.
6.  Folate 1 mg q day.
7.  Multivitamin q day.
8.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 47**] at the
[**Hospital6 80938**] Center.  She has been a resident there
for many years.  She has close family and many grandchildren.
She denies tobacco use and reports rare alcohol.  No illicit
drug use.  The patient is wheel chair bound, but has good use
of her upper extremities.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.9.  Blood
pressure 111/30.  Pulse 53.  Respirations 12.  99%
oxygenation on room air.  General, alert and oriented times
three.  Lungs were bilaterally clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen is packed and bandaged, soft, appropriately
tender.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities no
edema or tenderness.  The patient has no motor abilities in
her lower extremities.  She has clonus bilaterally with
decreased reflexes throughout all extremities.  The patient
has normal speech.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.8,
hematocrit 41.9, platelets 282.  Chemistries were normal.
TSH was 2.8, which is in the normal range.  Differential of
white blood cell count neutrophils 77 no bands.  Kidney and
liver function tests were normal.  The patient had wound gram
stain as well as swab during pump removal, which showed 3+
polys and no organisms.  The swab grew staph aures with
sensitivities pending at the time of this dictation.  Wound
culture from [**1-23**] also grew staph aureus.  Blood
cultures from [**1-23**] are no growth to date at the time
of this dictation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pump site infection:  Wound cultures
grew rare staph aureus as well as coagulase negative staph.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin as well as
Ceftazidine for broad coverage.  This regimen will likely be
tailored to simply Vancomycin upon discharge since no gram
negative organisms were grown on culture.  The patient was
afebrile with vital signs stable during admission.
Infectious disease team followed the patient.  A left PICC
line was placed on the day of discharge for antibiotic
infusion at the [**Hospital 228**] nursing home.  The patient's white
blood cell count normalized and she was stable from this
perspective.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient is status post
inferior myocardial infarction with percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty [**2152-3-11**].  She was continued on her
aspirin, Metoprolol and Atorvastatin.  There were no acute
issues during admission.

3.  Hypertension:  The patient continued on Metoprolol with
good blood pressures.

4.  Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on her current
dose of Levothyroxine.  A TSH was checked and was normal.

5.  Incisional pain:  The patient was given Ketoralac as well
as Tylenol for pain control.  This was sufficient.  These
were recommended by the pain service.

6.  Baclofen withdraw:  The patient was started on a po
regimen of Baclofen to prevent withdraw after discontinuation
of the patient's pump.  The patient had intermittent rigidity
and flushing as well as slowed speech, likely due to the
removal of Baclofen pump.  The patient was given prn Ativan 1
mg q 4 hours with good effect as well as a titration upward
of her po Baclofen to 20 mg t.i.d.  The patient will continue
to be followed by the pain service upon discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Baclofen pump infection with staph aureus as well as
coagulase negative staph.
2.  Multiple sclerosis.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and inferior myocardial
infarction.
7.  Incisional pain.
8.  Baclofen withdraw.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Back to [**Hospital6 80938**] Nursing
Home in [**Location (un) 47**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Same as upon admission with
continuation of Vancomycin 1 gram b.i.d. and Ativan 1 mg
IV/PO prn with draw symptoms of rigidity, flushing,
discomfort.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with the Pain Service
as on her discharge paperwork.  She will also follow up with
her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 10755**] within one week of
discharge.  A new Baclofen pump is planned for eight weeks

Chief Complaint:
left knee and leg pain and constipation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

site.

Exploratory laparotomy, oversew of small suture
tear at former anastomosis and application of fibrin glue.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98925**] is a 83 year-old female with history of
polyarthritis and interstitial lung disease, who is admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after undergoing partial small bowel resection for high
grade SBO.  The patient was originally admitted to the medicine
service on [**7-5**] for 2 days of sharp L knee pain and spasms in
her left lower leg.  ESR and CRP were elevated and she was noted
to have a persistent mild leukocytosis (WBC [**11-4**], with left
shift).  No etiology could be determined for her knee pain.
There was no inflammation of the knee, no DVT, xrays were
normal.  With a suspicion that it could involve her known
inflammatory arthritis, her prednisone was increased from 2.5mg
to 10mg daily and then to 40mg solumedrol IV q8.  Her hospital
course has also been complicated by hyponatremia of unclear
etiology ([**Name (NI) **] 127-132).  Based on urine lytes with urine Na < 10,
it was felt that she was volume depleted however Na did not
improve with IVF repletion.  Another etiology that was
entertained was SIADH [**1-24**] nausea/pain or medication related [**1-24**]
lasix.
.
On the morning of [**7-7**], the patient began having trouble with
urinary retention and was noted to have a distended abdomen.
She reported no BM x 5 days.  KUB was performed and her bowel
regimen was increased.  Abdomen became increasingly distended
over the day and she had a repeat KUB consistent with
obstruction.  She went to the OR on the morning of [**7-8**].  She
had a high grade SBO and underwent partial small bowel resection
with 7cm removed.  Her abdomen was left open with the plan for
re-look in the morning.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**7-5**]/9 with leg pains and spasms as well
as constipation and decreased appetite.  On HD3 she started with
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension.  CT scan 7/17/9
demonstrated high-grade bowel obstruction, with a twisting
appearance of the mesentery and two adjacent transition points
in the left lower quadrant, consistent with a closed loop
obstruction, either from internal hernia or adhesions. Patient
was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and was found
to have strangulating small bowel obstruction secondary to
internal hernia and adhesions. Pt underwent a reduction internal
hernia, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection, over sew of
former jejunostomy site and abdomen was left open for a concern
in the anastomosis antimesenteric perfusion. Patient was
returned to the intensive care unit in critical condition and
taken back to the OR on [**7-9**]/9 for a question ischemic bowel
following previous laparotomy. An oversew of small suture
tear at former anastomosis, application of fibrin glue and
closure was performed. Patient returned again to the intensive
care unit for management. She received vanc and cefazolin while
abdomen was open but that was dc'd when she was closed. She was
started on stress dose steroids post-op. Was succesfully
extubated on [**7-10**]. Due to her chronic history of LE edema, on
chronic lasix [**10-11**] [**Name (NI) 6089**], pt seemed edematous after receiving
large amount of IVF.  Started to diurese on her own post-op but
on [**7-11**] U/O ~30cc/hr. She was started on IV lasix on [**7-12**] with
an adequate response. Patient was transfered to the floor on
[**7-13**] and had a relatively slow return in bowel function. NGT was
clamped and d/c'd but needed to be replaced on [**7-13**] due to
nausea and vomiting. Patient started with diarrhea on [**7-15**],
maintaining always adequate hydration and was tested for C. Diff
(first was negative, second and third are pending).  From a
respiratory standpoint, considering interstitial lung disease,
she improved her respiratory function postop and was maintained
in Albuterol and Atrovent and requiring progressively less
oxygen. Patient was screened for rehab and will be discharged
stable, with adequate PO intake.

PICC line projects over the right atrium, the line should be
pulled back by approximately 3 cm.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

The pre-existing parenchymal opacities have slightly decreased
in severity and extent. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 84 y/o female, resident of nursing home,
with post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung
disease, multiple sclerosis (on prednisone), inflammatory
polyarthritis, and frequent bouts of pneumonia, who presented
with one day of cough, fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and
green sputum.
.
# SIRS/early sepsis/pneumonia: given her history of frequent
bouts of pneumonia with current [**Numeric Identifier **] of fever, chills,
cough, green sputum, elevated WBC, and CXR with suspicion of RML
infiltrate, strongly suspected pneumonia. Given her nursing home
residence and two recent admissions for pneumonia, favor
antibiotic coverage for HCAP. She did report pleuritic chest
pain, for which PE was also on the differential, however this is
felt to be much lower on the differential given her overall
clinical picture of pneumonia/SIRS/early sepsis. With regard to
her pneumonia, she has a CURB 65 score of 2, which is associated
with a 13% mortality. Reassuring that her lactate remains within
normal limits and UOP is adequate.  Pt was started on linezolid
(given vanc allergy), aztreonam and levofloxacin for HCAP
coverage (8 days) as well as coverage for RLE cellulitis
(linezolid) that was greatly improved compared to [**Numeric Identifier **]
in the ED.  Urine Legionella came back negative and pt oxygen
requirement improved dramatically overnight in the ICU.  Blood,
urine, sputum cultures were sent and returned negative. BCX
NGTD.  Pt was much improved on day 2 of admission and was felt
stable and ready for call out to the floor. On the medical
floor, pt continued to do well and was weaned to room air by
time of discharge with improvement in cough and SOB. Last CXR
shows improvement in PNA. Pt will continue levofloxacin,
linezolid, and aztreonam for 3 more days. PICC can be removed
after abx course has ended.
.
# ?cellulitis: area of erythema and warmth over her right ankle.
Received a dose of linezolid in the ED for MRSA coverage, given
her vancomycin allergy. [**Month (only) 116**] have been a factor in the above
picture. By time of transfer to the medical floor, pt no longer
displayed signs of cellulitis. Area did not have erythema upon
transfer to medical floor. She can continue linezolid as above
for possible cellulitis.
.
# Restrictive lung disease: multifactorial. A component of this
is related to her post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis following
her episode of severe ARDS. Her lung function is also
compromised by severe kyphosis, osteoporosis, and generalized
weakness.  Pt was continued on her home steroid dose and
monitored for signs of need for increased dose. She was
continued on her home inhalers and should continue her advair
and duonebs upon discharge.
.
# Inflammatory polyarthritis/multiple sclerosis: stable. Pt was
continued on prednisone at home dose.
.
#Multiple sclerosis and weakness. Pt was continued on tizanidine
per outpatient regimen. Physical therapy could be continued for
the patient.
.
#L.cheek lesion-light brown plaque- with central raised
area-light brown with some scaling-outpatient derm appointment
was arranged for the patient for follow up and potential biopsy.
Pt was advised to discuss with her PCP if she would like an
appointment arranged elsewhere.
.
#history of Recurrent C diff and new-onset diarrhea in ED.
C.diff toxin negative this admission.
.
#Elevated blood glucose levels of 400 in the ICU. AIC 6.6% which
classifies her as ""diabetic"". This was thought to be related to
infection and steroid use. Pts blood sugars remained well
controlled this admission. She required 1unit of humalog
overnight. She should have her finger sticks monitored and
follow a diabetic diet as an outpatient. It can be decided in
the outpatient setting if patient requires aspirin, ACEI etc.
.
#code status-after discussion with patient and her HCP, her CODE
status was changed to DNR/DNI in the ICU. PT confirmed that this
still remains her wish prior to discharge and she filled out
DNR/DNI form.

Discharge Instructions:
You were initially admitted to the ICU for pneumonia. You were
given antibiotics and your symptoms improved. You were
transferred to the general medicine floor and continued to
improve. You were no longer requring oxygen by day of discharge.
Serial chest x-rays have shown resolving pneumonia. You had a
PICC line placed so that you may receive antibiotics and this
can be removed when your course is complete.
.
You reported diarrhea, but your test for C.diff was negative.
.
There initially was some concern of a skin infection on your
R.ankle. This had resolved by the time you were transferred to
the regular floor. The antibiotics you are taking for pneumonia
will treat for a possible infection.
.
You also reported a L.cheek skin lesion. You were advised to
follow up with dermatology for further evalution. An appointment
has been made for you below. If you would prefer another
location, please discuss this with your PCP.
.
Your blood sugar was noted to be elevated when you were in the
ICU. You blood sugars were much better controlled on the floor.
This is likely related to steroids and infection. You should
continue to have your blood sugars monitored in the outpatient
setting and follow a diabetic diet. No medication was started at
this time. You can discuss this further with your PCP if needed.
.
You have a very mild anemia. You may follow up with your PCP for
further evaluation. Please be sure you discuss whether you need
to have a colonoscopy.

dropped into the 70s and RIJ was placed.  A fluid bolus was
given and pressures came up; no pressors were started.  Labs
were significant for a wbc of 11, a BUN of 40 and creatinine of
1.2 (baseline of 0.6).  Troponin was elevated though only
non-specific changes on EKG and patient was given ASA 81.
Patient was confirmed DNR/DNI.  Vitals on admission were: HR of
86, BP: 113/39, RR 29, 95% on 4L.

##########################
Patient passed

Studies
CXR [**2147-12-27**]
A new central venous catheter has been placed via right internal
jugular venous approach. The tip terminates in the right atrium.
A
right-sided PICC line has been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal
and hilar
contours appear unchanged. There is a new patchy left basilar
opacity
suggesting pneumonia. Otherwise background opacities show no
definitive
change, although there may be additional developing right
basilar opacity.
Bony deformities are similar. IMPRESSION: New line terminating
in the right atrium. No evidence for pneumothorax, although a
flexed chin does obscure the medial right lung apex. Findings
suggesting pneumonia, particularly in the left lower lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98925**] is an 85-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for
inflammatory polyarthritis on prednisone, HTN, HL, SBOs, recent
c.diff colitis, and recent PNA who resides in a nursing home and
presented with shortness of breath and elevated white count.
.
#. Pneumonia: The patient was noted to be hypoxic into the 70s
at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab in [**Location (un) **]. She was started on PNA
treatment there with doxycycline on [**2147-12-26**].  Labs obtained on
the same day showed a WBC of 15 and a bicarb of 40. ED visit was
suggested but the patient was initially resistant. At the urging
of her family, the patient was brought to the ED on [**2148-12-26**].
In the ED the patient was initially HD stable. Given linezolid
and levofloxacin for presumed HAP. Also given stress dose
steroids. While in the ED the patient's SBP dropped into the 70s
and RIJ was placed. A fluid bolus was given and pressures came
up; no pressors were started. Transferred to the MICU. In the
MICU the patient was placed on linezolid and cefepime initially.
The cefepime was changed to levofloxacin. The patient remained
afebrile and BPs remained stable. She refused a PICC line. Her
respiratory status was tenuous and she was confirmed DNR/DNI.
Intermittently desaturated to the 60-70% range on nasal cannula
but refused face-tent or NRB. Family was consulted who did not
want to force the patient to accept NRB/face-tent against her
wishes. PICC line was also refused. On [**2148-12-28**] the patient
continued to maintain adequate BPs and was transferred to the
medical floor for further management.
.
#. GOALS OF CARE: The patient is DNR/DNI. Her son is her health
care proxy. On admission here the paitent was refusing multiple
interventions including mask ventilation and PICC line
placement. Discussion was initiated with the patient's son and
daughter who confirmed DNR/DNI but were not prepared to accept
comfort focused care. Would like the patient to continue
recieving antibiotic therapy. Palliative care was consulted who
met with the patient and her family. On the floor patient was
made comfortable and passed a few hours after transfer to the
floor.
.
#. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Troponin was elevated to 0.21 on
admission without worrisome EKG changes. CKMB was reassuring.
Likely strain in the setting of acute infection.  Little concern
for plaque rupture given absence of ST changes on EKG, chest
pain, or other classic signs/symptoms of MI. Continued ASA and
statin.
.
#. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient with creatinine of 1.2 up from
a baseline of 0.6.  Likely dehydration or could represent poor
forward flow from CHF exacerbation. Resolved with fluid
administration.
.
#. ILD:  Continued home inhalers and pulmonary toilet
.
#. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Continued statin

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
female with short gut syndrome, status post ileal colectomy
for volvulus in [**2120**] who is chronically TPN dependent and has
TPN-induced liver failure.  The patient was found by her
husband on the couch the morning of admission looking ill.
The patient stated that she was dizzy, unable to ambulate.
She denied fevers and chills but did complain of abdominal
pain as well as nausea and vomiting on the day of admission.
The patient was also confused and lethargic with much change
from her baseline.  EMS was called.  The patient was found to
have a blood pressure of 70/palpable, heart rate 86.

The patient was taken to an outside hospital ER where she was
placed on oxygen, given ceftriaxone, hydrocortisone, and 2
liters of intravenous fluids.  She received an abdominal CT
that was unremarkable and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis which has presented with recurrent
optic neuritis.
2.  Ileal colectomy done in [**2120**] secondary to volvulus.
3.  TPN dependent.
4.  Degenerative joint disease.
5.  Osteoporosis.
6.  Multiple DVTs.
7.  Progressive liver failure.  At the time of admission, the
patient was waiting to receive liver and small bowel
transplant.
8.  Anemia with a normal bone marrow biopsy.
9.  Status post appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and
tonsillectomy.
10. Multiple line infections and episodes of sepsis.

ALLERGIC:  The patient is allergic to paper tape, Betadine,
and also reports penicillin causes her GI upset.  She has an
allergy to IV contrast, allergy to Demerol, Streptokinase,
and Flagyl which causes nausea.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Calderol 20 micrograms q.d.
2.  Celexa 40 mg q.d.
3.  Codeine 60 mg five times a day.
4.  Lactase.
5.  Levofloxacin 250 mg q.d. of unclear duration.
6.  Prednisone 10 mg q.d.
7.  Prilosec 40 mg q.i.d.
8.  Propanolol 120 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Ritalin 10 mg q.d.
10. Serax 10 mg up to five times a day p.r.n.
11. TPN.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Ceftriaxone.
2.  Dopamine.
3.  Hydrocortisone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the MICU, the patient
had a blood pressure of 95/40 on 15 micrograms of dopamine, a
pulse in the 90s, saturating 100% on 50% face mask,
temperature 99.5.  The patient's skin was remarkable for a
very striking yellow-green color.  HEENT:  Remarkable for a
supple neck, marked conjunctival and scleral icterus and
blindness.  The lungs had scattered bibasilar crackles but no
dullness to percussion.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2, no
murmurs.  She did have a left ventricular lift.  Abdomen:
Minimal bowel sounds, firm, moderate to severe tenderness to
palpation everywhere but worse in the lower quadrants.  Given
the patient's guarding, it was difficult to assess for
hepatosplenomegaly.  The patient had multiple healed surgical
scars.  The patient had a Porta-Cath in her chest that was
nontender with no expressible pus.  The extremities were
remarkable for bilateral pitting edema in her lower
extremities.  The patient's mental status was noted to be
oriented times three but slow with responses.  The patient's
rectal examination was heme-negative.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 136, potassium 2.9,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8.  She had
a white count of 32.6 with a differential of 76 neutrophils,
9 bands, 10 lymphocytes, hematocrit 35.5, and platelets
185,000.  Her AST was 832, ALT 1,178, alkaline phosphatase
28, amylase 194, lipase 1,295.  Her ammonia level was 51,
albumin 1.6.  Her total bilirubin was 21.9.  INR 1.16.  Her
U/A was unremarkable.  The patient's blood gas revealed a pH
of 7.41, PC02 37, P02 87 on 50% face mask with a lactate of
2.1 and an ionized calcium of 0.97.

The patient's CT, as read here, was notable for no ductal
dilatation, no evidence of perforation, only for ascites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was aggressively fluid
resuscitated on arrival and weaned from the dopamine drip
overnight.  The patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics including Zosyn and vancomycin.  The patient was
evaluated by Surgery who declined intervention at this time
and preferred medical management.

The patient was pan cultured.  None of her cultures while she
was in the Intensive Care Unit the first time were positive.
The patient was ultimately felt to have pancreatitis, the
etiology of which was unclear.  The patient's pain initially
resolved and the patient was much improved with stable blood
pressures and tolerating p.o.  She was transferred out to the
regular medical floor on [**2142-11-12**].

The patient had difficulty with potassium homeostasis on the
floor and a rising white blood cell count; however, minimal
abdominal pain and only low-grade temperatures.  Given the
increasing white blood cell count, the patient underwent
repeat abdominal CT which showed a large pancreatic
pseudocyst.  At this time, the patient was restarted on
Zosyn.

The patient remained afebrile but did have blood cultures
drawn from her Porta-Cath turn positive for
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 48 hours after they were
drawn.  Given the positive blood culture and the rising white
blood cell count, the attending wished to have the patient's
pseudocyst drained which was done in Interventional Radiology
on [**2142-11-18**].  Gram stain from the drainage of the
pseudocyst was negative for organisms.

After return from the procedure, the patient markedly became
hypotensive to the 80s and had confusion.  She was bolused
with 2 liters normal saline and had some improvement;
however, the patient was febrile to 100.3 and given her
hypotension and febrile state, she was transferred back to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was covered
with Zosyn, gentamicin, and vancomycin.  The question of
removing the patient's Porta-Cath was discussed with Surgery
and it was felt that the patient had not had any positive
blood cultures since the initiation of vancomycin; therefore,
Staphylococcus epidermidis was unlikely to account for this
patient's hypotensive state.  The patient was started on
stress-dose steroids and remained initially stable.

Unfortunately, the patient's white count continued to rise
and her hematocrit began to drop initially from 27.1 down to
24.1.  The patient was Guaiac negative from below.  It was
unclear what the source of her bleeding was.  The patient's
hematocrit dropped as low as 20 and she was given multiple
units of packed red blood cells.

The patient had a diagnostic paracentesis due to concern of
bleeding into her peritoneum secondary to the pseudocyst
drainage; however, this revealed no white blood cells,
minimal red blood cells, and no organisms.  The patient's
white count continued to climb and her belly became more
distended and tender.  Unfortunately, the patient also
developed increasing coagulopathy and her BUN and creatinine
began to rise.  The patient began to experience more
respiratory distress.

Given the increase in belly pain, Surgery was consulted and
declined to do any intervention given the high mortality
associated with taking this patient to the OR.  The patient
was managed with antibiotics and packed red blood cells as
possible.  However, it was decided after discussion with the
patient's family and the attending that this patient would be
DNR/DNI with no CPR indicated.

The patient continued to deteriorate and complained of
extreme pain.  Her breathing became very labored.  The
patient began to ask for more morphine.  We agreed to give
the patient more morphine and explained that doing so may
actually decrease her drive to breathe and ultimately hasten
her death.  The patient understood this and wanted to be
pain-free.  We spoke to her husband about this as well and he
agreed with making her comfortable and continuing the
morphine.

The patient was at that time started on a morphine drip,
titrated to comfort.  The patient passed away early in the
morning on [**2142-11-23**] and was pronounced at 1:30 a.m.
on [**2142-11-23**].

episode of urosepsis admitted from PCP's office with generalized
weakness and tachycardia. Weakness began approximately 2-3 days
ago, came on suddenly. Patient was initially able to perform
daily activities at baseline. This morning noted by caregiver
and PCA to have increased lethargy, particularly with
transferring in and out of shower. Patient has no localizing
complaints other than mild sinus congestion x2-3 weeks without
rhinorrhea, sinus tenderness, or sore throat. He reports sick
contact with neighbor who has a ""cold or the flu."" At PCP's
office today, he was noted to be tachycardic to low 100s with
baseline systolic blood pressure - given severe weakness and
similarity in presentation to recent episodes of urosepsis, he
was asked to come in to the ED. Of note, patient did have
influenza vaccination this year. He is unsure when he had the

Brief Hospital Course:
53M with progressive multiple sclerosis with weakness x2-3 days
in context of fever, tachycardia

septicemia, NOS:  Patient met SIRA criteria on RR, fever,
tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Lactate within normal range. Many
conditions meet SIRS criteria, including infection, vasculitis,
autoimmune disease, thyrotoxicosis, pancreatitis, vasculitis. No
evidence of pulmonary, GI, neurologic, urinary, or derm
infection. Potential infectious sources include sinusitis (mild
symptoms x2-3 weeks) or influenza (neighbor with potential
influenza, although patient without cough, myalgias). Pt
required IVF for hypotension and was on phenylephrine drip with
improvement in BP. At time of transfer, he had been off pressors
for >24h with stable SBP in high 90s-110s. He was started on
vanc/zosyn pending culture results. CT sinus was negative for
infection. Leukocytosis persists (17.3 at transfer) but is
trending downwards. Repeat infectious w/up negative for active
infection. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**7-15**] and Zosyn on
[**7-16**]. PAtient remained afebrile, asymptomatic, and without
change in white count. Infectious w/up, including viral stool
culture was negative for source.

hypovolemia: Resolved with 8L fluid in first 24h. On discharge
from ICU, total body volume up with trace to 1+ edema in all
extremities, but experiencing autodiuresis. Leaving foley while
urine o/p high, dc when able.

Anemia: Hct stable. Likely dilutional as he has received almost
8 liters of fluid.  No e/o active bleeding.  Trending HCT daily.

Multiple sclerosis: Stable. Pt becomes contracted when ill. He
became less contracted as he improved. Not currently on any
medications. Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10835**], neurology.

Brief Hospital Course:
# hypoxia/respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia with sepsis
- Pt with severe COPD on 2L O2 at baseline at home, now with new
O2 requirement necessitating BIPAP for 30 minutes in the ED.
Remained hemodynamically stable. H/o recurrent aspiration pna
for which a Gtube was placed previously. Current presentation of
fever, productive cough, hypoxia --> consistent w/ aspiration
PNA. Given COPD and smoking history COPD flare was also
considered. Pt was initially started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for
pna but transitioned to levoquin/flagyl as he did not have
elevated white count and was afebrile during hospital admission.
Also, he was able to maintain stable respiratory status and
improved after 1 night of monitoring in the ICU. PE was
considered given history of PE s/p IVC filter however his [**Doctor Last Name 3012**]
score was quite low and it was not felt that this was high on
the differential. Steroids (prednisone 60mg) and nebs were
started.
At time of discharge he is feeling well with an ongoing mild
productive cough but no dyspnea or wheezing. He will continue PO
levofloxacin + metronidazole through [**2171-4-24**] (day 1 of
antibiotics was [**2171-4-17**]).  He will also continue a steroid taper
regimen of: prednisone 40mg x 3 days starting [**2171-4-21**], then 20mg
x 2 days starting [**4-24**], then 10mg x 2 days starting [**4-26**], then
off.
He has not weaned off oxygen yet and remains on 4L NC. We
anticipate that with steroid tapering and chest PT, he will wean
back to his baseline.
.
#chest pain - pt c/o sharp left sided chest pain resolved with
morphine in ED. Serial ECGs showed no evidence of changes and
serial cardiac enzymes negative x3. He had missed several doses
of home morphine for his chronic back pain while in the ED and
being transported and it was felt that he got behind on his pain
control. Possibly a pleuritic component of pain from pneumonia
but this was less likely. Chest pain resolved after pt was
re-initiated on home regimen of SL morphine with fentanyl patch.
.
# AMS - On arrival to the ICU was sleepy but arousable. ABG was
normal. After sleeping for roughly 30 minutes he was fully awake
and alert. He stated he was just tired from being up all night
not feeling well the night before. Electrolytes were within
normal limits. Some component of lethargy also attributed to the
2mg IV morphine he received for chest pain in the ED. Pt did
have asterixis on exam however and there was concern for
cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy, although coags and LFTs were
normal. RUQ u/s was ordered, see re gallblader mass below. Pt
also has history of depression, MS, and h/o ECT; all of which
could have predisposed him to any mental status changes by other
inciting factors.
.
# gallbladder mass - RUQ US done to eval for cirrhosis; showed
normal liver but a mass in the gallbladder.  MRCP done on [**4-19**]
was reassuring as it showed gallbladder adenomyomatosis (aka
hyperplastic cholecystosis) without concern for malignancy.
.
#dysuria - pt c/o several days of dysuria which felt to him like
his last UTI. UA neg and culture showed only bacterial growth
suggestive of skin/fecal contamination.

# Eosinophilic pneumonia vs Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**]: He is on
azathioprine, and his last visit with a pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 18**]
was in [**2170-8-13**].  He should have f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o F with a history of chronic progressive multiple
sclerosis, hypertension, anorexia nervosa, recently diagnosed
with Clostridium difficile diarrhea, represents due to a
worsening leukocytosis, anasarca, abdominal distension, and
profuse diarrhea. Per her husband she was started on
ciprofloxacin in mid- [**Month (only) 205**] and 4-5 days later started to have
profuse watery diarrhea for which her urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
provided her with imodium. The next day ([**7-11**]), she was taken to
[**Hospital3 **] because of the diarrhea and dehydration. She was found
to have moderately low blood pressures. She was given fluids and
diagnosed with c.diff. The day after admission, she had a BP of
76/51 and was transferred to the ICU. Of note during her
hospitalization her weight went from 83 lbs to 132 lbs and she
became anasarcic. Her treatment consisted of IV flagyl and PO
vanco initially. Her IV flagyl was stopped upon discharge from
[**Hospital3 **]. Her plan was to complete 14 d course of PO vanco. At
rehab, she was started on dual therapy IV vanco and flagyl. She
always denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting. She would have
intermittent abdominal pain. On [**7-18**] She was discharged to [**Hospital1 13696**] rehab where she was started on TPN. At rehab she was noted
to have an increased WBC count from 15 (on discharge from [**Hospital **]) to 29. She also had an increasingly tender abdomen so she
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further eval.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.1, P 80, BP 118/76, R 19, O2
sat 95% on 4L. She was persistently tachycardic in 110s-120s
while in the ED; did not decrease with IVFs. Patient was given
Flagyl IV 500 mg x1, Vanco 500 mg IV x1, zofran x1 and 1.5L NS
IVFs.
.
On the floor, she is feeling well. She noted shortness of breath
earlier in the day, but it has since resolved. She has no cough,
fevers, chills. No nausea, vomitting. She does not eat well,
although has been trying to drink ensure. She denies headaches,
dizziness.

           (Reference Range-Negative).

CT Abd/pelvis [**7-20**] with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal hyperenhancement and wall thickening of the left
hemicolon,
consistent with patient's history of colitis. Large amount of
ascites. No
evidence of perforation.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive lower lobe
atelectasis.

Echo [**7-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.
Large left pleural effusion.

Left upper ext ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o F with hx of MS, HTN, and anorexia who was recently
diagnosed with c.diff colitis and admittted with recurrent
diffuse watery diarrhea.
.
# C.diff Colitis: The patient has hx of c.diff colitis form
outside hospital. Upon admission, she continued to have
voluminous diarrhea output requiring rectal tube placement. The
patient was also intravascularly volume depleted secondary to
decreased PO intake and increased diarrhea output. She initially
had borderline hypotension and tachycardia to 120s, and received
IVF as well as PRBC transfustion to replete volume. The patient
was noted to have leukocyctosis, likely from inadequate
treatment of severe infection, which trened down to 21 at
discharge. CT scan was consistent with colitis, no dilation,
abscess or perforation. The patient was initially on IV flagyl
and PO vanco later changed to PO flagyl and PO vanco. She was
maintained on bowel rest in the MICU with TPN for nutrition
until diarrhea decreased, and now is briging with TPN back to a
regular diet. Her diarrhea stopped on [**2107-7-23**], and she will need
a 14 day course of these abx from this date (end date [**2107-8-6**])
and then a [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] of the vancomycin. Taper will be 125 mg
vancomycin PO BID for 7 days, followed by 125 mg PO daily for 7
days, followed by 125 mg every other day for 2 weeks.
.
.
# Anasarca: She initially developed anasarca secondary to
aggressive rehydration in the setting of hypoalbuminemia with
her initial c. diff infection. During this hospital course this
improved with Lasix 10mg IV x 2 during her stay. She has a poor
nutritional status which likely causes her anasarca. She was
continued on TPN as above. UA was negative for protein, to rule
out nephrotic syndrome. Echo was checked to rule out heart
failure, ef was normal.
.
# Anemia - patient has new anemia from baseline.  Hct of about
25 on admission, up to 29 at discharge. Likely from slow blood
loss due to colitis. Was given 1 unit of RBCs during admission.
Hct then remained stable.
.
# Tachycardia / relative hypotension: as discussed above,
secondary to volume depletion from diarrhea.  Not febrile,
lactate normal.  Do not think she has septic shock. Improved to
low 100s at dishcarge.
.
# L arm swelling: L arm slightly more swollen than R arm, is the
same arm where PICC was placed.  No erythema, intact pulses. US
of left arm showed no DVT.
.
#. lower extremity pain: The patient began complaining of
bilateral pain at back of thigh and knees on [**7-22**]. Due to high
risk for DVT in setting of immobility, bilateraly LENI's were
done and were negative for DVT. Pain improved with Tylenol and
repositioning.
.
# MS: stable, unchanging symptoms.  Neuro consulted in the ED,
followed pt. She was continued on her Oxybutinin and Impramine
at home doses. Provigil was held due to tachycardia and should
be restarted as out pt when appropriate.
.
# HTN: SBPs stable in 100s, holding antihypertensives for now.
Valsartan and quinapril should be restarted as outpatient when
appropriate.
.
# Anorexia: long standing issue (for >20 years). Was restarted
on TPN prior to admission. Continued on TPN during her hospital
course. Changed to cycled TPN during nights only to encourge
appetite. Meals were supplemented with Ensure.
.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] rehab on [**2107-7-25**].

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
59yo woman with 30 year history of multiple sclerosis presents
after fall in her bathroom [**1-26**] (the night prior to admission).
 She reports slipping on the water that had dropped on the tile
while brushing her teeth.  She denies palpitations, chest pain,
or lightheadedness prior to her fall.  She hit her right orbit
and her chin upon falling, then spent about 12 hours trying to
get up.  Eventually, a neighbor walked by and she managed to
call out and get her attention.

She initially presented to an OSH, where she was found to have a
small subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT, prompting transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Vitals on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED were:  98.2   93/62
92   16   98% RA.  Repeat head CT showed a small SAH in the left
frontal lobe; no evidence of midline shift or mass effect.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and felt that there was no acute
neurosurgical issue, so they signed off.  She was given 4L of
normal saline per their records, but unclear how much she
absorbed.

On review of systems, she denies recent illness or flare of her
MS, fevers, palpitations, chest pain, headache, dyspnea,
dysuria, or loss of consciousness.  She does note that her right
arm and both legs (R>L) are weak at baseline and that she
sometimes has constipation or frequent stools from her MS.  She
does c/o back pain, knee pain, and elbow pain from where she hit
the floor and abdominal pain from using her muscles to try to
get up.  She reports falling 3 times in the last year, but never
as seriously as this.

Past Medical History:
Multiple sclerosis since her late 20s; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31464**]
from ""[**Street Address(2) 3375**]""

the building.  + tobacco [**1-31**] to 1 PPD x 40 years, quit drinking
in her 30s; denies illicit drug use.  No pets.  She does not
have a life alert.

Upon arrival in MICU:  NSR, flat T waves in inferolateral leads,
ST depressions in V3 and V4.

Imaging on admission:
CXR [**1-27**]:
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated.  There is mild cardiomegaly.
 The lateral view raises the possibility of an infiltrate in the
lower lobe posteriorly. However, no focal infiltrate is detected
on the frontal view.  There is upper zone redistribution,
without overt CHF.  No frank consolidation or effusion is
identified.

CT Head without contrast [**1-27**]:
A small focus of high attenuation is seen in the left frontal
lobe sulcus, most suggestive of trace subarachnoid blood.  No
hemorrhage is identified elsewhere. There is no hydrocephalus,
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  No major
vascular territorial infarct is apparent.  The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
No fracture is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo woman with h/o multiple sclerosis and multiple falls
presents with mechanical fall, on ground x 12 hours. Most likely
mechanical in setting of weakness from chronic progressive MS.
[**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to the injury her CK was elevated with peak of 5500 for
which she received IV fluids with normal urine output and kidney
function. Potassium, Calcium and phosphate were low during the
course and needed to be repleted.

She also had a difficult to explain elevation of troponin
without cardiac symptoms or EKG findings. She was monitored on
telemetry overnight for evidence of arrhythmias, which she did
not have.

She was found to have a small subarachnoid bleed, for which
neurosurgery was consulted. Bleed remained stable and no
intervention was thought to be necessary. Her neuro exam
remained at baseline and unchanged.
.
Leukocytosis: Most likely secondary to stress of fall, but
infectious processes also thought to be possible.  She did not
have a fever but developed some low grade temperature, without
any symptoms. UA and blood culture remained negative, and CXR
suggestive of possible infiltrate, but no symptoms of pneumonia.


With regard to her MS she was treated with prednisone in the
past which she did not tolerate. She currently is not on any
medication, which has been confirmed by her [**Name13 (STitle) 850**] Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31464**].

History of Present Illness:
49 year old female h/o MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was at her PCP's office
today when she had sudden onset of headache and right
hemiplegia.
The patient was sent to OSH where she was intubated and given
mannitol. Her SBP was 192 at the OSH and she was given lasix and
labetolol. She was then sent here and her repeat head CT shows
increased amount of hemorrhage and increased shift. The
patient's
SBP is currently 129 and she has just received 50 grams of
mannitol per neurology. Neurosurgery was called to see the
patient STAT for anisocoria and herniation.

Pertinent Results:
HEAD CT [**5-9**]: There are two large likely contiguous areas of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage one centered at the left basal
ganglia (2:15) measuring 5.4 x 3.6 and a second in the left
parietal lobe measuring 4.4 x 4.3 cm. Compared to the study
performed approximately three hours prior, these areas of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage have significantly increased in
size. There is moderate hypodensity surrounding these
intraparenchymal hemorrhagic areas, likely due to edema. There
is resulting compression of the left lateral ventricle with
10-mm leftward shift, likely subfalcine herniation. There is
mild obliteration of the left prepontine cistern, likely
representing mild uncal herniation. Hemorrhagic material is seen
layering in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] (2:13). Hyperdense material
is seen along the right frontal convexity (2:24 through 2:21)
representing subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is mild sulcal
effacement along the left hemisphere. No areas of territorial
infarction identified. Osseous structures appear normal and
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain well aerated. The
hemorrhagic area in the left parietal lobe (2:22) may
demonstrate a fluid-fluid level suggestive of acute on subacute
hemorrhage.

CTA HEAD [**5-9**]: In the area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
previously described are several hyperdense foci representing
""spot signs"" and are concerning for active extravasation. These
are best seen (3:103, 3:99). A linear area of hyperdensity seen
traversing through the area of hemorrhage (3:91) could represent
an area of active extravasation or a vessel which does not
appear to be contiguous with any surrounding intracranial
vessel. The distal branches of the left MCA are displaced by
this large intraparenchymal hemorrhage, however, there is no
evidence for occlusion or stenosis of any intracranial vessel.
No evidence for aneurysm or AVM is seen. Incidental note is made
of a diminutive left vertebral artery and diminutive right
posterior communicating artery.

IMPRESSION:
1. Massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving region of the
left basal
ganglia and left parietal lobes with multiple foci of ""spot
sign"" concerning for areas of active extravasation. Surrounding
vasogenic edema.
2. No evidence for AVM or aneurysm, although adjacent
intracranial vessels
are displaced by this intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No vascular
occlusion.
3. Significant mass effect caused by this enlarging
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage causing 10-mm rightward subfalcine herniation and
possible left
uncal herniation.

Repeat Head CT [**5-9**]:
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left
basal ganglia and temporoparietal lobes has increased in size,
measuring up to 7.5 x 4.9 cm on axial imaging (2:17), previously
measuring 5.7 x 3.6 cm at a similar level. There is increased
extension of the hemorrhage into the ventricles, now filling the
right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], layering in the left
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and also seen in the fourth ventricle. There is
also
scattered subarachnoid component, with blood now seen within the
basal
cisterns. There is increased sulcal effacement, without sparing
only along
the anterior and superior convexity of the right frontal lobe.
There is
increased rightward shift of normally midline structures, from
10 mm to 14 mm, with rightward subfalcine herniation. There is
increased left-sided uncal herniation. In addition, there is
appearance of a trapped ventricles, with enlargement of both of
the lateral ventricles, which is slightly more apparent than the
right as the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is effaced. The soft tissues,
orbits, and skull appear intact. The visualized mastoid air
cells and paranasal sinuses remain well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Since the study performed six hours prior, there is
interval
increase in size of left cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with increased mass effect with rightward subfalcine herniation,
increased left uncal herniation, and new appearance of trapped
ventricles due to the increased size of the hemorrhage as well
as increased edema.

Cerebral angiogram [**5-9**]:
no report at the time of this writing but the physician told the
neurosurgery team that there was no evidence of AVM/aneurysm


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was evaluated in the ER by neurology and
neurosurgery was called when she starting developing anisocoria.
Her head CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed increased hemorrhage compared to the
scan from the OSH. The patient had right hemiplegia but was
moving the left side spontaneously. She was given mannitol at
the OSH and was given another dose per neurology when her pupils
became unequal. The patient had a CTA which showed some vessels
going through the site of the hemorrhage and it was unclear if
there were any abnormalites. Therefore, the patient was sent for
a formal angiogram which showed no aneurysm or AVM. She was
admitted to the ICU for Q 1 hour neuro checks, continuation of
medical management. Due to the left sided hemorrhage, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
did not offer any surgery because chances for a meaningful
recovery after such a significant hemorrhage were very low. This
was explained to her husband in the emergency room. The plan was
to continue to do neuro checks and serial head CT scans.

Unfortunately, upon repeat imaging later that night, the
hemorrhage had again increased in size with continued
herniation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] again spoke to the family and discussed
the possibility of [**Last Name (STitle) 3225**] and extubation and the likelihood that
the patient may become brain dead in the near future. Early in
the morning on [**2170-5-10**] the patient's family came in to see her.
We had a family meeting with the social worker at the bedside.
The patient's husband and father agreed to make her [**Name (NI) 3225**]. They
also wanted her to be an organ donor since she had expressed
those wishes in the past and had it indicated on her driver's
license.

The organ bank representatives spoke to the family and the
decsion was made to keep the patient intubated until a possible
organ procurement could occur but that she would otherwise be
given comfort measures. We stopped all unneccessary medications
and kept her comfortable. She received antiseizure medications
and was kept sedated. Later in the day she was extubated. The
patient died at 2:35 in the morning on [**2170-5-11**]. She was no
longer a candidate for organ donation because of hypoperfusion
of the organs.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo woman with MS who presented from [**Hospital **] rehab with
hyperkalemia, now with fever, elevated lactate.
.
# Fever: Multiple possible sources, given elevated lactate
concerning for sepsis though BP relatively stable, not
tachycardic, normal WBC. Urine culture from OSH positive for
Proteus and Serratia, cefepime sensitive UTI although the
patient has a chronic indwelling foley difficult so this could
be colonization. CXR significant for RRL collapse, likely
complicated by a PNA. Underwent Bronchoscopy on [**11-30**] and had
thick secretions suctioned. The following day her CXR showed
mild improvement, with better visualization of her right heart
border.  Sputum from OSH positive for Pseudomonas with
sensitivies pending.  Plastics saw her decubs, felt that they
were chronic and not contributing to her fevers. Has staghorn
calculi bilaterally by KUB - urology consulted and did not feel
that these were contributing to her acute picture and could be
followed as an outpatient.  The patient was placed on cefepime
and will continue a 15 day course.
.
# Hyperkalemia/Hypokalemia: Unclear etiology, after treatment
with kayexelate improved to 3.9. She then became hypokalemic the
following day, requiring potassium supplementation. Cr  was in
normal range but may be elevated for her given chronic
immobility. Consider obstructing stone with hydronephrosis vs.
hemolysis. No concerning changes on ECG.  Urology was consulted
for lithotripsy - did not recommend inpatient procedure,
outpatient appointment scheduled for [**Month (only) 404**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] at
[**Hospital1 2177**].
.
# Sacral decubitus and left hip ulcers: Plastics feels they are
chronic as above no acute intervention was felt to be warranted.
The patient was given a kinair bedand wound care reccomendations
were followed.
 .
# Staghorn calculi: Likely infected (proteus). She was continued
on cefepime. Proteus not sensitive to cipro per OSH cultures.
Urology consult reccommended no intervention at this time. She
has an outpatient appointment scheduled for [**Month (only) 404**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**] at [**Hospital1 2177**].
.
# Chronic respiratory failure: She remained stable and wa
maintained on her current vent settings.
.
# Hypertension: On metoprolol, captopril at baseline. Unknown if
she has autonomic dysregulation with MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 106168**]
were held and restarted at discharge.
.
# COPD: Her atrovent/albuterol was continued.
.
# Anemia: Unknown baseline hct, microcytic. Continued iron
supplementation and monitored for acute blood loss.
.
# DM: Continued home regimen of lantus and SSRI, monitored BG,
well-controlled on current regimen
.
# FEN: Tube feeds per Nutrition consult. Monitored and repleted
lytes prn.

46756,"Admission Date:  [**2102-7-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-8-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2057-11-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
female with multiple sclerosis and a history of tracheostomy
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in
[**2093**] who developed hematuria one day prior to admission.  She
received one dose of Levaquin at home and had a slight fever.
Then, at 10 p.m. one day prior to admission, she became more
lethargic, and her blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable
(usually 130s/90s).  Otherwise, no other localizing symptoms.

Between Emergency Medical Service and the Emergency Room, she
received 400 cc of normal saline.  On arrival, her blood
pressure was 215/131.  The patient became hypoxic with an
oxygen saturation of 80% and a respiratory rate of 20.  A
respiratory rate dropped to 26 and became agonal.  Attempts
to bag the patient with AMBI bag, but ventilation was
ineffective secondary to no cuff in the trachea.

In the Emergency Room, the tracheostomy was attempted to be
removed; however, this was unsuccessful.  It had never been
removed in the past nine years.  Breathing was shallow and
rapid.  White blood cell count was 36.2.  A chest x-ray
revealed no infiltrates seen.  An arterial blood gas was
drawn and revealed pH was 7.19, CO2 was 88, and oxygen was
106.  The patient's tracheostomy was attached to the
ventilation, and on ventilation the arterial blood gas
improved to a pH of 7.36, CO2 of 50, and oxygen of 318;
however, her blood pressure dropped to the 70s with no
response to wide-open fluids.  Peripheral Neo-Synephrine was
then started, and right subclavian catheter was placed.  The
subclavian catheter actually went up the left internal
jugular, and so had to be changed over wire, and is currently
correctly positioned.  Subsequently, the Neo-Synephrine was
then re-routed to go through the central venous access.  An
arterial line was placed on the day of admission as well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 102.6, blood pressure was 157/115,
heart rate was 97, respiratory rate was 19, and oxygen
saturation was 70%.  In general, the patient was trached and
not responding; however, the family reports this was the
patient's bowel sounds.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the mucous membranes were moist.  A cut
on the tongue.  The neck examination revealed a tracheostomy
with no erythema or exudate.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed tachycardia.  No murmurs or rubs.  Otherwise, a
regular rhythm.  Lung examination revealed very shallow quick
breaths and a few scattered bronchial sounds.  The abdomen
revealed good bowel sounds and was soft.  Distended and
tympanic.  The family reports this was the patient's
baseline.  Extremity examination revealed extremities were
warm.  No decubitus ulcerations.  No spontaneous movement of
extremities except eyes closing.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 36.2, hematocrit was 44.4, and platelets were
562.  Electrolytes revealed sodium was 131, potassium was
4.6, chloride was 91, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen
was 16, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 155.
Urinalysis revealed large amounts of blood, 500 mg/dL of
protein, and moderate leukocytes, more than 50 red blood
cells, more than 50 white blood cells, a few bacteria, and no
yeast.  Microbiology history:  In [**2101-10-11**], there was
a urine cultures which grew out Pseudomonas which was
sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin (which it was
resistant to).  It also grew out pan-sensitive enterococcus.
In [**2100**], urine culture grew out pan-sensitive enterococcus.
In [**2099**], urine culture grew out ampicillin-resistant
Escherichia coli, cefuroxime intermediate and Pseudomonas
resistant to ciprofloxacin.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: A chest x-ray revealed a left
lower lobe streak ?.

Electrocardiogram revealed no acute ST-T wave changes per
baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  Hypotension most likely due to
urosepsis with a urinalysis showing a high white blood cells
and moderate leukocyte esterase with a white blood cell count
of 36.2.  The patient was started on phenylephrine drip on
the day of admission ([**7-29**]) which was discontinued later
on during the day due to resolving hypotension.

2.  UROSEPSIS ISSUES:  The patient was started on ceftazidime
2 g intravenously q.8h. and metronidazole 500 mg
intravenously q.8h.  Urinalysis showed signs of urinary tract
infection.  Urine culture from the [**7-29**] grew out
enterococcus pan-sensitive to ampicillin, levofloxacin, and
vancomycin.  The patient was originally started on vancomycin
to treat enterococcus until these sensitivities came back
from enterococcus being sensitive to ampicillin.  Thus,
vancomycin was discontinued on [**8-2**] and ampicillin was
started.

Urosepsis resolving, and the patient was afebrile throughout
her hospital course.  White blood cell count dropped to 13.4.
There was a question of a fistula in the urinary system;
however, Urology was consulted and upon the methylene blue
study there was found to be no vesicovaginal fistula.
Additionally, Clostridium difficile was negative times two;
taken from stool cultures.

The patient received a computed tomography of the abdomen and
pelvis with and without contrast which did not show any signs
of free fluid or abscess collection.

3.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was ventilated
on [**7-29**] and [**7-30**] and was then able to be weaned from
the ventilator, and is currently saturating well on an FIO2
of 50% through her tracheostomy.

The patient went to the operating room on [**8-2**] for a
trachea change.  A new tracheostomy was put in place, and the
old tracheostomy was removed.

Additionally, sputum from [**7-29**] grew out Pseudomonas
sensitive to everything but ciprofloxacin.  Thus, ceftazidime
was to be continued to complete a 14-day course.

The patient received a computed tomography of the trachea
without contrast and with reconstruction prior to going to
the operating room for tracheostomy removal and replacement
with a new tracheostomy.

4.  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ISSUES:  The patient was to continue
Baclofen.

5.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit was 44.4 on
admission and dropped to 34.8 on the same day of admission;
progressively decreasing to 31.7 on [**8-2**].   No signs of
active bleeding.  Negative hemolysis laboratories.  Most
likely due to blood draws.

6.  HYPONATREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's sodium decreased from
133 on admission to dip down to 126 on [**8-1**], but then
increased back up to 132 on [**8-2**].  This was most likely
due to hypovolemia as the patient's sodium level responded to
intravenous infusion of normal saline.  Other electrolytes
were repleted as needed; such as phosphate and magnesium.
The patient without to resume tube feeds with ProMod with
fiber.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient received prophylactic
care of H2 blockers, subcutaneous heparin, and pneumo boots.

8.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code, and communication
was kept with the husband who visited frequently.

9.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient will also need intravenous
access for continuation of antibiotics at home for the
enterococcus in the urine and the Pseudomonas in the sputum
(i.e. the tracheobronchitis).  The patient was to be
evaluated today for a peripherally inserted central catheter
placement to complete a 14-day course of ampicillin for
enterococcus and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged after
peripherally inserted central catheter line placement.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Respiratory distress with urosepsis enterococcus.
2.  Tracheobronchitis Pseudomonas.

SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS:  Tracheostomy tube changed in the
operating room on [**8-2**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Ceftazidime 2 g intravenously q.8h. (for nine days).
2.  Ampicillin 1 g intravenously q.6h. (for eleven days).

The patient was to continue all her home medications; which I
have verified with her home nurse that she has refills of
these medications at home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with her primary care physician as needed.

215/131.  The patient became hypoxic with an 02 sat of 80 and
a respiratory rate of 20.  Suction and respiratory rate
dropped to 26 and became agonal.  Attempts to bag patient
with Ambu-bag, but ventilation was ineffective secondary to
no cuff in the trachea.  In the Emergency Room the trach was
attempted to be removed, however, was unable and had never
been removed in the past nine years.  Breathing was shallow

then started and a right subclavian catheter was placed.  The
subclavian catheter went up the left IJ and so had to be
changed over a wire and is now correctly positioned.
Subsequently neo was then rerouted to go through the central
venous access.  An A line was placed the day of admission as
well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 102.6.  Blood pressure

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The

surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission - Because the patient has multiple
co-morbidities and lost a fair amount of blood intraoperatively,
Mr [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation.  He
remained intubated for approximately 18 hours after surgery.  He
was hypotensive.  He responded well to blood transfusion and
fluid resusitation.  He was extubated and doing well when
transferred to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name **] on POD 1.

2. Post-op delerium - on the night of POD 1 and into POD 2, Mr
[**Known lastname **] was noted to be paranoid, confused, and anxious.  He was
unable to verbalize the causes for this.  Consults for medicine
and social work were called.  His medication was adjusted -
psychotropics and narcotics were minimized.  On POD 3, he was
clear and coherent.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with IV dilaudid
followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#2.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis pre-operatively for one
week prior to surgery and was restarted on this on the morning
of POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#3 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean

and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout

the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity. Posterior hip precautions.
 No active abduction x 6 weeks


Mr [**Known lastname **] is discharged to rehab in stable condition with
prescriptions for lovenox and dilaudid.

History of Present Illness:
58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with repeated admissions
this month for AMS who was admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for
confusion after a fall and found to have UTI and bil DVT and is
now transffered to us primarily for continuous EEG monitoring
d/t continued AMS.
.
At baseline pnt is mostly wheelchair bound, but is able to walk
a few steps with a walker and transfer independently, mentates
normally and is able to care for her affairs.
.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**] ON
[**2109-1-24**] for UTI and became delirious at that point.  However,
her delirium did improve and she was alert and oriented upon
discharge. transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2109-1-23**].  She was
at for less than a day, at which point she was transferred back
to [**Hospital3 1196**] with altered mental status where
she was discharged on [**1-26**] back to rehab. Details of this
[**Month/Year (2) **] are unclear. She then presented [**2-6**] to [**Hospital3 **]
from nursing home due to a fall which she said was [**3-14**] to
neglecting to lock her wheelchair when she was trying to get off
it.  She fell backwards and sustained a occipital scalp
hematoma, there was no loss of consciousness, no incontinence,
tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**] or limb movements.  Per nursing home report, the
patient was confused after the fall.
.
At [**Hospital3 **] was reported to have intermitent confusion with
peridos in which she is able to converse and cooperate. Kepra
was started overnight for ? of seizures.  Today she became
progressively more lethargic to the point of awakening only to
noxiuous stimuli.  Noncontrast head CT showed atrophy but no
acute findings. MRI scan was limited d/t movement and showed
[**Known lastname 1007**] matter findings consistent with multiple sclerosis, but
could not absolutely r/o infarction. EEG show generalized
slowing and some high-amplitude sharp activity which was felt to
be consistent with an encephalopathy, although seizure could not
be ruled out. All centerally acting medications including
baclofen and keppra. She was  given IV acyclovir empirically on
day of transfer. LP was performed prior to transfer, initial and
showed: gluc 63, prot 47, gram stain neg, RBC 2140 1st tube 20
4th tube, no xanthrchromia, WBC = 5, 5.
.
.
She also reported increased swelling bilaterally in her lower
extremities over past few months left > right, limiting her
mobility.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, headache, focal numbness or weakness. LENI
demonstarted DVT in the left common femoral and proper femoral
veins +  clot was also seen in the right common femoral vein.
She has no family or personal h/o DVT. She denied any CP or SOB.
VQ scan was was interpreted as very low probability for
pulmonary embolism. Echo showed mild-mod TR and minimal PHTN
(28mmHg) w/o RV strain. IV heparin was started + coumadin. Then
reversed for LP and IVC filter was placed.
.
Also UTI was diagnosed per dirty UA, patient received 3 days of
ciprofloxacin which was stopped d/t AMS. Unkown if positive
cultures.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2109-2-12**]):
1. Large pelvic masses that are mainly composed of soft tissue
but have some cystic components within them.  Bilateral
hydronephrosis is detected secondary to external compression of
the ureters by the pelvis masses.
Omental caking and peritoneal seeding are seen along with
malignant ascites. These findings are most probably related to
primary ovarian carcinoma.
.
2. IVC filter is well positioned, filling defects that are
compatible with
DVT are seen in the right common iliac vein. The right external
iliac vein is obliterated. Filling defects are seen in the left
common femoral vein and left superficial femoral vein. The left
iliac veins are not well visualized.
.
Paracentesis ([**2109-2-14**]): Technically successful ultrasound-guided
diagnostic paracentesis Preliminary Reportwith 850 mL of clear
serous fluid removed. No immediate complication. Cytology
consistent with adenocarcinoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for [**Month/Day/Year **]: 58 year old F with Multiple
Sclerosis with repeated admissions this month for AMS who was
admitted to [**Location **] [**2-6**] for confusion after a fall and
found to have UTI and bilateral DVTs transferred for continuous
EEG monitoring d/t continued AMS found to have widespread
ovarian cancer.
.
Active Problems:
.
# AMS/Delirium: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy given
marked improvement with antibiotics and EEG consistent with
generalized encephalopathy and no e/o seizure or epileptiform
activity. She was initially A/O x0, arousable but minimally
verbal, only responsive with echolalia. After initiating
appropriate antibiotic therapy for enterococcus UTI, her mental
status rapidly improved. There was initially concern for
bacterial/viral meningitis/encephalitis and LP was performed at
[**Hospital3 **]. CSF showed Tot Protein 47, Glucose 63, RBC 2140
(Tube 1), RBC 20 (Tube 4), likely representative of a traumatic
tap. HSV PCR and Cryptococcal antigen were negative. Bacterial
cultures were negative and antibiotics were narrowed and
acyclovir was discontinued. MRI was also performed at [**Hospital3 2568**]
and showed periventricular [**Known lastname **] matter changes consistent with
MS. On the floor her mental status rapidly improved, though she
contined to wax and wane with occasional hallucinations and
inappropriate responses to questioning, intersperced with
periods of lucidity consistent with delerium. RPR was negative
and TFTs were normal. At the time of discharge, she was A/Ox3
and able to engange in conversation, though occasionally
confused.
.
# DVT: Pt with b/l DVTs, for which she was started on Heparin
gtt and Warfarin. She also had an IVC filter placed at [**Hospital3 10959**], as she needed to be reversed for urgent LP. CT C/A/P was
performed due to concern for malignancy or IVC clot and showed a
large pelvic mass with widespread peritoneal metastases
consistent with advanced ovarian cancer. Warfarin and Heparin
were stopped and she was placed on therapeutic doses of Loveonx.
She should be continued on Lovenox shots as prescribed for at
least the next 6 months with consideration given to lifelong
anticoagulation given her known hypercoagulable state.
.
# Ovarian Cancer: Large pelvic mass with associated ascites,
omental caking peritoneal seeding and pleural effusion were seen
on CT scan. Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed and
cells were sent for cytology. Ca-125 was 2614. Ascitic fluid was
exudative, consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Cytology
showed adenocarcinoma and Heme/Onc was consulted. She will
follow up as an outpatient for management of her malignancy.
Final staining for pathology is pending at discharge.
.
# Bleed: Pt's HCT dropped 28->23 s/p paracentesis in the setting
of anticoagulation with Lovenox. For this she was transfused 1U
pRBCs with appropriate response in her HCT from 23->28. Her HCT
remained stable for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# UTI: She was found to have UTI at [**Hospital3 2568**] and placed on
Cipro, which was stopped after 3d due to worsening mental
status. At [**Hospital1 18**] she was given Ceftriaxone; urine culture grew
enterococcus sensitive to Ampicillin and Ceftriacxone was
stopped and she was given a 7d course of Ampicillin. Ampicillin
was continued due to her recurrent UTIs and hospital admissions
for AMS; she will require lifelong Ampicillin prophylaxis and
should continue q6h straight cath for her neurogenic bladder.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt with elevated Cr. Initial concern was for pre-renal
failure given poor PO intake and she was given IVF without
improvement. CT C/A/P was then performed and showed a large
pelvic mass compressing the bilateral ureters and mild bilateral
hydronephrosis. Her Cr and electrolytes were monitored and her
Cr remained stable (1.2-1.3) throughout her course.
.
# Atonic Bladder: At baseline pt straight caths herself for
atonic bladder due to MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] she had an
indwelling foley. This was d/c'ed upon arrival to the floor and
she was straight cath'ed q6h for the remainder of her hospital
course.
.
# Tachycardia: Likely [**3-14**] hypermetabolic state given widespread
ovarian cancer. She was most tachycardic immediatley prior to
her Metoprolol doses. Given this, her Metoprolol was changed
from 50mg po bid to 37.5mg po tid with imprvement in her
tachycardia.
.
# Malnutrition: Nutrition was consulted and recommended Ensure
supplements with meals. As her mental status improved, her PO
intake also improved. At the time of discharge she was
tolerating POs and eating 3 full meals per day.
.
Chronic Problems:
.
# MS: Current presentation unlikely due to MS flare.
.
Transitional Issues: Pt was d/c'ed with Heme/Onc and GYN/Onc
follow up. Her brother, [**Name (NI) **] is involved in her care and will
be present at her appointments to facilitate discussion of her
options moving forward.

[**2181-7-20**] MRSA Screen: Negative

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 year old man with MS, on self-catheterization
regimen at home with hx of recurrent UTIs, who presented to the
ED on [**7-19**] with lethargy, high fevers, tachycardia, elevated
lactate, and gram negative rods growing out of urine and blood
cultures (later speciated as ESBL E. Coli).  He was resuscitated
in ICU while receiving zosyn, with marked improvement.

# Urosepsis: Patient presented with fever >104, WBC <2,000, RR
26, HR 120, (+)UA, MS changes and lactate of 7 meeting criteria
for severe sepsis.  After fluid resucitation and initial
antibiotic the patient's condition greatly improved as his MS
returned to baseline, his HR and RR decreased to WNL, his
lactate returned to [**Location 213**] levels and his temperature decreased
to WNL.  His urine speciated ESBL E. Coli sensitive to Zosyn.
He received additional hydration in the ICU, but did not require
pressors.  He was stable on arrival to the floor and was
maintained on IV zosyn.  Surveillance cultures drawn [**7-21**], [**7-22**],
[**7-23**] were negative.  A PICC line was placed on [**2181-7-24**], and he
was discharged to a rehab facility where he can complete the
course of IV zosyn.  We recommended he stop his prophylactic
regimen of Methenamine Hippurate until completion of his zosyn
course, at which point he can resume it.  Regarding prophylaxis,
this patient needs more extensive services at home to prevent
recurrent UTIs.

# Acute renal failure: Patient presented with Cr 1.3 from a
baseline of 0.8. This likely represents pre-renal azotemia in
the setting of sepsis and hypovolemia.  On [**2181-7-21**] his Cr. was
0.7.

# Left hip wound: Patient states it is due to a fall 1 month
ago. It is unhealed despite VNA care. It was deemed an unlikely
source of infection given history of UTIs and (+) UA.  Plain
radiographs did not show any evidence of osteomyelitis.  On the
floor, wound team continued to consult.  They recommended Q72H
cleaning with sterile normal saline followed by duoderm and
mepalex dressings.

# Multiple sclerosis.  The patient endorsed stiffness and
spasticity consistent with his recent baseline.  He was
continued on his home medications.  His baclofen pump does not
need maintenance until late [**Month (only) **].  PT saw him while on the
floor and recommended further therapy at the rehabilitation
center.

# Hyperlipidemia:  This issue was stable.  He was continued on
his home medications.

# Depression:  This issue was stable.  He was continued on his
home medications.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Healthcare Center - [**Location (un) **]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase E. Coli urinary tract
infection, Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase E. Coli bacteremia,
Acute Kidney Injury, Left hip wound
Secondary: Multiple sclerosis


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.


Discharge Instructions:
You were brought to the hospital on [**2181-7-19**] after waking up with
fevers, chills, and lethargy.  On arrival to the emergency room
you were found to have evidence of active infection including
high fevers, a rapid pulse, and fast respiratory rate.  Labs
showed infection in your bladder and in your blood, along with
evidence of some kidney injury.  You were given a significant
amount of fluid through your IV along with antibiotics.  Within
24 hours, your symptoms were largely resolved and your kidney
function had normalized.  As your blood infection requires
additional intravenous antibiotics, we placed a PICC
(peripherally inserted central catheter).  As you will need
assistance to administer these medications, we have arranged
transfer to a rehab facility.  Staff at the rehab facility will
continue to care for your left hip wound as well.

Please note the following changes to your regular medications:
- Please continue to take the zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam)
through [**2181-7-30**] to complete a 10 day course.
- Please continue to take docusate sodium twice daily as you
have had some constipation.  Bisacodyl and senna are also
included in your discharge medications; you can request these as
required for constipation.
- Please stop taking the Methenamine Hippurate until you have
completed your course of zosyn; you can resume it at that point.
- Please take the rest of your medications as you did prior to
your admission.

- Please follow up with your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 7476**],[**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7477**] on

   Blood Culture, No Growth to date at discharge.

RADIOLOGY STUDIES:
 - [**2181-9-16**] Plain films: No radiographic evidence for
osteomyelitis. If continued clinical concern for a bone
infection, further evaluation with MRI is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**] was admitted with urosepsis related to his
intermittent self-catheterizations. He was initially treated in
the ICU with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and vasoactive pressors for
hypotension; he was never intubated. His blood and urine
cultures returned ESBL E coli and he was strated on meropenem on
[**2181-9-13**]. He continued to improve and was transitioned to the
floor. He will complete a 2 week course of meropenem on
[**2181-9-26**]. He will then need to restart his methenamine
hippurate for suppressive therapy. Other active issues in the
intensive care unit included acute renal failure that improved
with supportive therapy and multiple decubitus ulcers.
Management of the decubitus ulcers and other chronic medical
problems outlined below.

1. left greater trochanter ulcers
 -  on exam, these ulcers appear to be superficial and hip films
were without evidence of osteomyelitis. MRI was not pursued
given the above exam finding
 - wound care: wound cleanser and Mepilex dressing every 3 days

2. Multiple sclerosis:
 - continued on his baclofen pump and continued with physical
therapy

3. Urinary retention
 - Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**] has a specific type of catheter he uses for
self-catheterization. We were unable to obtain these and given
his recent injury he was unwilling to utilize a different sized
catheter. As soon as his regular catheters can be obtained, he
should have his Foley catheter removed to prevent further
infections.

4. Hyperlipidemia: continued ezetimibe

5. Depression:  continued fluoxetine

Patient confirmed he is full code during this hospitalization

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**],

You were admitted with a urinary tract infection and a blood
stream infection. These happen sometimes with your straight
catheterizations. You improved with IV antibiotics. You will
need a total of 14 days of meropenem to treat this severe
infection and your last dose will be [**2181-9-26**].

We made no other changes to your medications though you will
need to restart your methenamine on [**2181-9-27**] after the meropenem
is complete.

It is also very important that you have your Foley catheter
removed as soon as possible to prevent further infections. You
can either order new straight catheters or have someone bring
you some from home.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-9**] weeks after discharge
from your rehab hospital.

[**2117-2-18**] CT Torso :
1. Pulmonary contusions within the anterior aspect of the left
lung without evidence of a pneumothorax.
2. Left anterior first rib fracture.
3. Transverse fracture of the superior L3 vertebral body with
small superior and anterior fracture fragment and slight
retropulsion of the dominant superior fracture fragment into the
central spinal canal. This finding, in conjunction with mild
widening of the L2 and L3 spinous processes, raises concern for
a Chance-type fracture. Recommend further evaluation with MRI to
assess for ligamentous injury when clinically appropriate, given
the patient's other acute injuries.

[**2117-2-18**] CT Right leg :
1. Transverse fractures of the distal tibial and fibular
diaphyses, with
moderate displacement and apex posterior angulation.
2. Comminuted fracture of the distal tibia, with intra-articular
extension
into tibiotalar and distal tibiofibular joints.
3. Extensively comminuted calcaneal fracture, with moderately
severe lateral displacement, and intra-articular extension into
the middle and posterior subtalar joints, sinus tarsi, and
possibly the calcaneocuboid joint.
4. Small avulsion fracture at the distal lateral malleolus, with
fracture
fragments seen directly adjacent to the peroneal tendons.

[**2117-2-18**] CTA Head :
1. Irregular narrowing of the bilateral cervical internal
carotid artery.
While these findings are concerning for arterial dissection, no
dissection
flap is seen. When clinically appropriate, this could be further
evaluated
with MRI, including T1 Fat-saturated sequence.
2. Probable hypoplastic left sigmoid sinus. However, a fracture
extends into this and the possibility of sinus thrombosis is not
excluded. When clinically appropriate, this also can be further
evaluated with MRI.
3. Redemonstration of intracranial injuries included basilar
skull fractures and subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no new
mass effect.

[**2117-2-18**] Right arm :
1. Distal radial fracture-dislocation at the distal radius;
carpus and distal radial fracture fragment dislocated dorsally
with respect to distal radial shaft.
2. Dislocated distal radioulnar joint.
3. Probable distal ulnar fracture, incompletely characterized
due to cast.

[**2117-2-18**] Head CT :
1. ICP bolt via right frontal approach ends in the anterior
right frontal
lobe.
2. Stable appearance of predominantly left-sided subarachnoid
hemorrhage and subdural hematomas along the tentorium and the
left frontotemporal region are unchanged since the previous
study. No new areas of acute hemorrhage are identified.
3. Diffuse cerebral edema as before.
4. Fractures of the posterior clivus, sphenoid sinus, and
occiput are
unchanged.

[**2117-2-20**] MRI L spine :
1. Extensive vertebral bone marrow edema corresponding to the
known
burst-type fracture involving the L3 superior endplate with
slight
anteropulsion of its anterior-superior corner fragment, but no
significant
retropulsion, spinal canal compromise or loss of vertebral body
height.
2. Though there is edema extending into the posterior elements,
right more
than left, with associated patchy edema in the overlying
multifidus muscle, there is no discrete posterior element
fracture or ligamentous injury to suggest a Chance-type
fracture-equivalent.
3. Linear bone marrow edema involving the junction of the L4
superior
endplate and the remainder of this vertebral body, likely
representing a
second impaction fracture; however, there is no associated loss
of height,
retropulsion or spinal canal compromise.
4. Normal appearance of the conus medullaris and cauda equina
nerve roots.

[**2117-2-21**] CT Head :
 Little overall change in appearance of subdural, and
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Stable cerebral edema. Unchanged
clival, sphenoidal, and occipital fractures.



Brief Hospital Course:
Evaluated by trauma, ortho, hand, neurosurgery. Intubated in
TSICU for increasing agitation, desaturations. Open distal ulna
fracture on left reduced by hand, splinted. Neurosurgery placed
bolt at bedside, then patient proceeded to OR with orthopedics
for distal radius washout/ORIF. Bolt was exchanged since this
first was not [**Location (un) 1131**]. On HD 2, The patient then went to OR for
orthopedic repair of ankle, and subsequent bolt replacement by
neurosurgery in OR. A right subclavian TLC placed. On HD 3, the
ICP bolt was removed and an IVC filter placed. Pt was extubated
on HD 4, and her home pain medication regimen was restarted. Her
pain was controlled with dilaudid PCA on top of home oxycontin.
Pt remained confused at times and delirious at night, requiring
antipsychotic medications. This was likely in part due to over
medication with pain medications, so her pain regimen was
reduced. Pt was stable for transfer to the Trauma floor on
[**2117-2-24**].

Following transfer she continued to make good progress.  Her
confusion resolved after removing her PCA and her pain was
adequately controlled with Oxycodone and Oxycontin.  She was
able to get out of bed with her [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar on as well as her
TLSO brace and aircast boot on the right foot.  Mobility was
definitely a problem and she was evaluated by the Physical
Therapy service who recommended acute rehab for mobility and
ther-ex ROM.

From a medical standpoint she remained free of any pulmonary
complications and was able to use her incentive spirometer
effectively. She was tolerating a regular diet though in modest
amounts and was voiding sufficiently.

Her orthopedic injuries will be followed closely and at some
point will need her calcaneous fracture surgically repaired.
She will also need close follow up with Cognitive neurology due
to her TBI.  After recovering from this serious accident she
will be transitioned to rehab today for further acute therapy in
preparation for her return home.

pulmonary edema and
small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with hypervolemia.
3.  Slightly distended colon, nonspecific and similar compared
[**2183-10-9**].

[**2183-10-14**] KUB
Final Report
HISTORY:  53-year-old man with history of multiple sclerosis,
neurogenic
bladder, lower GI bleed presents with worsening abdominal
distention and
nausea.

COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis, [**2183-10-11**]; CT abdomen
and pelvis, [**2183-10-9**].

FINDINGS:

Again seen are diffusely dilated loops of large bowel with air
fluid levels
with a maximal diameter of 8.5 cm. There is no clear evidence of

pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.  Multiple surgical clips are
seen in the left
lower quadrant.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple severely dilated loops of large bowel with air-fluid
levels unchanged
from prior examination.

[**2183-10-11**] CT Abdomen
IMPRESSION:

1.  Fluid-filled diffusely distended colon, unchanged from prior
examination.


2.  No active extravasation of contrast in the bowel lumen to
suggest source
for new brisk lower GI bleed.

3.  Ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung bases have
increased on the
left.  Though non-specific in appearance, findings could be
related to
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.


[**10-10**] Cystogram
FINDINGS:  Intravenous contrast fills the bladder without
evidence of leak.
No contrast is seen within the rectum.  Contrast is seen in the
right seminal
vesicle, possibly secondary to retrograde flow.  The fat plane
between the
bladder and rectum is obscured.  A Foley catheter is seen within
the bladder.
The bladder wall is trabeculated, likely secondary to neurogenic
bladder.  Air
layering anteriorly within the bladder is likely due to
instrumentation.
Residual enteric contrast is seen within the cecum.  Visualized
portion of the
colon is distended with air, as seen yesterday.  Evaluation of
intrapelvic
organs is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.

IMPRESSION:  No definitive colovesicular fistula detected on
this study.
Contrast seen in the right seminal vesicle, of indeterminate
etiology,
possibly secondary to retrograde flow.


[**2183-10-9**] CT abdomen
FINDINGS:  There is an enlarging right-sided pleural effusion as
well as a small left pleural effusion.  The right lung base
demonstrates patchy
ground-glass opacity.

A lack of contrast administration limits adequate assessment of
the solid
viscera.  The liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.  The
kidneys, adrenals,
spleen, pancreas are unremarkable.  The gallbladder and biliary
tree are
nondistended.

The small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel contains a
significant
amount of air. The rectosigmoid demonstrates mural thickening
and contains a large amount of fecal material.

PELVIS:
The bladder is not well distended and contains a Foley catheter.
Air is noted within the bladder.  There are calcifications noted
at the posterior aspect of the bladder, likely calculi.  No
definite colovesicular fistula is appreciated; however, this
would be difficult to exclude.

Skin staples are noted within the left inguinal region likely
related to a previous hernia repair.

BONES: There are no ominous bony abnormalities. There is
electrical hardware
in the left lower quadrant with wires extending up into the
spinal canal,
related to a spinal stimulator.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Thick-walled rectum and distal sigmoid compatible with
proctitis.
2.  The bladder contains multiple calculi. There is air in the
bladder,
secondary to the foley.  A colovesicular fistula is not
excluded.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions and new right lower lobe
airspace ground-glass
opacity concerning for pneumonia.


[**2183-10-8**] Renal U/S

FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10.6 cm and the left kidney
measures 10.9
cm.  There is no hydronephrosis.  No stone or concerning solid
renal mass is
visualized.  No perinephric fluid collection is identified.  A
tiny cyst is
seen at the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.4 cm.  The
bladder is collapsed on a Foley catheter.  A scant trace of
ascites is seen in
the pelvis.

IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable appearance of the kidneys with no
findings to
indicate an abscess.  A scant trace of ascites is noted in the
pelvis, of
unknown etiology.  A tiny simple right renal cyst is noted.
- CXR ([**2183-10-6**]): IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.

MICRO:

- C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2183-10-7**]):
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay.

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2183-10-15**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old male with MS, neurogenic bladder (Foley-dependent),
multiple recent admissions for UTIs presented with weakness,
diarrhea, and hematuria found to have urosepsis, course
complicated by lower GI bleed and hospital acquired pneumonia.

MICU COURSE:  Empirically started on cefepime and vancomycin.
The patient was fluid resuscitated with approximately 9 L of IVF
with improvement in his hemodynamics and WBC count.  C. diff
negative.  Transferred to medicine floor, hemodynamically stable
and afebrile. Found to have proctitis on CT abdomen/pelvis and
had lower GIB. Sent back to MICU.MICU Course: continued vanc and
cefepime and given 2u blood.  Transferred back to Medicine to
complete vanc/cefepime course, ending on [**2183-10-20**].

#) GI BLEED/Acute blood loss anemia: Prior to and during this
admission, he had been having non-bloody diarrhea x6 days which
required a flexiseal placement while he was in the unit. C diff
PCR was negative. A CT abdomen pelvis demonstrated proctitis on
[**2183-10-9**]. Upon arrival to the unit, he is no longer having bright
red blood per rectum, he is talkative/conversant with BP
preserved 130s/80s, but persistent tachycardia. NG tube was
placed and he was given bowel prep via the tube. His bleeding
stopped and it was felt that this prep was curative for the
bleed. He remained hemodynamically stable, and was called out to
the normal medical floor with plan for colonoscopy at a later
date. At midnight of [**10-11**] the patient had an episode of BRPPR,
and was tachycardic to 120s, although with stable blood
pressure, and was admitted back to the MICU. Hct at that time
was 29.7 (baseline appears to be ~33-39). He was transfused 2
units w/ post transfusion Hct of 29.1 although subsequent
hematocrits were stable. NG lavage did not reveal any blood. The
patient was seen by GI in the unit, with plan for colonoscopy,
however after the Movi prep the patient had no subsequent
episodes of BRBPR or bloody stools. This, combined with the fact
that the patient declined colonoscopy resulted in the decision
to transfer the patient back to the general medicine floor on
[**2183-10-12**]. Patient transfused a 3rd unit of pRBCs on the medicine
floor and hct remained stable at 28 and hematocrits were then
checked daily instead of [**Hospital1 **]. As GI bleed was likely lower, IV
Protonix was discontinued. Heparin SC and aspirin were held
initially while patient with labile hct and guaiac positive
stool. Hct at time of discharge was 27.9. Patient was discharged
with instructions to schedule outpatient colonoscopy for both
screening and diagnostic purposes.

#) SEPSIS DUE TO CATHETER-ASSOCIATED UTI: The patient has had
recent admissions for UTIs with ESBL, E.coli, VSE, and
Pseudomonas, and as such the decision was made to cover broadly
with vancomycin and cefepime until urine culture speciation and
sensitivity return. Patient initially presented with sepsis of
urinary origin, called out of MICU back to floor and course was
complicated by GIB and transferred back to MICU. ID followed
patient and recommended multiple imaging modalities and ruled
out enterovesicular fistula. Urine culture grew out Pseudomonas
and E. coli sensitive to cefepime and enterococcus sensitive to
vancomycin. Cefepime and vancomycin were continued for two week
course and ended on [**2183-10-20**] via PICC line as per ID recs. Upon
coming back to medicine floor, patient's leukocytosis eventually
resolved and remained afebrile. Patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(urology) and has been refusing clean intermittent
catheterization. Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
outpatient to discuss possible suprapubic cath placement. ID
consulted and did not recommend prophylactic antibiotics; ID
team recommended urine acidification with Vitamin C and
methenamine. Patient is to followup with ID in [**Hospital 4898**] clinic.

#Ileus: Patient found to have stool throughout bowel on CT and
stercoral ulcer was considered as cause of lower GI bleed.
Patient was passing very little stool upon returning to medical
floor from MICU s/p 3u RBCS and was having worsening abdominal
distention and patient was having nausea. KUB showed bowel
distention with gas and was then manually disimpacted and
started on daily suppositories which helped patient pass stool
regularly on daily basis. Given history of MS, patient was at
risk of constipation and will need chronic bowel regimen. At
time of discharge, patient was regularly passing BMs and had
benign abdominal exam.

#)Hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia: Patient found to be
hypoxic after lower GIB and required 2L of O2. Was symptomatic
feeling dyspneic. Imaging revealed new ground glass opacities
suggesting pneumonia. Patient was treated with vanc and cefepime
as above which resolved leukocytosis and hypoxia and dyspnea.
Vanc trough checked and found to be subtherapeutic and
uptitrated dose for trough of 15-20. Patient continued
antibiotics through PICC until [**2183-10-20**]. Patient is to followup
with ID in clinic.

#) TACHYCARDIA: Most likely differential was volume depletion.
Given persistence after 5L IVF repletion, considered other
etiologies such as supraventricular tachycardia, pulmonary
embolism, oxybutynin side effect, hypervolemia.  At the time of
transfer out of the MICU, he remained tachycardic into the
100-120s, although asymptomatic and without any other signs of
hemodynamic instability. As patient had persistent tachycardia
and hypoxia on medicine floor, CXR was done which was concerning
for possible cavitary lesions. CTA was done to rule out PE and
clarify infiltrates which did not show PE and confirmed
pneumonia (without cavitations). Pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema were found on imaging as well which was consistent with
hypervolemia. Pt received two doses of IV 10mg Lasix and had
copious urine output. Patient's hypoxia and tachycardia
improved. In addition, pt's oxybutynin was discontinued due to
anticholinergic effects which may have helped improve
tachycardia. HR at time of discharge ranged from 70s to low
100s.

#Malnutrition, severe: Patient with poor PO intake throughout
course and had dramatically worsened with development of HAP.
Albumin of 2.5. Patient made NPO with recent GI bleed and with
ileus requiring disimpaction. Following resolving ileus, patient
was encouraged to improve PO intake and nutrition was consulted.
Patient refused TID Ensure Plus supplementation as it caused
diarrhea historically. At time of discharge patient was taking
in better PO, tolerating solids well and was no longer
complaining of dry mouth. He was discharged with phosphorus
supplementation.

#) ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Cr 1.2 on admission up from baseline of
0.5-0.6.  Received 5L NS in ED as well as fluid resuscitation
while in the MICU. On the medicine floor, patient received IVF
maintenance while being treated for HAP and had decreased
appetite. At the time of discharge his creatinine had resolved
to 0.3.

#) ACUTE, COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED DIARRHEA: Differential was broad,
although most acute diarrheas are caused by viruses.  Recent
antibiotics and chronic prophylactic antibiotics raised
suspicion for clostridium difficile colitis which was negative x
2 separate tests during admission.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
================
#) MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE: Followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] in neurology, complicated by ileus and neurogenic
bladder.  Gets methylprednisolone 1000mg injections 3 days
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Oxybutynin (given originally for bladder spasms) was
discontinued as patient was complaining of dry mouth and had
persistent tachycardia.

#) DEPRESSION: Continue fluoxetine.
#) OSTEOPOROSIS: Continue calcium and vitamin D.
#) DYSLIPIDEMIA: Continue ezetimibe.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 80287**],
You were admitted to the hospital for a severe infection which
was from a urinary tract infection. You were given large amounts
of IV fluids in the ICU and you improved with IV antibiotics
cefepime and vancomycin. You completed a 14 day course of
antibiotics for your urinary tract infection and pneumonia. You
will need to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (urology) as an outpatient to
discuss placing a suprapubic catheter. We stopped your
oxybutynin since it was of little benefit and was likely the
cause of your fast heart rate and dry mouth. Also, please
followup with infectious disease as outpatient on Monday
[**10-27**] since they followed in treating your urine
infection and pneumonia.
You also had a gastrointestinal bleed which resolved on its own.
You refused to have a colonoscopy done to evaluate what exactly
caused the bleeding but we strongly encourage you to have a
colonoscopy done as an outpatient for colon cancer screening and
to further investigate any abnormalities which could have caused
your bleeding. Your blood counts were stable after receiving
blood transfusions.
We also encourage you to continue taking bowel regimen
medications to prevent constipation which was another issue
while hospitalized. Constipation can lead to decreased appetite,
abdominal pain and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
Please followup with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to
continue to follow your anemia and electrolytes.
Continue to stay hydrated by drinking at least 8 glasses of
water per day.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y M with MS c/b recurrent UTI who presents from ED with
fevers, lethargy and transient hypotension.
.
# Hypotension - In setting of dehydration and likely
SIRS/sepsis. Responded well to IVF in ED.  Pt was admitted to
MICU for monitoring.  Lisinopril was initially held and then
restarted once hypotension resolved.
.
# UTI:  As like previous admissions found to have recurrence of
UTI with WBC of 30 on admission. Broad spectrum ABx with
vancomycin and cefepime were initiated until the urine cx was
avaiable. Suprapubic cath changed.  WBC trended down to 5.8
while on abx.  Urine cultures grew pseudomonas and citrobacter
both sensitive to meropenem.  PICC placed [**12-1**] for home IV
treatment.  Pt to be discharged home on meropenem to complete a
7 day course.  Pt to follow up with primary care physician to
assess for culture negativity at end of treatment course. Pt
also to follow up with Urology for further investigation of
recurrent UTIs, and pathogens consistent with possible fecal
contamination (ie rule out enterovesicular fistula). Also
discussed catheter care with mother who provides all catheter
care.  States that care is very clean and meticulous.  Suggest
placement of gauze over catheter during day to prevent possible
external contamination by patient.
.
# Upper extremity swelling: Noted after placement of PICC.
UENIS performed and negative for clot.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: c/b constipation and decreased respiratory
drive. Currently at baseline but some longterm progression. As
per outpt -> BiPAP at 16 of IPAP and 12 of EPAP nightly and for
four to six hours during the day was continued. Outpt MS meds
were continued.
.
# MS change: resolved with IVF and antibiotics.
.
# FEN: pt had agressive IVF initially, then restarted regular
diet, which he tolerated well. Hyponantremia returned to
baseline after IVF.

# Diarrhea: resolved.  C. diff negative.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from surgery (s/p total abdominal colectomy with end
ileostomy, aspiration PNA, UTI)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Total colectomy with end ileostomy
Nasogastric tube
Peripherally inserted central catheter


History of Present Illness:
50M h/o MS, hemiplegia, bowel and bladder incontinence,
suprapubic catheter with recurrent UTIs, restrictive lung
disease [**3-6**] muscle weakness admitted for elective colectomy for
chronic constipation. Admitted to surgery for pre-op bowel prep
(apparently required 2 weeks). The patient underwent surgery on
[**2-23**] without complications. On POD#3 ([**2-27**]), the patient
developed respiratory distress and found with copious secretions
and vomit on gown, found to have new right-sided infiltrate
thought to be [**3-6**] aspiration event. He was transferred to the
ICU where he was started on vanco/zosyn, respiratory status
stabilized, and transferred back to the floor. He has continued
to spike fevers since this time as high as 102. Blood cultures
have been negative, but urine grew pseudomonas resistant to
quinolones, sensitive to zosyn. Patient has been NPO with TPN
given aspiration. Transfered to medicine for further management.
.
Currently, the patient has no complaints. Denies N/V/abdominal
pain/SOB. Unsure why he has not been eating, other than ""I have
not been given anything"". Feels hungry.

.
Abdominal X-Ray [**2-16**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern
.
Abdominal X-Ray [**2-19**]:
1. Bowel gas pattern most consistent with adynamic ileus,
although proximal small bowel loops are increasingly dilated.
Early or partial SBO cannot be excluded. Follow-up radiographs
are recommended, and if there is high clinical concern for SBO,
CT.
2. Decreased fecal loading within the colon.
.
CTA [**2-27**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse airspace opacities and consolidations along the right
lung, greater than left, most suggestive of pneumonia.
3. Tiny peripherally based left pneumothorax. Small right
pleural effusion.
4. Moderate amount of free fluid seen within the abdomen.
Moderately distended loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels
also noted.
.
Chest X-Ray [**2-27**]: Patchy consolidations in right upper and lower
lobes likely representing aspiration. Multifocal pneumonia is
also a less likely consideration. [**3-1**]: Improving aeration of
the right-sided airspace process.
.
Gastric emptying study [**3-3**]:
Following the oral ingestion of a meal of radiolabeled
egg-whites, the patient was placed supine beneath the gamma
camera. Continuous anterior and posterior images of the tracer
activity in the stomach and bowel were recorded for 60 minutes.
Delayed anterior and posterior images were obtained at 2.5 and 4
hours. Region of interest analysis of the tracer activity in the
stomach shows 97% residual activity in the stomach at 1 hour,
80% at 2.5 hours, and 82% at 4 hours. No gastroesophageal reflux
is observed during the study. IMPRESSION:  Severely delayed
gastric emptying with about 80% residual activity at 4 hours.
.
SUPINE ABDOMEN, TWO VIEWS ([**3-4**]):  Surgical skin staples project
over the mid abdomen.  There are multiple dilated air-filled
loops of small bowel in the mid-upper abdomen, measuring up to 5
cm, concerning for small bowel
obstruction. The stomach is moderately distended with air.  No
free
intraperitoneal air is seen on this single supine view.  No
pneumatosis is
identified.  IMPRESSION:  Persistent dilated loops of small
bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction.  A CT of the
abdomen is recommended for further characterization of this
finding.
.
RUQ U/S ([**3-9**]):
FINDINGS:  The pancreas is visualized in the midline and is
unremarkable.  The liver is slightly coarse in echotexture but
no focal liver lesion is
identified.  No evidence of any intrahepatic bile duct
dilatation.  The
gallbladder is somewhat obscured by overlying gas but no
evidence of any
cholelithiasis.  The CBD is not dilated.  The portal vein is
patent with
normal centripetal flow. IMPRESSION:  Limited ultrasound of the
gallbladder and liver reveals no focal abnormalities.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast ([**3-10**]):
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The hepatic dome is partly
excluded.
There is minor bibasilar atelectasis, without effusions.
Otherwise, the
visualized lung bases are clear.  There is a 4 mm
hypoattenuating focus in the hepatic dome, within segment VIII,
which is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder is not
distended.  The fundus shows slight prominence of the wall,
perhaps related to adenomyomatosis.  There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  No calcified stones
are visualized in the gallbladder.  The pancreas appears normal.
There is fluid in the paracolic gutters and thickening of the
anterior pararenal fascia bilaterally.  This appearance can be
seen in pancreatitis but in this context is more likely related
to a post-operative change.  Similarly there is a small amount
of ascites, which is also presumably post-operative. There is no
free air.  The adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable. The
stomach appears normal.  The patient is status post total
colectomy with an ileostomy present within the right lower
quadrant.  Contrast has not passed fully to the ileostomy, but
has progressed through most of the small bowel at the time of
scanning.  Along the course of the small bowel, there are
intermittent areas of focal mild dilatation, with the overall
appearance more suggestive of a mild ileus than obstruction.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A suprapubic tube is
unchanged. The
prostate and seminal vesicles are within normal limits. There is
post-
operative rectal stump containing a tiny residual amount of air
and some
fluid. There is no lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS:  There is marked osteopenia.  There are multiple
hemangiomas
within the thoracolumbar spine, with an unchanged appearance.
There are mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, not
significantly changed.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post total colectomy with ileostomy.
2.  Intermittent focal segments of mild dilatation of the small
bowel without evidence of obstruction.  The appearance is more
suggestive of a mild ileus.
3.  No CT evidence of peripancreatic inflammation.
4.  Post-operative changes including a small amount of ascites.
.
KUB ([**3-22**]): There are several prominent dilated loops of small
bowel within the mid abdomen.  Study is limited due to patient's
size and difficulty in positioning the patient.  The lower
pelvis is not included on the study. Nonetheless, these dilated
small bowel loops are concerning for small-bowel obstruction or
ileus.  Followup to resolution or cross-sectional imaging is
recommended if there is persists symptoms.
.
RUQ U/S ([**3-22**]): Unremarkable limited ultrasound of the liver,
gallbladder, pancreas.

Brief Hospital Course:
50M h/o severe MS c/b paraplegia, chronic constipation,
restrictive lung disease, frequent UTIs initially presented for
elective total colectomy with end ileostomy; course complicated
by aspiration PNA, SBO, and prolonged ileus.
.
# GI dysmotility: Initially presented for elective total
abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy due to chronic colonic
inertia which was performed [**2-23**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] after aggressive
bowel clean out. Post-op gastric emptying study with severe
delayed emptying (>80%). He was made NPO and started on TPN.
Increased abdominal distention, vomiting developed on [**2178-3-7**] and
KUB revealed SBO, likely partial given continued ostomy output,
due to MS and post-op/bowel manipulation. An NG tube was placed
for gastric decompression. [**2178-3-9**] CT abdomen showed ileus, with
resolution of SBO. Also with LFT/pancreatic enzyme lab
abnormalities (elevated amylase, lipase, transaminases) possibly
related to obstruction that then resolved. Normal calcium,
triglycerides. Initial concern for pancreatitis but there was no
evidence of stones or pancreatic inflammation on RUQ ultrasound
or abdominal CT. No source of internal or external obstruction
was observed on CT scan. GI was consulted and recommended
erythryomycin and reglan to promote GI motility. EGD was
considered but decided to be low yield given CT scan findings.
The NG tube was removed [**2178-3-19**] as residuals remained <50cc and
a PO trial was initiated. Initially the patient tolerated clears
with increasing ostomy output but then became more distended
with KUB evidence of evolving SBO. He was made NPO and TPN
continued. The patient continues to have reasonable ostomy
output. A family discussion was held given the prolonged status
of his ileus and the family decided that they would like to take
the patient home. PICC line was changed on [**3-27**] and the patient
was discharged to home with TPN. He will followup with PCP for
initiation of PO trial in the future vs. indwelling line
placement for long-term TPN if he cannot tolerate POs. He was
also discharged home with erythromycin and reglan for gut
dysmotility.
.
# Aspiration PNA: Found by surgery team hypoxic with vomit on
gown. Started on vanc/zosyn and completed 7 day course. CTA
chest on [**2-27**] negative for PE. Continued to spike fevers despite
antibiotics to as high as 102F and ID team consulted who
believed this may be medication-related fever. Antibiotics were
discontinued and he remained afebrile throughout the rest of
hospital course with no respiratory distress and good oxygen
saturations. Also given flagyl x 3 days for possible C. diff,
which was then discontinued when toxin was negative. WBC
initially elevated but slowly normalized.
.
# UTI: The patient has a suprapubic foley chronically, changed
q30 days. Urine culture [**3-1**] grew pseudomonas resistant to
cipro, sensative to zosyn and he was given a 7 day course of
zosyn. Throughout the hospital course, a very slight mucous
discharge around suprapub catheter site was observed but without
other signs of local or systemic infeciton present. Repeat UTI
[**3-23**] again grew pseudomonas >100K, likely representing
colonization and no treatment was given as he was afebrile
without leukocytosis. Suprapubic cath was changed on [**2178-2-17**] and
[**2178-3-23**] with 3 days peri-change cipro per his home protocol.
.
# Thrombocytosis: Most likely reactive thrombocytosis [**3-6**] recent
surgery and pneumonia. Discussed with heme who agrees clearly
reactive process and very low risk of spontaneous thrombus. Was
on lovenox already for post-op prophylaxis. Platelet count
peaked at 950-1000k, but normalized prior to discharge.
.
# MS: Continued neurontin and weekly MTX after resolution of
SBO. Held baclofen given concern for contribution to bowel
obstruction, but restarted at discharge for symptomatic relief
per family's request. Baclofen issue will be readressed with his
primary care physician.
.
# HTN: The patient remained normotensive off BP meds with SBP
max 140's. We are holding on his blood pressure medications as
his blood pressure was normal. This should be readressed by his
primary care physician.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic. Hemolysis labs negative. Iron studies c/w
ACD. Appears chronic with baseline mid-30's. Stable throughout
hospitalization in high 20's. Most likely etiology of acute
decline is post-op blood loss, complicated by recent infection
and chronic medical illness.
.
# Restrictive lung disease: [**3-6**] respiratory muscle weakness from
MS on home BiPAP. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Continued on CPAP per
Respiratory (12, 3L O2).
.
# Psych: Noted to have flat affect, which per family & PCP was
unusual for the patient. His mood appeared to correlate directly
with medical acuity. Concern for depression in setting of
chronic medical illness, and therefore consulted psych for
evaluation who did not believe he was depressed but rather
perhaps decreased energy from withdrawal of provigil during SBO.
Provigil was restarted with slight improvement, and then he was
given a trial of ritalin with enhancement of his mood and energy
level. Ritalin was discontinued prior to discharge and provigil
restarted at home dose per psych recs.
.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tach intermittently likely appropriate [**3-6**]
infection and deconditioning, eventually resolved. Monitored on
telemetry with no events.
.
# h/o hyponatremia: Sodium remained normal. No acute issues,
monitored daily.
.
# Nutrition: Home TPN via PICC line (changed [**2178-3-27**]), NPO
except medications. Plan for PO trial as outpatient. The patient
passed bedside speech and swallow evaluation. PEG tube was
discussed but both the patient and family declined, and utility
likely poor given likely etiology of GI dysmotility.

Chief Complaint:
Low urine output

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 year-old M w/ a h/o MS, quadraparesis, HTN,
[**First Name3 (LF) 12382**] lung disease, chronic constipation and SBOs s/p
ileostomy, multiple UTIs (also s/p suprapubic tube) presents
with SBO and UTI.  Of note he was just recently discharged from
the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-28**] for an admission for a UTI (negative cultures)
treated with cipro, shingles treated w/ acyclovir and SBO
evaluated by surgery but managed conservatively.  He returns
today as his home health aide had noticed his decreased urine
output, 75cc overnight when he usually has about 1 liter
overnight.  His ostomy output has been high. The patient himself
was not sure if he has had a change in his ostomy output or
suprapubic output.
.
Over the past two weeks he has had mild earaches, a sorethroat
as well as some rhinorrhea.  He has not noticed any watery /
itchy eyes, any visual changes, or  any new neurologic symptoms.
He denies any abdominal pain and has not subjectively noticed
any change in abdominal distention.  He denies any pain in
regards to his zoster (now or when diagnosed).  Denies CP, has
an occasional cough that is not worsening. Of note, his sister
reports he does not report pain  unless it is extreme.
.
In the ED, he was noted to be severely dehydrated on exam.   His
BP nadir was 79/43 and HR peak was 97.  T 99 (he usually ""runs
low""), new ARF 1.4 up from 0.6.  Rec'd levo / flagyl / vanc.
Seen by Surgery who state the SBO is not high grade and he is
losing fluid from ileostomy.  NGT placed.  Rec'd 6L of fluids.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Partial small bowel obstruction: Within past 6 months he has
had several admits with partial obstruction. Presented with
considerable ileostomy output and hypotension. KUB and CT
abdomen consistent with partial obstruction. Surgery was
consulted and felt either partial SBO or unchanged from prior
admission given the amount of ostomy output. Recommended to
watch for cessation of output or signs of peritonitis, as these
would be indications of worsening and surgery would be
considered. At that time, there was no indication for surgery.
An NG tube was placed for gut decompression, and the patient was
kept NPO and given IVF. We attempted to match ostomy output with
IV fluids. Per Surgery recommendations, we consulted GI to
consider placement of G tube, given the frequency of these
episodes. Consideration was given to opening this tube for
decompression if he becomes obstructed again. He was evaluated
by GI on [**2180-11-1**], and they felt that G tube would not be
appropriate in the setting of an acute partial obstruction, and
we would re-address if this is something the family would want
in the future. If so, they recommended that IR may be more
appropriate for placement given his aspiration risks.
.
The possibility of undiagnosed Crohn's disease accounting for
distal small bowel strictures, which in turn have been
contributing to SBOs, was raised and discussed at length. If
confirmed, GI would recommend a trial of empiric steroids. The
GI team also contact[**Name (NI) **] Pathology to re-cut tissue from frozen
sections of colon, resected during prior surgeries, to look for
evidence of IBD. Of significant concern was that  if Mr. [**Known lastname 26173**]
does have Crohn's, starting him on steroids would be
challenging.  The risks could outweigh the benefits, and it
would be unlikely that steroids would reverse the small bowel
strictures already present. In addition, we would need to
involve his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**], and his neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 95158**],
in the discussion. We    would also need to readdress his
overall goals of care, as his family has been considering
hospice care.
.
Given his prolonged NPO status, he was started on TPN. Mr.
[**Known lastname 95159**] obstruction gradually improved with NGT to suction, and
it was clamped on [**2179-11-8**].  His ostomy output increased and it
was decided to proceed with small bowel MR enterography to look
for evidence of bowel wall inflammation or strictures to support
the diagnosis of possible IBD.  There was no evidence of this.
We concluded his recurrent SBOs are most likely secondary to
worsening multiple sclerosis. He continued to improve
clinically, and his NGT was removed on [**11-11**]. The following day
he had a swallowing evalution, which showed no evidence of
aspiration, and he was started on a regular diet. His family was
eager to take him home to gradually advance his diet there. TPN
was discontinued.
.
# UTI: No fevers on admission but he had leukocytosis and
hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia, as well as elevated
lactate. Prior pathogens have included Pseudomonas, with a MIC
of 9 for cefepime and zosyn, and MRSA. He was initially
empirically started on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Urine culture
grew few gram negatives (likely contaminant) and yeast. As his
leukocytosis and hypotension improved, and given the above urine
culture, ceftazidime was discontinued.
.
# Hypotension: This was attributed to hypovolemic shock, and
initially also possibly due to sepsis. This improved with IVF
resuscitation. In addition, given his initial hyponatremia and
hyperkalemia, a.m. cortisol was checked and found to be normal.
.
# Acute renal failure: On admission. FeNa 0.6% indicating likely
prerenal etiology. Resolved with administration of IVF.
.
# OSA: Desatting to 60s without BiPap. Needs to be on BiPap at
night. Has machine at home.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit 27.8 on [**2179-11-2**], down from 33.4 at
admission. Was likely hemoconcentrated on admission given
dehydration. No evidence of acute blood loss. Hematocrit was
monitored daily, and he was maintained on his daily folic acid.
.
# Hypertension: Restarted on lisinopril per home regimen on
[**2179-11-2**].  Dose titrated up to 10 mg/day on [**11-10**] as patient was
persistently hypertensive.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: Methotrexate weekly given IM.  Dose
confirmed with Neurologist.
.
#Goals of care: Patient lives with his supportive family, with
his mother as his primary caretaker along with his sister who
lives nearby.  They are very devoted to him and recognize that
his disease is quite advanced.  Discussions were held between
the patient's mother and sister and the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
who also spoke with the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**].  They wish
to take Mr. [**Known lastname 26173**] home as soon as possible. They have a hospice
program that is ready to accept him into their care when they
are ready and know how to activate this benefit when they feel
it is time.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
Left PICC terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. Lung
volumes are low, there is continued left lower lobe opacity with
partial silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, corresponding to
atelectasis on prior CT. Small left pleural effusion is also
present. The right lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Old
healed right anterior second through fourth rib deformities.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and small
effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


CTA ABD & PELVIS:
FINDINGS: There has been slight increase in moderate left and
small right
simple pleural effusions, with associated compressive
atelectasis. The heart is normal in size, with physiologic
pericardial fluid.

ABDOMEN: There has been interval decrease in moderate ascites
post-paracentesis. Subcutaneous gas is noted in the right lower
quadrant at the site of paracentesis access, and tracks along
the preperitoneal space.

Moderate ascites is present throughout the abdomen. There is
diffuse omental caking, with lobulated enhancing masses encasing
the entire upper peritoneum, particularly . Soft tissue implants
are also noted along the right hepatic lobe extending into
[**Location (un) 6813**] pouch and along the right kidney and paracolic
gutter, right anterior omentum, periportal space tracking along
the falciform ligament, gastrohepatic ligament, and splenic
hilum tracking inferiorly along the left paracolic gutter. There
is centralization of bowel loops and viscera, compatible with
malignant ascites.

The liver enhances homogeneously, without focal lesions.
Gallbladder is
partially collapsed, with mild wall edema secondary to third
spacing. The
pancreas is atrophic, but enhances normally. There is no intra-
or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. Spleen is normal in size.


The adrenals are normal. The kidneys are atrophic, with cortical
thinning and lobulation suggesting prior ischemic or infectious
injury, as well as multiple dystrophic calcifications. Moderate
hydronephrosis and proximal hydroureter persists, tapering
gradually into the pelvis without evidence of obstructing
stones.

The stomach is normal. Mild wall edema is noted in the first and
second
portions of the duodenum, likely due to third spacing. The
distal small bowel is unremarkable.

PELVIS: Again seen is a large pelvic mass measuring 14.7 cm AP x
12.7 cm TV x 12.5 cm SI. This is a markedly heterogeneous
appearance with irregular enhancement due to mixed solid and
cystic components, internal septations, and coarse internal
calcification.

The cecum is anteriorly folded. A 1-cm pedunculated lesion along
the medial wall of the ascending colon (600B:33) may represent
an epiploic appendage. Mild wall edema is noted in the hepatic
flexure, likely due to third spacing.
Transverse and descending colon are unremarkable. The proximal
sigmoid colon is encased within the pelvic mass and collapsed.
However, there is partial reconstitution of the mid-sigmoid, as
well as a patulous rectum with intact oral contrast passage,
excluding physiologic obstruction.

The uterus is contained within the right inferior aspect of the
mass, and
appears distorted, with retained fluid in the endometrial canal.
The bladder and distal ureters are compressed inferiorly. A
Foley catheter is present, with balloon inflated at the bladder
dome, and tip kinking the bladder anterosuperiorly.

There is mild lumbar dextroscoliosis, with multilevel
degenerative changes. Transitional lumbosacral anatomy is noted
at L5-S1 on the left. Unchanged L2 compression fracture
demonstrates 50% loss of anterior height. Bilateral pars defects
are noted at L4-L5, with grade [**2-11**] anterolisthesis and near
complete loss of disc space. There is minimal retrolisthesis at
L5-S1. Marked deformity of the sacrum, which is deviated to the
left, with apparent post-traumatic deformity at S1-S2. Pelvic
girdle is also dystrophic. Old healed fractures of the bilateral
inferior pubic rami.

There has been interval development of a 7.1 cm TV x 5 cm AP x
9.2 cm SI
intramuscular hematoma in the left paraspinal muscle, spanning
the L1 through L4 levels. This demonstrates mixed hyper- and
hypodense components, compatible with acute-on-subacute
hemorrhage. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal extension.

Diffuse anasarca is present.

CT ARTERIOGRAM: There is no evidence of active arterial
extravasation. Note is made of superior compression and kinking
of the celiac artery by an anomalous diaphragmatic crus,
suggestive of median arcuate ligament syndrome in the correct
clinical setting. Superior/inferior mesenteric artery origins
are widely patent. Note is made of aberrant origin of the
splenic artery from the superior mesenteric artery.

CT VENOGRAM: There is no evidence of venous extravasation. The
portal,
splenic, superior and inferior mesenteric, and hepatic veins are
widely
patent. Retrievable IVC filter is present, with tip at the level
of the renal artery takeoffs. Again noted is near-occlusive
thrombus involving the distal right common and proximal right
external iliac veins. Left common femoral and superficial
femoral venous clots have at least partially resolved.

IMPRESSION:
1. New left paraspinal hematoma, without active extravasation.
2. Decrease in malignant ascites post-paracentesis.
3. Diffuse metastatic omental caking and peritoneal seeding.
4. Large pelvic mass, with distal ureteral obstruction and
encasement of the sigmoid colon and uterus.
5. Deep venous thrombosis, with IVC filter in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with recent
discharge for UTI, altered mental status, bilateral DVT's on
lovenox, and new diagnosis of ovarian cancer, who presents with
tachycardia, 5 point hematocrit drop, guaiac positive stools,
and recent paracentesis complicated with bleeding.

# Anemia: On [**Known lastname **] hct 22.3, down from 27 on discharge on
[**2109-2-18**]. On lovenox for DVTs, so has increased risk of bleeding.
Likely primarily due to new left paraspinal muscle hematoma seen
on CT (7.1 cm TV x 5 cm AP x 9.2 cm SI, spanning the L1 through
L4 levels). GI was consulted - felt that the acute blood loss
was more likely related to paraspinal hematoma rather than GI
bleed. Nonetheless, EGD was considered, but patient declined.

# Tachycardia: She was also tachycardic during last [**Date Range **],
attributed at that time to hypermetabolic state and metoprolol
was uptitrated from XL 75mg daily to 37.5mg TID. [**Month (only) 116**] also be due
worsened by acute blood loss (see above) and DVT. Restarted
metoprolol at slightly lower dose (25mg TID) to avoid rebound
tachycardia. Her HR decreased with blood transfusion and IV
fluids to 90s-100s. Metoprolol was held briefly for concern of
further GI bleeding, however HR increased to 120s without
further evidence of bleeding so metoprolol was restarted at 25mg
TID just prior to trasnfer to medicine floor. HR improved since
adding metoprolol. Later, she was unable to take po metoprolol,
so this was switched to iv metoprolol, initially 2.5 mg iv q6h,
then up to 7.5 mg iv q6h.

# DVT: She has an IVC filter placed and has been on Lovenox
since her last [**Month (only) **]. We held her lovenox on [**Month (only) **],
given concern for acute bleed. Heparin ggt held in ICU given
concern for bleed. V/Q scan from recent [**Month (only) **] here showed
low probability for PE. Restarted iv heparin when Hct
stabilized. Switched to Lovenox 50 mg sc bid on [**2-25**] (she had
been on 60 mg sc bid at the time of last discharge). Increased
to 60 mg sc bid when Hct remained stable.

# UTI: Multiple previous UTI's due to chronic indwelling foley.
Last hospitalization several days prior to [**Month/Year (2) **] showed
urine culture of ampicillin sensitive enterococcus. ?Reportedly
needs lifelong Ampicillin prophylaxis, so she was continued on
this on [**Month/Year (2) **]. Urine cultures here grew ~5000 yeast. Two
week course of ampicillin was completed on [**2-24**].
.
# Ovarian Cancer, probable: Large pelvic mass visualized again.
She was seen by Atrius Oncology here.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: Not on medications currently. On provigil
and baclofen at
home. Restarted modafenil.
.
# Encephalopathy: Her baseline is A&Ox3 and able to engage in
conversation, though occasionally confused. Was somewhat
encephalopathic on her last [**Month/Year (2) **] as well, however this
improved upon treatment of her UTI. Has had extensive work up
recently at [**Hospital3 **] (LP, MRI brain, etc) that did not reveal
any significant abnormalities. According to her brother, her
mental status has waxed and waned considerably in the last few
weeks. The weekend of [**2-23**]-15, she became more encephalopathic
- she was awake and responded to questions, but in a nonsensical
manner, repeating syllables, and unable to state her full name,
though she did follow some instructions.

#END OF LIFE CARE:
Over the last few days of her hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] had
persistent encephalopathy, and became less interactive.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing.  There was no clear
reversible cause of her encephalopathy. She was unable to take
her po meds, and her po intake of food was quite limited. She
had anasarca. TPN was initiated. Neurology was consulted - they
thought that her encephalopathy was most likely toxic-metabolic,
though paraneoplastic encephalopathy or non-convulsive seizures
could also be playing a role.  Lumbar puncture was not done, as
she had had a complication (hematoma) from an LP during a
previous hospitalization, and findings of LP were very unlikely
to change management. Bedside EEG was done -showed generalized
encephalopathy, but no seizure activity. Oncology, Palliative
Care, and Neurology joined in meetings with the patient's
brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1007**]. Given the extent of her cancer and her
poor functional status, she was not a candidate for surgery nor
for chemotherapy. In a meeting on [**2-28**], given Ms. [**Known lastname **]
declining status, new signs of discomfort (groaning, poor
responsiveness), no identifiable reversible cause of
encephalopathy, and overall disease burden, it was decided (with
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 1007**] and multidisciplinary team) to shift to
comfort-focused care. She expired on [**2109-3-1**] at 4:12pm. Her
brother, [**Name (NI) **], was present.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year-old male with multiple sclerosis,
peripheral vascular disease, BL LE ulcers transferred from
[**Last Name (un) 1188**] house with leukocytosis and vomiting for several days.
He denied pain, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain,
dysuria. He had been intermittently feeling nauseated with 2
episodes of vomiting in the two days prior to admission.
Unknown last bowel movement prior to admission.
.
ED course: He was initially afebrile on presentation, and then
spiked to 102.6.  His BP was also stable at first.  He had a
distended though benign abdominal exam.  During his ED course,
he developed more abdominal distension and a CT abd / pelvis was
done which showed a partial SBO and likely bibasilar
infiltrates.  His BP was trending down.  He received 4 liters of
lactated ringers.  He was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin
and flagyl.  He had a central line placed.  A nasogastric tube
was placed with large output after which time he felt better.

Studies~
.
CT Abd: 1.  Patchy bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with probable
small adjacent pleural effusions and small pericardial effusion.

2.  Dilated jejunum measuring 3-4 cm with air-fluid levels and
non-abrupt tapering transition point within the left lower
quadrant.  These findings are most suggestive of an early mild
partial small-bowel obstruction, although  atypical appearing
ileus is also within the differential.  Consider serial
radiographs to assess for change and contrast progression. 3.
Large fusiform infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a large amount of
intramural thrombus as described above.  Moderate
atherosclerotic disease involving the intrathoracic aorta and
its branches. 4.  Hypoattenuating hepatic lesion, too small to
definitively characterize. Left renal cyst.
.
CXR: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
.
Repeat CXR: 1. Appropriately-positioned left subclavian catheter
without evidence of pneumothorax on the supine film.
2.  Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia is better appreciated on
concomitantly performed abdominal CT examination.

PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.
The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**] performed the procedure.Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the Attending Radiologist, was present for the entire
procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a right double-lumen PICC line measuring 40 cm in
length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.
The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 40 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 male with history of MS (paraplegia), DM, MDS, chronic anemia
admitted for sepsis and [**Hospital 68385**] transferred to floor after
stabilization and transient pressor needs, then found to have
UGIB, transfer out of MICU after 8 units PRBC, stable on floor.
.
HYPOTENSION AND SEPSIS
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with a high fever from his nursing home,
and was found to be hypotensive in the ED. The sepsis protocol
was initiated, and he was admitted to the MICU. The differential
diagnosis remained pneumonia or as related to his
gastrointestintal tract, as he was found to have a partial small
bowel obstruction. Patient completed course of Levofloxacin and
Flagyl on [**12-5**]. THe patient had a transient rise in WBC without
clinical signs of infection which resolved after the central
line was removed.
.
SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION, PARTIAL
The patient received NGT placement, as well as decompression via
rectal tube. Surgery was consulted and followed the patient in
house. He was started on TPN, and then diet slowly advanced.
Rectal tube was pulled prior to discharge. TPN was discontinued
prior to discharge. THe patient should be encouraged to take po.
.
UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED
After sepsis was stabilized in the MICU, the patient was
transferred to the floor, where he was found to have an
increasing heart rate. Suction on the NG tube revealed bloody
return, and the patient was found to have a falling hematocrit.
He was transferred to the MICU for follow-up, and received 8
units of pRBCs while there. After conversation with HCP, a
decision to pursue endoscopy to attempt to identify and stop
bleeding was made. EGD [**12-2**] showed marked friability of the
stomach mucosa with contact bleeding, multiple non-bleeding
ulcers were found in the stomach and a single bleeding ulcer was
found in the cardia near the GE junction s/p electrocautery for
hemostasis. Subsequently, he has been hemodynamically stable
with HR in 90s. Hematocrit remained stable for >96 hours prior
to discharge. He was discharged on Pantoprazole 40mg twice
daily.
.
HYPOXIA
Patient still on oxygen, currently 96% on 2 liters nasal
cannula. Combination of recovery from pneumonia and volume
overload from fluids given in ICU during GIB. Continue with
gentle diuresis and monitor electrolytes.
.
NUTRITION
Due to concern of aspiration patient was evaluated by speech and
swallow on [**12-6**], his diet was advanced to thin liquids and
ground consistency solids. He needs assistance with meals and
should have his pills whole with purees. TPN dicscontinued as
above and PICC line placed prior to discharge.
.
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM
Noted on CT scan was a 4.7 infrarenal AAA in the setting of
profound atherosclerotic disease. Maintain good BP control, will
need serial imaging as an outpatient.
.
DIABETES
Placed on regular insulin sliding scale.

PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH

Reason: PICc for antibiotics

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with sepsis and UTI, pneumonia and ulcers in
feet/osteomyelitis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
PICc for antibiotics
PICC LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics.

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was
performed.

RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7748**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**],
the attending radiologist, has reviewed the images.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the
right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing
intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
guidewire and a double-lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length
was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the
chest.

The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile
dressing applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
5 French double-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic
venous approach. Final internal length is 39 cm, with the tip
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL BILAT; ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) [**Last Name (un) **]

Reason: assess for osteomyelitis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with chronic ulcers in foot/heel and concern for
osteomyelitis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for osteomyelitis
BOTH FEET AND ANKLES

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2188-4-25**], there has
been loss of the soft tissues about the posterior aspect of the
calcaneus bilaterally. The calcaneus itself shows sclerosis
involving the posterior aspect on the right and much of the bone
on the left. In view of the soft tissue changes and history of
diabetes, chronic osteomyelitis must be strongly considered.

On the left, there is a bizarre appearance of the metatarsal
heads and phalanges. Striking hammertoes are seen as well as
apparent erosive change involving the head of the first
metatarsal and displacement of the proximal phalanx. There also
appears to be virtually no soft tissue covering the residual
head of the first metatarsal on this side.

The left ankle appears grossly within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Severe changes involving the calcaneus bilaterally
with loss of overlying soft tissues and probable chronic
osteomyelitis. Disorganization of the phalanges of the left toe
with probable osteomyelitic change and loss of soft tissues
about the head of the first metatarsal.

SACRUM/COCCYX  [**2191-4-26**] 7:28 PM

SACRUM/COCCYX

Reason: assess for osteomyelitis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with chronic ulcers in foot/heel/ sacrum and
concern for osteomyelitis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for osteomyelitis
HISTORY: Chronic ulcers in foot, heel, and sacrum, suggestive of
osteomyelitis.

FINDINGS: No evidence of bone abnormality. The sacroiliac joints
appear to be well maintained.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2191-4-23**]  7:58:16 AM


Sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions. Left
atrial
abnormality. Poor R wave progression. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2190-12-7**] the ventricular rate is slightly faster.


Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]

CHEST PORTABLE AP.

COMPARISON: [**2190-12-6**].

HISTORY: Change in mental status.

FINDINGS: There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms is
concerning for a left lower lobe pneumonia. The mediastinal
contours are unremarkable. The remainder of the lung is clear.
There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The osseous structures
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity concerning for
infection




Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old man with hx of multiple sclerosis c/b paraplegia,
DM2, PUD, agitated depression, and aspiration presenting from
nursing home after being found unresponsive, hypotensive,
hypoxic, and with evidence of GI bleed.

#  Septic Shock: Patient was admitted with a lactate of 5.4,
bandemia (21 bands) and signs of end-organ dysfunction (mental
status and elevated Cr) in setting of likely infection, so
sepsis was the most likely etiology. [**Month (only) 116**] also be complicated by
a GI bleed as patient has had significant UGIB in the past.
Diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and UTI, proteus. started
initially on zosyn and vancomycin with a plan to complete course
of 14 days total (last dat [**2191-5-6**]). Labs and vanco level to be
done in [**3-15**] days post discharge.
The pt was transiently CMO in ICU but given clinical improvement
CMO was reversed and pt is DNR/DNI and transferred to floor for
further management.

# Acute blood loss anemia on admission: patient has hx of severe
PUD with gastritis and visible vessel now with BRBPR and
decrease (although mild) in Hct.  Per PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]??????s baseline is
26-28. hematocrit as above at discharge. Got 2 units PPRBC and
hct slowly trickling down but stable. No acute bleed noted. CBC
recommended at NH next week and prn transfusion as needed. [**Hospital1 **]
PPI was given.

# Altered Mental status: Was likely due to above issues and
improved to baseline by discharge. Meds held initially and
slowly added back. At discharge he was on 9am and 1 pm dose of
ativan but not on 5pm and 9pm dose. Can be restarted at NH
depending on pt's mental state.

# Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal +/- ATN. Improved to
baseline with fluids.

# Chronic osteomyelitis of both feet - evaluated by podiatry and
ID who recommended wound care. No acute surgical intervention
recommended. Wound care consult obtained and see attached
consult for further wound care recommendations. ID did not
recommend long course of abx beyond 2 weeks.

# Aspiration precautions maintained - Seen by Speech and swallow
consult and they recommended ground solids and thick liquids
initially and then advanced to this liquids. However, pt seemed
to aspirate on thin liquids and so changed back to thick
liquids.

History of Present Illness:
51 yo female with h/o multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder,
dementia, frequent [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital 91805**] Hospital with
elevated troponin and depressed ejection fraction (45%) in the
context of a recently seizure occurring during a prep for a
colonoscopy, which resulted in subsequent [**Last Name (un) **] and bilateral
DVT's.  Patient initially presented to the OSH on [**2-29**] with a
hematocrit of 26.5 with a ? slow Hct drop, upon which she
received 3 units PRBCs, and underwent EGD and colonoscopy, with
reportedly no noted active bleeding, and a small ulcer and polyp
(unclear location).  On [**3-2**] the patient experienced seizure-like
activity, was found to be in status epilepticus and loaded with
valium and dilantin.  She was subsequently found to be flaccid
on her right side with a right facial droop.  Head CT was
performed and reportedly negative.  LENIs were done and showed
bilateral clots in the common femoral vein, and patient was
started on Lovenox.  In addition, patient was found to have a
troponin of 1.12 and a BNP of 1600, for which an ECG, which
showed normal sinus rhythm with no ECG changes, and
echocardiogram was performed and showed an EF of 45% and
decreased wall motion.  There was some concern for possible PFO
causing embolism from legs to the brain, and is being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization on Monday, accepted by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient also has an E.coli UTI and is currently on
IV piperacillin/tazobactam.  Patient has also received an
unclear amount of [**Name (NI) 91806**] for hypernatremia.
.
Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to further evaluate elevated
troponin with plan for left heart cath and evaluation for PFO as
a cause for stroke.  Trops here ~0.3 persistently, CKMB normal,
so cath was not pursued; cardiac enzymes thought to be due to
demand ischemia plus renal failure.  Pt was also treated with
pip/tazo x5 days for UTI, which may have lowered her seizure
threshold. She had a 24hr video EEG, which was negative for
seizure activity.  She also had MRA/MRI of head/neck which
showed possible new L hippocampus lesion seen on DWI but not
FLAIR.  She developed new significant right sided hemiparesis
and word-finding difficulty. Pt was evaluated by neurology;
symptoms thought to be due to [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis secondary to
seizure. She is currently minimally verbal, but alert and
responsive, withdrawals all limbs to pain. Per her family, Pt's
post-ictal states generally last for 2-3 days. Pt was initially
monitored in cardiac care unit but transferred to medical floor
for further management after ACS was felt to be unlikely and
cardiac cath not to be indicated.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.

IMAGING / Studies:

OSH: [**2180-3-1**] EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] Pathology report:
-distal esophagus biopsy: severe monilial (candidal) esophagitis
w/ numerous exudates continaing abundant fungal pseudohyphae
highlighted on AB PAS stain. No intestinal metaplasia.
-proximal esophagus. Mild monilial esophagitis w/ few fungal
pseudohyphae on PAS-D stain.
-gastric polyp. Fundic gland polyp.

OSH: [**2180-3-1**] EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] procedure report:
-EGD: small hiatal hernia, patchy grade I candidiasis in whole
esophagus, erythema and edema w/ early linearl ulcerations in
the antrum, stomach body, and fundus, compatible w/ diffuse
gastritis and ulcerations, but no active bleeding. Erythema,
erosion, congestion and irregular margins w/ inflammatory polyp
in distal esophagus in the GE junction and lower [**1-4**] of
esophagus compatible w/ esophagitis and GERD. Several
semi-pedunculated non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance in
gastric body consistent w/ fundic gland polyps. Normal duodenum.
-[**Last Name (un) **]: normal terminal ileum, small grade 2 non-bleeding
internal hemorrhoids

[**3-5**] Video EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of the continued presence of slowing over the left
lateral temporal region suggestive of a structural abnormality
with superimposed interictal epileptic activity. Compared to the
prior day's recording, there was some improvement over the
previous days' recording with less interictal epileptic activity
and improvement of frequencies across the left hemisphere.

[**2180-3-4**] MR brain, MRA neck:
1. MRI brain shows extensive atrophy and chronic changes from
multiple sclerosis. Increased signal in the left hippocampus
could be due to ischemia or due to post-seizure changes. It does
not appear to be artifactual given the asymmetry, a followup
study can help.
2. MRA of the head and neck are unremarkable without stenosis,
occlusion or aneurysm.

[**2180-3-4**] Radiology PORTABLE ABDOMEN
There are no ureteral stents. There are multiple bilateral
kidney stones larger and greater in number on the right side.
Osseous structures are unremarkable. Multiple surgical clips
project in the pelvis. There is nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

[**2180-3-7**] 9:56 AM # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91807**]   COMPLETE GU U.S.
1. Massive left hydronephrosis with hydroureter to the UPJ. The
left kidney contains several large shadowing gallstones and
debris with [**Doctor Last Name 5691**] is seen in the left renal collecting system
and may be present within the left ureter. 2. Minimal
hydronephrosis seen in the right kidney with multiple shadowing
stones seen in the right renal collecting system. 3. Echogenic
kidneys consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.
Additionally, the left kidney demonstrates some cortical
thinning which may be related to the hydronephrosis.

[**2180-3-7**] 4:09 PM CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CO
IMPRESSION: 1. Massive hydronephrosis of the left kidney which
demonstrates delayed nephrogram and no excretion of contrast.
Cortical thinning suggests a chronic process. Multiple calculi
layering within the distended calices. There is significant
inflammatory fat stranding around the left kidney in addition to
an ill-defined 2.9 x 1.3 cm heterogeneous region adjacent to the
anterior cortex which is of uncertain etiology. This may
represent an area of phlegmonous change from possible prior
calyceal rupture, however, neoplasm or infection are not
excluded. If prior imaging is available, this would be
beneficial for comparison. 2. Transition at the left
ureteropelvic junction with urothelial hyperenhancement in the
normal-caliber left ureter. There is no stone or eccentric
enhancement. In addition to periureteral fat stranding, there
are multiple enlarged enhancing abnormal lymph nodes in the left
periaortic region. Findings may relate to inflammatory changes
secondary to reflux and stricture, however urothelial tumor
cannot be excluded. If retrograde urologic evaluation and
stenting is not able to be performed due to ileal loop anatomy,
consider antegrade left renal decompression and brushings via
percutaneous nephrostomy. 3. Mild-to-moderate right
hydronephrosis. There are multiple layering stones within the
collecting system on the right. There is no ureteral calculus.
Mild inflammatory stranding around the proximal ureter noted.
There are multiple areas of cortical thinning on the right
suggesting prior infection/insult. Results regarding the severe
left hydronephrosis and associated findings were discussed with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53899**] on [**2180-3-7**] at 1700 via telephone. 4.
Bilateral central hypodense regions in the common femoral and
external iliac veins. Given symmetry, flow-related artifact is
suggested. However, if the patient has risk factors for DVT or
symptoms to suggest DVT, further imaging could be considered.

ECG: Scooped/upsloping 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in the
inferior/lateral precordial leads. 1 mm STE in V1. Similar to
prior ECG from 12 hours prior at OSH. No other ECGs for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
51F w/ PMH multiple sclerosis c/b dementia and neurogenic
bladder, seizure disorder, and frequent [**Hospital **] transferred from
[**Hospital 91805**] Hospital after developing a seizure on [**3-2**], AMS, and
acute renal insufficiency.

#Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: Pt developed significant new
right hemiplegia and word finding difficulty after her seizure
on [**3-2**]. Per her family, she generally has a [**2-4**] day post-ictal
state after her seizures. Pt had a CT at OSH, which was read by
in-house rads showing no acute process. Pt was seen by
neurology, who recommended 24 hr video EEG, which showed
continued presence of slowing over the left lateral temporal
region suggestive of a structural abnormality with superimposed
interictal epileptic activity, and MRA/MRI which prelim showed
chronic MS, and MRA with left hippocampus changes consistent
with ischemia lesion seen on DWI, but not on FLAIR. Currently
feel that symptoms most likely due to post-ictal state ([**Doctor Last Name 555**]
paralysis) vs infection vs toxic metabolic state from renal
failure. Neurology feels that [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis vs continuing
seizures are most likely, especially since Pt has waxing [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
course. Pt has been doing better overall and continues to
improve daily, becoming more interactive and gaining strength.
Pt will need intensive physical therapy, but expect steady
improvement.

# seizure: Pt developed seizure whilst on phenytoin at OSH, but
per husband, level was steadily decreasing, down to 5 when goal
is [**10-21**]. Also, Pt was getting bowel prep for colonoscopy, which
may have altered electrolytes, also received amp and pip/tazo
for UTI, also getting methotrexate, any of which may lower
seizure threshold. Pt's phenytoin level currently
supratherapeutic at 24.7 (corrected for albumin). However, 24 hr
video EEG, showed continued presence of slowing over the left
lateral temporal region suggestive of a structural abnormality
with superimposed interictal epileptic activity. MRA/MRI showed
chronic MS, and MRA with left hippocampus changes consistent
with ischemia lesion seen on DWI, but not on FLAIR. Neurology
feels that hippocampal lesion most consistent with post-ictal
change, but concerning for continuing seizures. Will repeat
video EEG. Decreased phenytoin to 200 [**Hospital1 **] because Pt was
supratherapeutic, which may actually induce seizures and
confusion. Pt had a repeat video EEG on [**3-7**], which did not
show any seizure activity.

Free phenytoin level very high at 2.8 on [**3-7**]. Held phenytoin on
[**3-8**]. Based on 22.6% free to total phenytoin ratio, will hold
phenytoin until free phenytoin is < 2, which correlates to total
phenytoin of 8.86 in this patient. Per her outpatient
neurologist's coverage, pharmacy, and husband, Pt has never been
tried on levetiracetam. Neurology agrees with adding
levetiracetam at 20mg/kg divided into 2 daily doses. Follow-up
has been scheduled in the [**Hospital1 18**] neurology [**Hospital1 **] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (phone [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2100**], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91808**]). They will follow Pt's phenytoin levels and adjust as
needed. Pt was discharged on levetiracetam 500mg po bid (D1 =
[**2180-3-10**]), phenytoin at 100mg po tid (discharge level total
phenytoin 13.1, Free 2.0, % free 15%). Pt will need repeat serum
phenytoin level checked on [**3-20**], faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91809**]. Levels
will be adjusted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

#bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses: Pt was
incidentally found to have bilateral DVTs at OSH after reporting
calf pain. DVTs considered provoked given wheelchair bound. Pt
was started on heparin drip and transitioned to warfarin.
Heparin drip was discontinued on [**3-8**] after INR was above 2.0
for 2 days, but INR dropped to 1.7 likely due to lower dose of
warfarin and possibly several interacting medications. Pt was
restarted on enoxaparin 70mg sc bid bridge and warfarin was
increased to 4 mg po daily. Pt will need daily INR check until
therapeutic and stable, at which point enoxparin may be
discontinued. This should be monitored by facility MD.

# UTI: patient has long standing h/o of neurogenic bladder.
Underwent a ileal loop urinary diversion in [**2172-5-2**] and has
urostomy in place. Has had multiple UTI. Currently, had UCx at
OSH that grew >100k colonies pan-sensitive enterococcus and >
10k colonies of pan-sensitive E.coli, which was initially
treated with oral ampicillin then switched to zosyn (unclear
when switched) for UTI. Per husband, was treated for 1 week w/
amp prior to OSH admission. Enterococcus is typically resistant
to piperacillin, so not clear if was adequately treated,
although repeat UCx from [**3-4**] showed < 10k colonies. Pt
currently afebrile w/ normal WBC and diff, but urine does have
significant white sediment. OSH renal ultrasound showed
echogenic material in L renal pelvis, concerning for possible
infectious material. Sent repeat UA, UCx on [**3-5**]. UA dirty,
UCx showed mixed flora. Repeat ultrasound showed massive L
hydronephrosis and hydroureter, several gallstones and debris in
L renal collecting system, minimal R hydronephrosis, multiple
stones in R collecting system. Given that multiple urine
cultures showed mixed flora or low growth, in the future, no
need to treat unless there is a predominance of one organism and
Pt is symptomatic.

# Acute renal failure: likely pre-renal in the setting of colon
prep, FeNa 0.68, received fluids, Cr improved to 1.7 from 2.1.
Unclear what baseline is. Per OSH renal ultrasound, Pt has
severe L hydronephrosis w/ possible infectious material in L
renal pelvis and moderate right hydronephrosis. Repeat renal
ultrasound on [**3-6**] showed massive L hydronephrosis, several
stones in bilateral kidneys, and cortical thinning on L. Urology
was consulted, who wanted CT urogram, which showed massive L
hydronephrosis w/ no excretion of contrast, cortical thinning,
multiple calculi, significant inflammatory fat stranding around
L kidney, and ill-defined 2.9 x 1.3 cm heterogeneous region next
to anterior cortex of unclear etiology. Also multiple enlarged
enhancing abnormal lymph nodes in left periaortic region, which
may be reactive inflammatory changes due to reflux and stricture
(but urothelial tumor cannot be excluded). Also showed mild
moderate right hydronephrosis w/ multiple layering stones.
Urology did not feel that there was any need to intervene due to
the likely chronic nature of these processes; wanted urine
cultures from bladder reminant and ileal urostomy. They were not
concerned about the ill-defined lesion adjacent to left anterior
cortex and suggested outpatient urological follow-up. Repeat
urine culture from bladder reminant shows no growth. Repeat
urine culture from ileal urostomy showed mixed flora consistent
with fecal contamination. Contact[**Name (NI) **] and updated outpatient
urologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31365**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 91810**] about Pt's imaging
findings and concern for possible L ureter urothelial
malignancy. Will have [**Hospital1 1501**] arrange follow-up in [**2-5**] wks w/ Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 31365**]. Urine cytology was ordered and will need to be followed
up. Pt should have repeat Cr check in 1 week to ensure no major
changes.
.
# [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis: Per OSH EGD biopsy path report from [**3-1**], [**2180**], Pt had extensive distal and mild proximal candidal
esophagitis w/ numerous exudates continaing abundant fungal
pseudohyphae on PAS. Unclear if this may have been the source of
fever / infection after her [**3-1**] EGD at the OSH. Pt currently
not voicing symptoms and eating well, but will treat given
description of extensive disease. Pt was started fluconazole
400mg po daily and should continue a 3 wk course ending [**3-28**].
Further assessment to be guided by Pt symptoms.
.
# Elevated troponin: Per cardiology, Pt's troponin was likely
due to seizures and renal failure, very low suspicion of ACS.
Apparently, her troponin of 1.1 at OSH was a troponin I, so not
comparable to our troponins. Here troponin 0.37 -> 0.28 -> 0.18.
CKs flat. Would not characterize Pt has having a NSTEMI.
Cardiology fellow felt that Pt should have repeat Echo given
abnormal findings at OSH. Pt's repeat Echo at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-7**]
does show mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with basal to mid septal and inferior hypokinesis. Repeat ECG
showed normal sinus rhythm, HR 96, normal axis, no q waves, ST
changes, or T wave changes, no evidence of ischemia. Cardiology
feels that wall motion abnormality may have been due to a prior
silent MI or non-coronary cardiomyopathy. Suggested starting a
beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor once creatinine improves. Pt was
started on metoprolol tartrate, which was uptitrated to 25mg po
bid due to high heart rate to 100s with good response and HR in
70s-80s on discharge. Pt was not started on an ACE inhibitor due
to low normal SBP in 100s. Outpatient cardiology follow-up was
arranged with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] at [**Hospital1 18**], who may consider pharmalogical
stress w/ imaging.

# Anemia: likely anemia of chronic disease vs effect of
methotrexate given normocytic, normal iron 81, ferritin 2907.
Unclear baseline. Pt had an EGD and colonoscopy, with reportedly
no noted active bleeding, and a small ulcer and polyp (unclear
location). No report included in OSH records, but Pt apparently
had distal esophagitis gastritis, and erosions on [**2179-11-8**]
EGD, also history of colonic and gastric polyps. Continue PPI
and monitor Hcts. EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] performed at [**Hospital3 24768**] in
[**State 792**]showed small hiatal hernia, patchy grade I
candidiasis in whole esophagus, erythema and edema w/ early
linearl ulcerations in the antrum, stomach body, and fundus,
compatible w/ diffuse gastritis and ulcerations, but no active
bleeding. Erythema, erosion, congestion and irregular margins w/
inflammatory polyp in distal esophagus in the GE junction and
lower [**1-4**] of esophagus compatible w/ esophagitis and GERD. Pt
was started on omeprazole 40mg po daily, which should be
continued until patient is evaluated by her outpatient
gastroenterologist. This will need to be arranged by PCP once
her other medical conditions stabilize. PCP may also pursue
further anemia workup.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis: stable, rx w/ methotrexate complicated by
hemorrhagic cystitis. Pt typically gets methotrexate 20mg po
qSaturday (but did not receive it during this admission). Spoke
with covering [**Hospital 112**] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 91811**] [**Name (STitle) **], who
advised holding methotrexate until Hct stabilizes and seizures
are under control since methotrexate may lower seizure
threshold. She also advised to give methylprednisolone 1g iv
bolus on [**3-10**] (on monthly schedule). Pt will follow-up with
her MS specialist and discuss when to resume methotraxate. We
tried to arrange MS [**Name13 (STitle) 702**] with [**Hospital 112**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **], but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91811**]
[**Name (STitle) **] did not allow this to be scheduled and suggested that Pt
follow-up with an epilepsy specialist. Given stability of blood
counts, Pt was discharged with instruction to resume her prior
regimen of methotrexate  20mg po qSaturday and
methylprednisolone 1g iv bolus on the 9th of each month pending
appointment with her MS caregivers at [**Name (NI) 112**].
.
# Prolonged Qtc - chronic, typically 500s, would need serial
ECGs if giving any meds that would prolong it further
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-phenytoin levels need to be followed and dosing adjusted as
necessary; may be able to transition off phenytoin w/
levetiracetam monotherapy to be determined by [**Hospital1 18**] neurology
-INR needs to be checked regularly and warfarin dose adjusted
for goal INR 2.0-3.0. Needs anticoagulation for at least 6
months for provoked bilateral lower extremity DVTs
-possible L ureter urothelial malignancy and L massive
hydronephrosis, mild-moderate right hydronephrosis and extensive
renal calculi needs to be evaluated by outpatient urologist.
Urine cytology was ordered and will need to be followed-up by
urologist / PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] needs regular Cr check to assess make sure
renal function is not worsening
-continued outpatient workup of anemia
-need to clarify multiple sclerosis care with [**Hospital 112**] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 91812**]s. Should clarify whether her current regimen of
methotrexate  20mg po qSaturday and methylprednisolone 1g iv
bolus on the 9th of each month needs to be adjusted or changed.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91813**],

You were transferred to our hospital because your doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 91814**] [**Name5 (PTitle) 2985**] that you were having a heart attack. Your heart
specialists at [**Hospital1 18**] did not feel that you were having a heart
attack, but your heart scan showed that it was pumping less
effectively than normal. We have arranged for you to see our
heart specialists. You had weakness on the right side of your
body and trouble speaking after your seizures. You were
evaluated by our neurologists, who felt that you had a ""[**Doctor Last Name 555**]
paralysis"", or post-seizure disorder. Your scans did not show
any evidence of new strokes. Your seizure medications were
adjusted and you were started on a new medication. Your seizure
medications will be followed by our neurologists at [**Hospital1 18**]. You
had massive enlargement of your left kidney and left ureter. Our
urologists felt that this was chronic and suggested that you
follow-up with your outpatient urologist because of concern of a
possible cancer in the ureter. We have contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 31365**] and
made an appointment for you. You also had a fungus infection in
your esophagus and you were started on medication for this,
which you will need to continue for 3 weeks. You were found to
have blood clots in your legs, and you were started on
medication to thin your blood, which you will need to continue
for 6 months. This will be adjusted by your facility's doctor.
Your multiple sclerosis was felt to be stable, we gave you your
monthly methylprednisilone injection on [**3-10**].

We have made the following changes to your medications:

-DECREASE your phenytoin (Dilantin) to 100mg by mouth three
times daily

-START taking levetiracetam 500mg tablets, 1 tab by mouth twice
daily
-START taking warfarin 4 mg tabs, 1 tab by mouth daily
-START taking enoxaparin 70mg subcutaneous injections, twice
daily until instructed to stop by your facility doctors
-START taking fluconazole 400mg tabs, 1 tab by mouth daily,
ending on [**3-28**]
-START taking omeprazole 40mg tabs, 1 tab by mouth daily
-START taking metoprolol succinate 50 mg tabs, 1 tab by mouth
daily

We have not made any other changes to your medications. Please
continue to take them as previously prescribed.

History of Present Illness:
52 yr/o F with PmHx significant for multiple sclerosis
complicated by a seizure disorder, as well as neurogenic bladder
and hemorrhagic cystitis s/p urostomy, and recent complicated
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 91819**] from which she was discharged
to rehab, now admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for severe
leukocytosis, fevers, and worsening mental status.

OSH Course:
Was admitted to [**Hospital3 24768**] on [**2180-3-22**] due to recent
seizures at rehab and temperature documented at rehab. She was
found to hav ea saral decubitus ulcer as well as ulcerations on
the back and heels. She had a presenting temperature of 102
although she had been receiving IM Ceftriaxone at rehab for an
abscess on her back. She arrived on Dilantin 300mg TID, Aricept
10mg daily, MTX 20mg every saturday, fosamax 70mg weekly,
calcium 600mg [**Hospital1 **], Vit C 500mg daily, Vit E 400 daily, MTV
daily, Iron 65mg TID.
Initially she had a WBC of 8.3, Hgb of 9.7 with a dilantin level
WNL, a mild transaminitisi, and mild [**Last Name (un) **]. She was found to have
an abscess on her back which was I&Ded. She was started on Epo
due to anemia. ID saw the patient and she was started on
Aztreonam and Clindamycin while Fluconzole and CTX were
discontinued.
Imaging of her kidney showed mild R hydronephrosis with multiple
stones and severe left hydronephrosis with a thin cortex and it
was decided that this kidney should be decompressed with a
nephrostomy tube (there is mentioned that this was due to an
obstructing left renal stone, but patient also listed as having
known history of hydroureter). Her warfarin was stopped to allow
this and on [**2180-3-29**] a L nephrostomy tube was placed with
resolution of the hydronephrosis on follow-up imaging.
On [**2180-3-30**] her WBC increased to 20.6 with 27% bands. Her Cr
bumped to 2.6 with BUN 34. A R IJ CVL was placed. Her WBC was
relatively stable the following two days and her Cr started
trending down to 1.6. However, on the morning of [**2180-4-4**], she
became somewhat obtunded. Her vitals continued to be
unremkarkable except she developed a low grade temp of 100.1.
Her WBC rose to 27.9 with 16% bands. Surgery assessed the
back/abscess areas and thought they looked good and did not
think they were the source of the infection.
This morning, [**2180-4-5**], her WBC rose to 47.3 and she remained
obtunded. Decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was
started on PO vancomycin and IV metronidazole on the day of
transfer. The nursing staff at [**Location (un) 11790**] also notified the
nursing staff on CC7 that the patient's Cdiff toxin had come
back positive.

On the floor, initial VS 102.1, BP 102/60, HR 115, RR 22, 98% on
RA. Pt unable to meaningfully communicate due to altered mental
status, but her husband confirmed the general above information
about her recent time at [**Location (un) 11790**]. He says she started getting
altered yesterday but that at baseline she is very functional
and takes care of most of her ADLs. He says she has not been
reporting pain, including pain in the abdomen. He is unsure if
she is having diarrhea.

[**Known firstname **] was initially admitted to the floor as mentioned above
but after 12hrs was transfered to ICU for septic shock. Ultimate
cause of illness found to be Cdiff with suggestive history/exam
and positive C. diff toxin here. Abd CT also showed pan-colitis
Pt was initially started on PO Vanco/IV metronidazole and per
recs of ID team Tigecycline was later added. All other broad
spectrum Abx were peeled off after first 24hrs and after peaking
at 62.4 the WBC has been trending down over 3 subsequent days
(currently at 22.3). Her mental status has improved and her
hypotension has resolved. She never required pressor support and
while she required agressive fluid resuccitation for the first
24hrs, has been hemodynamically stable since without any
significant fluids - length of Stay ~ 16-20L positive thus far.
The R IJ placed at the OSH has been pulled and a PICC line
placed. NGT was placed in the ICU and she currently is receiving
tube feeds via this. Diarrhea improving. ID and General Surgery
are following regarding her Cdiff care.

She was obtunded at admission and mental status has improved
with Cdiff treatment. Not back to baseline yet per husband,
although he sees interval improvement. She has a history of
seizures but no obvious seizures have been witnessed here. No
EEGs or Head CT during this admission. ID initially recommended
an LP in the setting of fevers, WBC elevation, and AMS, but
after she has showed improvement with Cdiff treatment, the
decision was made not to do this, especially since she has
decubitus ulcers over the sacrum which might contaminate the LP
region. Her phenytoin was changed to fosphenytoin in the ICU to
better go through a PICC.

On presentation [**Known firstname **] had a significant acidosis with a bicarb
of 10. This has persisted during admission although all lactates
have been normal. pH has been low in the 7.2-7.3 range. All
though multi-factorial in setting of severe diarrhea, ileostomy
presence, and mild renal failure. She was started on bicarb tabs
in the ICU.

She has recent history of bilateral DVTs and was on warfarin as
an outpatient. This has been held and her INR has trended
steadily up from 1.7 on admission to 4.5 today. The hypothesis
has been that complete lack of gut function combined with no
food intake has led to significant vitamin K deficiency.

Past Medical History:
1. Multiple sclerosis - primary progressive, diagnosed in [**2151**].

Had a severe flare and deterioriation in [**2156**] with onset of
seizures. Has been steadily deteriorating since then, has been
wheelchair bound for the last 10 years. On maintenance
methotrexate therapy. Also had been receiving monthly steroid
doses. Followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital1 756**].
2. Seizure disorder - had first ""big seizure"" in [**2156**] and has
subsequently had a few ""smaller"" ones consisting of staring
spells occasionally with some facial twitching. Last one was 12
years ago, 3 episodes total. Has never been in status
epilepticus. Has always been maintained on Dilantin, which was
recently increased from 400mg total daily to 500mg total daily
within the last week due to a low level.
3. Hemorrhagic cystitis due to chronic cytoxin therapy, s/p
urostomy
4. Deep vein thrombosis [**2172**]
5. Anemia
6. Neurogenic bladder
7. Bilateral hydronephrosis (known history)
8. Tonsillectomy
9. Appendectomy
10. Multiple cystocopies with ureteral stent placement in [**2172**]
11. Cauterization of her hemorrhagic points in her urinary
bladder
12. Breast bx in [**2-/2180**]

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2180-4-6**]):
      Reported to and read back by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2180-4-6**] 12:10PM
4-3180.

         amplification.            (Reference Range-Negative).

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2180-4-6**] 1:08 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Pancolitis with wall thickening and surrounding fat
stranding. There is
no evidence for perforation, abscess formation or secondary
signs of ischemia such as portal venous air or pneumatosis.
2. Small amount of ascites surrounding the liver and spleen as
well as deep in the pelvis, all the above findings are new
compared to [**2180-4-3**].
3. Status post percutaneous nephrostomy of the left kidney. The
collecting
system is decompressed. Multiple stones are seen in the kidneys
bilaterally that are non-obstructing. Stones are identified in
the renal pelvis. The right collecting system is dilated to a
transition at the level of the iliac crest where surgical clips
are noted. This is stable

NEPHROSTOGRAM Study Date of [**2180-4-12**] 9:49 AM
TECHNIQUE: After obtaining a scout image, Optiray was injected
through
nephrostomy tube for assessment of collecting system.
FINDINGS: Optiray was seen entering the pyelocalyceal system
without any
evidence of obstruction or perinephric leakage of contrast. The
calyceal
system appears mildly dilated, consistent with known history of
hydronephrosis. There was no passage of contrast through the
ureteropelvic
junction, even though the patient was repositioned to facilitate
ureteral
drainage. The contrast was seen draining uneventfully through
the nephrostomy tube after reopening of the valve.
FINDINGS
1. Mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis.
2. Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction.

BILAT UP EXT VEINS US Study Date of [**2180-4-11**] 9:46 AM
INDICATION: 52-year-old female with PICC line and arm swelling
bilaterally.  Question DVT.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed
of bilateral upper extremities, demonstrating small amount of
non-occlusive thrombus within the right internal jugular vein,
in the location of a recently removed central venous catheter. A
PICC traverses one of the left brachial veins. There is normal
compressibility and color flow in the left internal jugular
vein, bilateral axillary, brachial, basilar, and cephalic veins.
Significant subcutaneous soft tissue edema is present.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombosis of the right internal
jugular vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
52F with significant PmHx including MS, and an MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e disorder, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with severe complicated
[**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU for septic shock with resolution
of shock and improvement in CDiff.

# Severe C. difficile colitis: admitted with a leukocytosis to
over 50,000, diarrhea and a firm abodomen, she was initially
managed on the floor overnight but continued to be hypotensive
to the 80's systolic despite aggressive IV fluid boluses, as a
result she was transferred to the MICU.  She was initially
started on po vancomycin and IV metronidazole, ID and surgery
were consulted.  Her antibiotic regimen was expanded to include
tigecycline, she underwent a CT of her abdomen and pelvis which
showed pancolitis, no evidence of pneumatosis or megacolon.  She
was closely monitored with [**Hospital1 **] lactates and serial abdominal
exams, over the next few days her white count trended down from
over 60 to 22 on [**2180-4-10**].  Her abdominal firmness and tenderness
improved and she was started on trophic tube feeds on [**4-8**], which
were advanced to almost goal when she was called out of the ICU
on [**2180-4-10**] and transferred to the medical floor. On the medical
floor, her abdomen exam was stable and WBC remained around
20,000 but patient continued to be afebrile. Given degree of
pancolitis, persistent WBC is to be expected for some short term
duration. Her abdominal exam remained unchanged but patient
continues to have some guarding but has never been rigid or
peritoneal. She will continue treatment with IV flagyl,
tigecycline and PO vancomycin until [**2180-4-21**] when the PO
vancomycin taper will begin. Her PPI was held given promotion of
CDiff risks.

# Altered Mental Status: on admission to the ICU, was altered,
not always answering questions and unable to reliably take po's.
 An NGT was placed to give oral medications, and her mental
status improved as her infection improved.  Given her recent
extensive work up, which included EEG, head CT and MRI at the
OSH (images uploaded to our system), no further work up was
pursued it was felt that this was likely due to her acute
illness as her mental status improved throughout her stay.

# Metabolic Acidosis: her bicarb was very low, between 8 and 12
during her stay, thought to be multifactorial from the diarrhea,
acute renal failure and IV fluid resuscitation with normal
saline.  She was started on po bicarb repletion on [**4-8**] with mild
improvement in her bicarb levels.  Her bicarb levels improved to
normal even after the tablets were stopped.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: she has baseline CKD, with a
Cr of 1.4-1.5, on admission it was elevated to 2.4, improved to
1.8-2.0 with IV fluid resuscitation, which pointed to a prerenal
etiology, however her creatinine plateaued at around 2.0, given
her episode of hypotension was thought to be due to possible
ATN.  Diuresis was started on [**4-10**], with good urine output
response as she was grossly volume overloaded, as there was also
concern that congestive nephropathy may have been contributing
her renal failure as well. She was continued to be diuresed with
20 IV lasix per day and is likely discharged ~10L positive in
Total body water but continues to diuereis on her own as well
and thus giving additional lasix at rehab is optional. Her
creatinine on D/C is about 1.4 which seems to be her baseline.

# Left nephrostomy tube: This was placed at outside hospital
prior to admission for concern of left hydronephrosis and
elevated creatinine. The urine output from the nephrostomy drain
was no more than 100-200 cc/day while the urostomy put up to
3000 cc/day on certain days. A nephrostogram was done to assess
functionality of this drain which revealed mild to moderated
hydronephrosis of the left kidney with obstruction of the
ureteropelvic junction. On [**2180-4-14**], she self-discontinued her
nephrostomy tube accidentally. Urology was consulted who felt
that the drain did not need to be replaced based on the fact
that her creatinine seemed to be near her baseline level. They
also felt that keeping the drain in would be an infection risk
and they argued that it shouldn't have been placed at the
outside hospital initially given their suspicion that her left
kidney renal function was very minimal and not physiologically
signficant even prior to hospitalization. They advised she
followup with her outpatient urologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] witihn
the next 2 weeks to address any further urologic management
issues.

# Bilateral Lower Extremity DVT's: was on coumadin prior to
admission, INR was subtherapeutic on admission but her coumadin
was held and her INR increased in the setting of antibiotic
administration, no evidence of bleeding so she was not given
vitamin K and her INR was just monitored. She was re-started on
coumadin once deemed safe.

# Right IJ non-occlusive thrombus: in location where CVL was
thus has provoked etiology. Currently anticoagulated on warfarin
for DVTs as well.

# Nutritional Status: albumin less than 2. Tube feeds were
continued through NGTube.
And orals started with speech and swallow eval giving ok for
modified diet.

# Multiple Sclerosis:   Followed at [**Hospital1 112**] for this. Has been
receiving weekly methotrexate and monthly steroids, but per
husbands report no recently (since beginning of [**Month (only) 958**]). Sounds
like she is reasonably functional at home despite her disease.
We held any immune suppressing medications in setting of
infection and this should be followed as outpatient.

# Seizure Disorder:
Long-standing and though [**2-3**] to multiple sclerosis. Has been on
both phenytoin and LeVETiracetam for this. Phenytoin levels were
fine at OSH and no reports of seizure-like activity while
admitted there, although one of reasons rehab sent her there was
this.  We continued Phenytoin Sodium Extended 100 mg PO TID as
well as LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].

# Anemia:
This appears to be chronic and is at recent baseline. Guiac
positive stool but to be expected in setting of colonic
infection. Anemia likely multi-factorial and due to multiple
chronic disease states and recent illnesses.

Blood culture [**3-15**], [**3-16**], [**3-18**] NGTD (pending)
Urine culture [**3-17**] final negative

Imaging:
.
CXR [**3-15**]- Low lung volumes, making evaluation of the lateral
view
suboptimal. Given this, there is right>left bibasilar linear
atelectasis/scarring without definite focal consolidation.

CTA [**3-15**]-
1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Streaky density in the right lower lobe may represent
atelectasis,
aspiration, or early infection.
3. Hepatic cysts.

CXR [**3-16**]:
Bibasilar opacities -- ? atelectasis and/or scarring -- are
unchanged. Due to respiratory motion, there is limited
assessment for focal infiltrate on the lateral view.

Renal U/S [**3-17**]:
Normal renal ultrasound. No evidence of perinephric fluid
collection.

[**3-19**] CXR (PICC placement)
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided

[**3-20**] RUE US - no hematoma



Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F with h/o MS presenting with shortness of breath and
chest pain, found to have sepsis with unclear infectious source,
PNA vs UTI.

# SEPSIS
Patient met SIRS criteria for septic shock on admission with
fever, white count, and tachycardia. Likely source was urinary
+/- PNA (see below). Patient denied abdominal pain, and had no
diarrhea; however, with recent antibiotics, also at risk for
c.difficile. Patient broadly covered with vancomycin, cefepime
and flagyl; flagyl stopped 4d prior to discharge with plan to
continue vanc/cefepime via PICC line for 7-day course to end
[**3-22**].
.
# HYPOTENSION
On the evening of admission patient was noted to be hypotensive
to systolic 60s. This was in the context of receiving a total of
2L ivf since admission and home lasix, hctz, furosemide as well
as her home sedating medications: seroquel, trazodone, doxepin,
tizanidine, klonopin, fexophenadine. Patient was noted to be A+O
x 1 during this episode. Due to her hypotension she was
transferred to the MICU where she was aggressively fluid
resuscitated with 6L NS. Required pressure support w/ levophed
overnight. Mental status improved with improving blood pressure.
Her home blood pressure medications were held as were her
sedating medications; these were gradually restarted
w/stabilization of BPs and treatment of underlying infections.
.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION
Her urinalysis on arrival showed evidence of infection with
+leuk/nitrites, and mod bacteria but only 4 WBC. Urine culture
grew pan-sensitive Proteus and enterococcus, which would be
covered by the vanc/cefepime regimen started on admission.
Repeat urine culture clean.
.
# PNEUMONIA
Admission CXR and CT scan showed RLL opacity, and she was
hypoxic to 91% on RA. We note that diagnosis of PNA uncertain,
as she could also have low lung volumes because of atelectasis
and decreased lung volumes secondary to her multiple sclerosis.
Also had a CTA to evaluate for PE as alternate explanation for
hypoxia - this was negative for PE despite elevated d-dimer.
Received vanc/cefepime as discussed above.Patient was maintained
on supplemental O2 (3L) through NC in ICU and placed on PRN
nebs. CXR on day of admission showed some vascular congestion
(likely from all the IVF she had gotten for sepsis), so she was
diuresed w/ lasix 40mg IV x1, with good response, before being
sent back to [**Hospital1 1501**] on increased dose of lasix 40mg PO daily x 1
week (will need lytes checked) with plan to decrease back to 20
QD after 1 week.
.
# Multiple sclerosis
Chronc progresive, with limited mobility. Has chronic suprapubic
catheter for neurogenic bladder. She was continued on tizanadine
standing and as needed per home regimen for bladder spasms. Also
continued on bowel regimen per home regimen, naprosyn and
tylenol for pain.
.
# Hypertension
Continued home metoprolol and HCTZ
.
# Depression
Continued home medications unchanged.
.
# Allergic rhinitis
Continued home medications.

# Transitional issues-
- monitor respiratory status, nebulizer requirement (expect this
to wean)
- needs follow-up chem7 check on Monday [**3-24**] while on increased
dose lasix
- ensure patient returns to 20 PO lasix QD after 1 week;
reassess volume status by lung exam and adjust lasix dosing
thereafter PRN
- PICC line to be pulled by [**Hospital1 1501**] after abx complete (3 more days,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname 94473**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, and also had low
blood pressures. For this, you were given fluids and
antibiotics, and you improved. You will need IV antibiotics for
a few more days, so you are getting a PICC line in order to get
these.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
** START vancomycin [antibiotic] for 3 additional days, end [**3-22**]
** START cefepime [antibiotic] for 3 additional days, end [**3-22**]
** START ALBUTEROL NEB TREATMENTS, [**11-25**] EVERY 4-6 HOURS AS-NEEDED
** INCREASE lasix to 40 mg daily for 1 week, then go abck to
taking 20 mg daily.
** STOP BACTRIM


Followup Instructions:
Further follow up per Skilled Nursing Facility MD

You will need to have labs checked in 4 days, to check your
sodium and creatinine levels while on an increased dose of
lasix.

65 yo female with history of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45862**] catheter and
recurrent UTIs presenting with sepsis [**12-26**] UTI and hypotension
requiring MICU admission.

Active Diagnoses

#Sepsis: Pt with history of multiple UTIs likely [**12-26**] [**Month/Day (2) 45862**]
cath that she has had x 20 years.  Leukocytosis and fever with
positive UA indicative of UTI.  Pt grew pansensitive proteus and
enterococcus species in the past.  Original allergy list stated
patient was alleric to ciprofloxacin, however upon conversation
with the patient, this was determined to be incorrect. The
morning of [**5-24**] the patient's vanc/cefepime was d/c'd and she
recieved one dose of lefofloxaxin 500mg PO on [**5-24**] (could not
give ciprofloxacin since interacted with tizanidine).  Over the
course of the day, the patient was intermittnetly diaphoretic.
She was noted to have a low grade temp of 100.4 x1, though it
came down to ~98 in a few minutes.  Her blood pressure remained
stable and HR in the low 100s all day.  At approximately 9:30PM
that evening, she was triggered for a SBP<80 and for chest pain.
 On exam she was noted to be febrile and diaphoretic,
hypotensive to the 70s/40s, and to have a normal heart rate and
O2sat on room air.  An EKG was unchanged from prior, and upon
further questioning her chest pain was described as her chronic
esophagitis pain.  Blood and urine cultures were drawn, a CXR
showed no change from prior, and she was given 1L of fluids.
After the fluids went in, her BP was rechecked and was noted to
be persistently 70s/40s.  At this point the was transfered to
the MICU for further monitoring.  Aggressive fluid resusciation.
Also, started on broad spectrum abx (vancomycin and cefepime),
narrowed to levaquin, but restored to Vanc/cefepime after
clinically worsening and requiring MICU level care.  Vancomycin
was stopped due to culture results of Klebsiella and
Pseudomonas.  Will need 10 day course of cefepime to end on
[**2110-6-3**].  Sensitivities pending and will call [**Hospital1 1501**] to followup
for change in antibiotics if necessary.

#Hypotension:  Likely caused by sepsis [**12-26**] UTI.  No tachycardic
response to hypovolemia but it is there is high likelihood of
autonomic instablity caused by chronic MS.  Pt also on b-blocker
at home.  She responded to 5L fluid resuscitation. Her home
b-blocker was held.  Also held home sedatives, restarted on
discharge due to return to normal BP.  on Discharge
120s-130s/70s.

#Chest pain: One episode of chest pain [**5-24**] that was similar to
previous episodes of heartburn.  Pain resolved without
intervention.  EKG without changes.  Probable heartburn.  Less
likely cardiac in origin.

Chronic Diagnoses

#MS: Pt with MS for 30 years, not followed by a neurologist, not
currently on any MS medications. Continued tizanidine for
bladder spasms.

#Depression/Anxiety: Patient with chronic depression on multiple
antidepressants that were initially continued on admission. Of
note, she received the QHS doses of each of these the night of
[**2110-5-24**], prior to her hypotensive episode that brought her to
the MICU. Thereafter, the clonazepam, trazodone, quetiapine and
doxepin were discontinued due to sedating properties and
possibility of further hypotension.

#Constipation: Pt with chronic constipation. Continued home
meds: Simethicone, Docusate, Senna.

Transitional Issues
-Sensitivities pending for urine culture
-In future episodes of sepsis, would consider holding sedating
meds.
-Would recommend reconciliation of psych meds in general.
-Code status:  full code

Pertinent Results:
[**12-6**] LENIS- IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive occlusive thrombosis involving the right lower
extremity deep
veins extending from the calf veins to the level of the common
femoral vein.
2. No DVT in the left lower extremity deep veins.

[**12-7**] NCHCT- IMPRESSION: High density demonstrated in the region
of the known ring-enhancing lesion centered in the left temporal
lobe compatible with a component of post-biopsy parenchymal
hemorrhage. There is a larger region of high attenuation
throughout the left temporal lobe which either may represent
delayed hyperenhancement and/or a component of hemorrhage. If of
clinical concern, MR can be obtained for differentiation.

[**12-8**] Head CT /c contrast:
IMPRESSION: Persistent though collapsed area of rim enhancement
demonstrated with central hypoattenuation and surrounding edema
centered within the left temporal lobe after known aspiration.
No evidence of interval hemorrhage.

[**2118-12-7**] CXR
Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. No lung opacities of
concern. Top normal heart size. Mediastinal and hilar contours
are
unchanged. Moderate atherosclerotic calcification in aortic arch
is present.  A skinfold in the right upper lateral lung should
not be confused for pneumothorax. Focal dense calcification in
the left lateral aspect of upper neck is probably within the
carotid artery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old woman was admitted to the neurosurgery
service on [**2118-12-5**]. A family meeting was held to discuss
goals of care. It was decided to perform a brain biopsy to
further assess this temporal lesion. Lower extremity duplexes
were also performed revealing an extensive clot in her right
leg. The family also agreed to IVC filter placement.
Preoperative labs and studies were ordered including an
infectious work up.

On [**12-7**] she underwent IVC Filter placement and a brain
biopsy/aspiration. This was without complication. She was
extubated post operatively and started on triple antibiotics.
Post op Head CT revealed no hemorrhage.

Head CT with contrast on [**12-8**] revealed partial resolution of
abscess with peristent edema. She was neurologically stable and
afebrile. ID was consulted and recommended increasing the doses
of her antibiotics. A PICC line was requested in anticipation of
long term antibiotics and lack of venous access.

On [**12-9**] she was again stable therefore she was cleared for
transfer to the stepdown unit and a slow decadron taper was
ordered. It was recommended that she be started on
anticoagulation treatment for her DVT therfore she was started
on Lovenox and ASA 81mg.

On [**12-11**],The patient exam was stable.  The patient is alert to
name but dysphasic, eyes are open spontaneously, follows
commands with promting.  The patient will move toes and lift
legs off the bed to command.  The patient is purposeful with
upper extremities and strength is full although pt does not
participate in isolated muscle motor exam.

Infectious disease recommended discontinuation of vancomycin,
initiation of CeftriaXONE 2 gm IV Q12H, and continuation of
MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500 mg IV Q8H.  Infectious disease would
also like to have the patient follow up with them in 4 weeks
with a MRI Brain with and without contrast.  The patient's son
and health care proxy was updated over the telephone regarding
the infectious disease recommendations and changes to the
antibiotics.  The patient was anxious throughout the day and
given 0.5 ativan with good relief of anxiety. Serum magnesium
and postassium were low and were repleated.

She was hypertensive to 180's on [**2118-12-11**] but responded well to
lopressor and hydralazine. She was afebrile and neurologically
unchanged on [**12-12**]. She had an MRI brain on [**12-13**] and was being
prepared for transfer to rehab. Her MRI showed no acute
abnormalities, her exam was stable, and she was deemed fit for
transfer to rehab on the morning of [**2118-12-13**].

Chief Complaint:
trigeminal neuralgia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided suboccipital craniotomy for microvascular
    decompression.


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 69-year-old, R hande female who was seen by me
for discussion of role of surgery (open vs RFA) and SRS
radiation
therapy, her presumed trigeminal neuralgia.

HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 94911**] is known to have multiple sclerosis for many
years.  More recently, she has developed debilitating facial
pain
localized to her R sided V2-V3/ jaw area. This has been
triggered
with mouth opening and she initially thought this was
related to dentures.   It did not resolve.  Her pain is
persistent with episodic exacerbations and lancetting pain.

She is being followed up by her neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
multiple sclerosis, who presumed that this could be trigeminal
neuroalgia.  She does have ongoing right-sided weakness from her
multiple sclerosis adn is whellchair bound.

The pain was in the cheek area and sometimes in the mucosa, more
centered around the V2 distribution, mostly near her jaw close
to
her TMJ area.  She does not have any eye symptoms, no visual
problems, nor taste sensations.  She has been treated for this
with OxyContin, anti-seizure medications, and some pain
medications with insufficient response.

She has not had invasive procedures or injections to this area.


ROS: essentially negative;
Denies any constitutional symptoms like fever, chills, or loss
of
appetite or weight.  No new eye, ear, head and neck, or ENT
symptoms other than noted above.  No new chest symptoms, but SOB
with minimal exertion.  GI and GU unchanged.  Neurological
history as above.  Musculoskeletal, allergic, of systems is
unremarkable.


Past Medical History:
Multiple sclerosis as noted above, breast
cancer, back problems, and breast surgery

Social History:
She has been a social worker.  She has a long
history of smoking, but does not abuse alcohol.

ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented for elective decompression of the right
trigeminal nerve for trigeminal neuralgia. See operative report
for details, but briefly the procedure was complicated by
excessive venous bleeding in the setting of chronic
thrombocytopenia. Her postoperative CT head showed a
moderate-sized hematoma in the prepontine, premedullary and
cerebellopontine cisterns extending along the tentorial
leaflets, with mass effect on the pons and medulla. There was
also minimal hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle. The patient
was transfered to the ICU and received platelet and DDAVP. She
was noted to have diplopia with a right INO as well as a new
right facial droop. She was placed on dexamethasone to prevent
post surgical edema.

on [**8-3**] the patient's repeat head CT was stable but she had some
bloody secretions as well as coffee ground emesis. Her incision
site continued to ooze. She was started on IV protonix and had
an NG tube placed to suction. Her platelets remained stable
around 100. She was still successfully extubated.

On [**8-4**] overnight the patient had a desaturation to the 70s. A
chest xray showed pulmonary edema and effusions so she was
diuresed with 20mg of IV lasix which improved her respiratory
status. Follow up chest xray was concerning for aspiration
pneumonia on the right upper lobe but given the improvement in
her respiration with diuresis and lack of fever we decided to
not treat at this time. She was continued on ancef for post
surgical prophylaxis. A hematology consult was obtained for the
unusual bleeding and they felt that if bleeding continues we can
start her on prednision. They recommend that we keep her
platelets greater that 100.

[**8-5**], she remained stable in the ICU. On [**8-6**], she recieved
lasix 20mg x 1 in AM with improvement in her respiratory status.
She remained stable neurologically and transfer orders were
written for her to go to the step down unit. She complains of no
hearing deficits.

On [**8-7**] the patient continued to be negative about 1 liter with
IV lasix, though she continued to require 4 liters of oxygen.
Her cranial nerve deficits continued to improve. She was
reevaluated by speech and swallow who recommended starting a
modified diet.

On [**8-8**], she had continued hypoxia and medicine was consulted. A
CTA Chest revealed no PE and ekg was normal. Electrolytes were
repleted and blood pressure controlled. A Echo showed no heart
failure or valvular abormalities.

On [**8-9**], oxygen was weaned and patient was oxygenating 97-98% on
room air. Pain was controlled with oral medications. The patient
did not have any nausea. The incision was clean, dry and intact
with non-absorbable sutures. Two staples were removed from the R
forehead. The patient was advised to follow up in [**2-21**] days for
wound check and to have sutures removed. the patient was
discharged on amlodipine for continued high blood pressure
readings. The patient was advised to follow up with PCP for
blood pressure re-check once out of the hospital to evaluate the
ongoing need. The chronic indwelling foley catheter was left in
place with plan to change per regular schedule by home nursing.
Oral Keflex was restarted for prophylaxis. The patient continued
to have the neurologic deficits as described above. All plans
and instructions were clearly related to patient and husband at
bedside. All questions were answered and the patient expressed
readiness for discharge.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent
pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and
recurrent aspiration.  He was admitted on [**5-15**] to the MICU for
hypoxemia and hypotension.
.
Per previous notes, he has a history of recurrent aspiration
pneumonias of unclear etiology - he has a G tube in place
through which he gets tube feeds nightly. He does not take any
PO feeds currently. His history is significant for esophageal
dysmotility of unclear etiology; furthermore, he carries a
diagnosis of Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] vasculitis and multiple sclerosis. He
also has COPD and is on 2 L of oxygen at home that he uses
inconsistently. In the past, he also had a pulmonary embolus for
which an IVC filter was placed.
.
His prior history of his recurrent pneumonia is as follows,
taken from hospital records: in early spring of [**2169**], the
patient was well enough to have a vacation in the [**Country 13622**]
Republic, swimming, etc. Over the past 16 months, however the
patient has had multiple bouts of pneumonia that number 15-20.
He first presented in the spring of [**2169**] with cough, shortness
of breath, yellow thick sputum, chest tightness, weakness and
wheezing. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with a
presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia and improved, only to have a
relapse of symptoms within days to week or so. This happened
several times in the spring of [**2169**] and by mid spring of last
year, he was noted to have high levels of peripheral eosinophils
as well as eos in his sputum (BAL [**7-/2169**]), and the patient was
treated for worms given his exposure abroad.  In the summer of
[**2170**], given gastroesophageal reflux disease and significant
esophageal dysmotility, potentially leading to his recurrent
pneumonias, a decision was made to place a G-tube, through which
he now gets his tube feeds and medications. Several motility and
EGD studies have not revealed a clear cause for his dysmotility.
 Recently he was hospitalized for an aspiration event and was
treated with levofloxacin
.
Currently he lives at [**Hospital3 2558**], where he has been in
rehabilitation over the past 1 year. On the day of admission, he
developed a fever to 101; the night prior he said he felt short
of breath after his evening tube feed. He says his aspiration
events occur at night, after he lays down, following his G tube
feedings.
.
In the ED, his systolic blood pressure fell to 89; he had 2 L of
fluid given with improvement in his pressure to 100 systolic. He
was placed initially on a nonrebreather which was quickly weaned
to a venti-mask, his saturations in the low 90s. Chest x-ray was
obtained showing bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that remain
unchanged from prior chest x-ray and likely are secondary to his
underlying eosinophilic process.
.
In the MICU, the patient was stabilized with fluids, supportive
oxygen supplementation, and vancomycin + zosyn for coverage of
HCAP. His outpatient pulmonologist was consulted and the
suspician was for aspiration pneumonia related to tube feeds as
a precipitation for this acute presentation.  The plan was for
48 hours of IV antibiotics, with conversion to PO if tolerated
for an additional 5 day course.  The patient has a history of
chronic lower back pain on morphine, however this was held out
of concern for respiratory failure. Nutrition was consulted for
help to minimize aspiration events.
.
On the floor, patient is without complaint. His back pain has
returned, and he would like morphine. He feels his breathing has
improved since admission. he is still coughing, productive of
some sputum. Denies f/c/s, shortness of breath.  He also notes
some chronic b/l lower leg pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD,
recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple
sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration, admitted to MICU [**5-15**] and
treated for aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Cough/Fever: Given his history, the most likely etiology was
aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, as time course and
presentation fits with this.  He was initially treated with IV
antibiotics, and subsequently transitioned to a course of PO
augmentin, on which he improved. He was also given nebulizer
treatments.
.
# Chronic lung disease: Patient has suspected Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], for
which he is on a prednisone taper, and azathioprine.  He was
continued on his original Prednisone taper set forth prior to
this admission by his outpatient Pulmonologist. He also
continued on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He also has OSA, and
CPAP was continued.
.
# Weight loss, eosinophila:  [**Month (only) 116**] be explained by Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**],
however there is a concern for potential underlying malignancy.
The patient will follow-up with his outpatient pulmonologist,
who will consider referral to hematology oncology. This was
discussed with the pulmonologist and patient.
.
# Bipolar disease - continued quetiapine and citalopram
.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued pravastatin
.
# Back pain, leg pain - continued gabapentin, morphine, fentanyl

.
# Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine
.
# Multiple sclerosis - continued immunosuppression as above
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-consider heme/onc referral for weight loss, persistent
peripheral eosinophilia
-consdier tube feeding during the waking hours (or as much
during day hours as possible) to prevent aspiration (which
typically occurs at night)

[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], COPD and MS presented to the ED with CP and SOB x 1
day. Of note, has had 4 admissions in the last 2 months, most
recently [**Date range (1) 107262**] for CP and SOB. His prednisone was
increased and he was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**].
.
On arrival to the ED, vital signs were T 101.9, HR 104, BP
134/59, RR 24, 86% on 10L. Sat remained < 90% on NRB. Pt
endorsed that his Sx were similar to prior flares but worse. He
c/o left-sided CP, but no radiation, nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis. No Hx of cardiac interventions, but pt does states
that he has nitro at home to use PRN chest pain. He was put on
BiPAP in the ED. No subjective improvement, but pt's sat did
improve. Prior to transfer, he was put back on NRB and was
satting 93%. he got 5mg IV morphine x 1 for CP which didn't
help. He then got SL NTg x 1, which relieved his CP. Of note,
first trop <0.01, no ECG changes. Given concern for new
infiltrates on CXR, he was given cefepime/levo/vanc.

Labs showed WBC 10 but 88% PMNs. Hct at baseline, lactate 1.0.
ABG on BiPAP 7.59/29/82/29.

CXR was conferning for increased infiltrate in the right base
compared to prior.

Pt ws given vancomycin, cefepime, and levoflox for HCAP
coverage. Also given solumedrol, 1L NS, and morphine for pain.

[**2171-6-23**] CXR
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The heart size is
difficult to assess.  Multifocal opacities in the lower lungs
appear more confluent than on the prior study, particularly at
the right lung base.  The significance is uncertain since there
has been opacification in the area suggesting chronic scarring.
However, along the lateral right lung base, a new lateral
component was not clearly present on recent prior radiographs
and may represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting.

IMPRESSION: Patchy lateral right lower lung opacity for which
the possibility of pneumonia superimposed upon existing
atelectasis could be considered in the appropriate setting.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o M with h/o MS, G-tube for recurrent h/o aspiration PNA,
severe COPD, possible churg-[**Last Name (un) **]/eosinophilic pneumonia and
multiple recent admissions for SOB who presents from [**Hospital 7137**] with SOB and CP requiring BiPAP in the ED.
.
# Hypoxia/Aspiration Pneumonia - Pt was initially admitted to
the ICU due to BIPAP requirement, yet he did not need that by
the time he arrived.  He was placed on nasal cannula initially
at 4L and titrated down.  His symptoms and findings are most
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  He was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics and will continue HCAP coverage to complete
7 days. Pt has remained afebrile and improving clinically with
decreased oxygen requirement.
- PICC was placed to complete 7 days of IV antibiotics with
Zosyn for aspiration/hospital acquired pneumonia
-cont incentive spirometer, oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
and titrate as possible, at baseline uses 2L occasionally
-cont standing nebs, and prednisone for COPD/Churg [**Last Name (LF) 3532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
complete 5 days of prednisone 60mg then back to 10mg
- Bcx remain negative at time of discharge
- aspiration precautions as possible
- Recommend PT for pulmonary toilet
.
# Hypotension: resolved, was asymptomatic, and given 1L NS on
[**2171-6-25**].  He runs at low BPs at baseline.
.
# Back pain: stable on home morphine and fentanyl patch
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 25 mcg qday
.
# OSA:  will have repeat sleep study in [**Month (only) 205**] to reassess
.
# Esophageal dysmotility: Continue Reglan 5 mg QID

# HLD: on pravastatin
.
# Depression: continue celexa 30 mg qday
.
# Bipolar d/o: continue quetiapine 12.5 mg hs prn, trazodone 50
mg

# Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 107263**] (partner, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107261**])

# Code: Pt wants intubation per discussions in ED. However, pt
is known to palliative care and their notes document DNR but OK
to intubate. He was seen by them here and they will continue to
follow whenever he gets admitted

History of Present Illness:
40 yo F with h/o obesity, obstructive v central sleep apnea, and
tracheomalacia requiring tracheostomy.  She was admitted to
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical on [**9-1**] with LE cellulitis and treated with IV
vancomycin and cefepime for 5 days and switched to PO Keflex. On
[**9-3**], her trach was changed out but she became apneic,
unresponsive, and hypoxic, with desaturation to the 30s. She was
given narcan without significant changes. A head CT was normal.
She was bagmask ventilated with improvement of her saturations
to 100%. She was placed on a vent transiently, but subsequently
weaned back to trach collar. On [**9-7**], the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy that showed severe tracheobroncheomalacia with
80-90% collapse. The patient is transfered here for
Interventional Pulmonary evaluation and possible treatment for
her TBM.
.
Of note, at night, her trach is capped, and she wears oronasal
adaptive servo ventilation with O2 bled in.  She has significant
baseline dyspnea with exertion and central apneic spells. She is
reported to be comfortable at rest without dyspnea or hypoxia,
or hemodynamic instability. On the floor, the patient is stable
and comfortable. She notes that her lower extremity cellulitis
has much improved. Her breathing is stable and she is not
hypoxic, nor dyspnic while speaking. She states that her apneic
episodes are initiated by coughing spasms.

[**9-20**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction
which is
etiologically non-specific. None of the patient's typical
episodes of
confusion were recorded during the study. No epileptiform
discharges or
electrographic seizures are present.
.
[**9-22**] 24 hour EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of mild diffuse background slowing. These findings are
indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
There was one pushbutton event for unclear reasons, and the EEG
around
this time shows no change from baseline. There were no
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures. Compared to the prior
day's
recording, there is no significant change.
.
[**9-22**] Renal US
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 14.4 cm and the left kidney
measures 13.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. No cyst or stone
or solid mass is seen in either kidney. No perinephric fluid
collection is identified. The bladder is collapsed on a Foley
catheter.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable renal ultrasound.
.
[**9-23**] MRI brain
FINDINGS:
There are scattered areas of periventricular and subcortical
white matter
signal abnormality identified, which are nonspecific, though
likely related to the patient's known history of multiple
sclerosis. There is no associated T1 signal abnormality.
Otherwise, the brain parenchyma is normal in signal intensity.
There is no
signal abnormality identified within the brainstem. There is no
evidence of hemorrhage. There is no parenchymal edema, mass
lesion, or mass effect.  There is no focus of abnormal
susceptibility to suggest the presence of blood products, and
there is no area of slow diffusion to suggest acute or subacute
infarct.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There
is no shift of midline structures or effacement of the basal
cisterns.
The globes, orbits, and extracranial soft tissues are normal.
Paranasal
sinuses and mastoids are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. White matter T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities, in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter, which are by imaging nonspecific,
given the
clinical history of multiple sclerosis, likely reflect MS
plaques.
2. No acute intracranial process identified, including no
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarct. No explanation for
""unresponsiveness"".
.
[**9-20**] Bronchoscopy: The flexible bronchoscope was advanced
through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared mildly erythematous.
The proximal tracheal mucosa was edematous and mildly
erythematous. The tracheostomy tube was approximately 3cm from
the vocal cords. The #6 Portex cuffed tracheostomy tube was
partially retracted to allow for passage of the scope to distal
airways. Minimal granulation tissue was noted at the edge of the
stoma. A prominent posterior membrane was present in the
trachea. Left and right lungs to the segmental level were patent
without lesions.
.
other findings:	Dynamic maneuvers were performed with the
following findings: trachea proximal to stoma - unable to assess
malacia due to edema; trachea distal to stoma - no collapse; LMS
- no collapse; RMS - severe 100% collapse; [**Hospital1 **] - mild collapse.
The scope was then removed and the procedure completed.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 40 yo F with PMH significant for central apnea/obesity
hypoventilation syndrome, MS, tracheomalacia, respiratory
distress s/p tracheostomy, DM2, hypothyroid, and
depression/anxiety who was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of her tracheomalacia and recurrent episodes of LOC.

ACTIVE ISSUE
# Unresponsiveness: During this hospitalization, the pt had
multiple episodes of LOC witnessed by hospital staff, lasting
from 1 min to 15 mins. Her unresponsive episodes were always
self-limited with stable VS during the interim. It is not
exactly clear the underlying etiology of her recurrent
unresponsiveness. The current working diagnosis is between
unusually high sleeping drive vs pseudoseizure.  During the
first episode, a code blue was called and she was transferred to
the MICU.  It was notable that pt maintained normal HR, BP, and
O2 sats throughout these episodes.  There had been several
episodes that pt was reported to have bilateral LE tremor.
Neurology was consulted.  CT head showed no evidence of acute
bleed.  24 hour EEG monitoring was performed, which did not show
evidence of epileptic wave form during those unresponsive
episodes.  There was also no evidence of narcolepsy or cataplexy
given the lack of transition between awake wave to REM sleep
wave.  Inpatient sleep study was performed with patient using
trach mask at 40% FiO2 showed moderate sleep apnea, central >
obstructive process.  Of note, pt remained stable vital signs
with good oxygen saturation throughout the night.   Pt is
recommended to sleep with trach mask at 40% FiO2 per our sleep
team after conducting and reviewing the sleep studies.  We
started her on Provigil in the AM, which could be uptitrated as
tolerated. So far patient did very well since the initiation of
this medication, and has not had any unresponsive episodes.

# Tracheomalacia: Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concerns of
tracheomalacia identified on bronchoscopy at OSH.  The patient
was seen by our interventional pulmonologists for workup of her
frequent apneic spells associated with coughing spasms. The
patient had PFT testing, a CT trachea/bronchial protocol, and a
bronchoscopy. The bronchoscopy showed 100% collapse of the RMS
of the right lobe. The other segments of the lungs did not
collapse. The study also showed erythema and edema of the
subglottis suggestive of laryngeal reflux. There is no evidence
of air way collapse on CT trachea/bronchial protocol. Because of
these findings, the pulmonologists did not feel that stenting of
the RMS would provide improvement of her apnea. Pt is a poor
surgical candidate given her medical comordities, which makes
stenting not desirable as it is often a temporary intervention.
Currently we recommend optimzing her management of GERD and
asthma, which are the likely underlying cause for her cough.

# Leukocytosis: The patient developed a low grade fever and
leukocytosis (WBC 22.9) on HD#2.  Blood, urine, and sputum cx
were sent and she was started on vanc/zosyn.  Sputum cx grew
MRSA, and zosyn was discontinued.  Her leukocytosis quickly
resolved, by #HD4 was wnl, suggesting it may have been
post-procedural.  However given the e/o MRSA in her sputum she
completed 5 day course of IV vancomycin.

# Acute renal faliure: On HD#4 pt had acute rise in creatinine
from 0.8 to 1.5.  Her creatinine continued to rise to 3.0 and
then stabilized.  Fractional excretion of Na was <1%, however
her creatinine did not improve with IV fluids.  Labs showed no
peripheral or urine eos to suggest AIN, and renal U/S ruled out
obstruction.  Renal service was consulted and observed muddy
brown casts in urine, suggesting ATN.  Pt is maintaining good
urine output, however, her creatinine has not returned to her
baseline at the time of discharge.  She should continue
supportive care (avoid diuretics or nephrotoxic agents, trend
creatinine) and follow up with her PCP to ensure resolution of
her creatinine.

# Conjunctival hemorrhage: Pt was noted to have bilateral
conjunctiva hemorrhage and periocular lesion during this
admission.  Pt was seen by opthalmology.  The nature of the
lesion was thought to be traumatic.  Upon discharge, clearance
of her hemorrhage has been noticed.

# Meralgia Paresthetica: Pt c/o numbness and burning sharp pain
on lateral aspects of right thigh.  The presentation was
consistent with meralgia parathetica, especially given her body
habitus and long time on the bed.  We discontinued morphine and
started her on gabepentin 300 [**Hospital1 **].  Please uptitrate as needed.

# Anemia: Microcytic anemia with Hct in mid 20s.  Per pt, pt had
long history of iron deficiency anemia.  Per patient, she could
not absorb po iron.  In the past, she had received iv iron via
portcath, which was placed 3 years ago.  Her last treatment
according to her was 6 months ago.  Workup is notable for mild
iron deficiency with normal ferritin.  There is no clinical
evidence of bleeding.  Her lead level was also normal.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Multiple sclerosis: Pt has a documented history of MS.  She
underwent a non-contrast MRI which showed white matter T2/FLAIR
abnormalities in the periventricular white matter which likely
reflect old MS plaques.  Pt had a baclofen pump, which runs at
1148.4mcg/day.  The pump has been followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1356**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 91297**]).

# Retinitis Pigmentosa: Pt has documented history of retinitis
pigmentosa.  She was evaluated by ophthalmology during this
admission.  Her central vision was 20/30 bilaterally.  However,
her peripheral vision was signficantly compromised bilaterally.


# DM2: The patient has documented history of type 2 DM.  She was
treated with home dose glargine and sliding scale short acting
insulin.

# Hypothyroidism: we continued levothyroxin 200 mg daily.

#. LE cellulitis: Resolved. LE with stasis dermatitis changes
but no concern for reinfection.

#. Depression: The patient was continued on her Paxil and
Abilify.  We discontinued clonazepem given the risk of
respiratory depression.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],
.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had increased
episodes where you became unresponsive during the day and
sometimes stopped breathing associated with coughing spasms. Our
pulmonary colleagues performed a bronchoscopy that showed some
collapse of a small part of the lung, but nothing that requires
stenting or surgical repair.  They recommended optimizing
treatment for your acid reflux and asthma.  You were also found
to have multiple episodes of unresponsiveness.  We don't have a
good explanation for these episodes, but we don't think they are
seizures, or complications from your multiple sclerosis.  You
also underwent sleep study, and our sleep specialist felt that
sleep with trach mask is the best option at this time, and there
is no need to use BiPAP.  We felt that right now are you stable
and can go to an extended care facility for continued care.
.
Please note that the following medication has been changed:
- Please START to take Modafinil 100 mg tablet by mouth in AM
daily
- Please START to take Gabapentin 300 mg capsule by mouth every
12 hours
- Please START to take ferrous sulfate 300 mg tablet by mouth
daily
- Please START to take Pantoprazole 40 mg tablets by mouth twice
a day
- Please START to apply miconazole powder to groin area twice a
day
- Please START to apply Camphor-menthol lotion to dry skin as
needed daily
- Please STOP clonazepam as it may cause problems with your
somnolence
- There is otherwise no change to your previous medication list.
.
It has been a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**].  We
wish you a speedy recovery.
.
NOTE: PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FOLEY IS REMOVED UPON ARRIVAL
OF THE EXTENDED CARE FACILITY

Followup Instructions:
Please make sure that you have follow up appointments with your
previous neurologist, ophthalmologist, and sleep specialist
after returning to [**State 1727**].

EKG: sinus tach at 115bpm, NA/NI, poor R wave progression.

Imaging:
[**10-20**] CT head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology

[**10-21**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This EEG telemetry did not capture any
pushbutton events for seizures. It was a 3.5 hour extended
routine study. There was
present two relatively short duration periods of what appeared
to be
perhaps slow wave sleep activity. It could not be determined
based upon
patient's clinical state since she appeared to lie relatively
motionless
throughout the entire record. The impression essentially is that
this
is a normal awake and breakthrough sleep study. No clear
epileptic
activity was identified.

[**10-22**] AP CXR: The nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Previous pulmonary edema has
largely cleared. Greater opacification at the right lung base
could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Right internal jugular
infusion port ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pleural

Brief Hospital Course:
40 y.o woman with history of multiple sclerosis, central and
obstructive sleep apnea who is now post-op s/p T-tube placement.
.
#Trach-tube placement - the patient underwent placement of a
Hebeler T-tube for evidence of tracheal collapse above her
previous tracheostomy tube.  The procedure was without
complication, and the patient was kept overnight for
observation.  Care for the tube should include [**Hospital1 **] saline
flushing with 5mL and suctioning.  Cap during the day and uncap
during the night with humidified trach mask.  The patient was
also started on mucinex for mucous control.
[**10-22**] the patient had a rigid bronchoscopy by IP that showed
severe inflammation. During the procedure the patient had mucous
plugging resulting in severe hypoxia. Afterwards she was treated
with 4 days of Solumedrol 40mg Q4hrs and 5 days of Vanc/Zosyn to
try to reduce the swelling. She was kept in the ICU in case of
repeat plugging episode. On [**10-26**] her T-tube was replaced with
#7 uncuffed. Patient tolerated procedure well. She was restarted
on regular diet after the procedure.

# Unresponsiveness episodes: Early AM of [**10-20**], the patient
became unresponsive during an albuterol nebulizer treatment.
Code blue was called, however she was never pulseless or apneic.
Her vital signs were stable and she did not get chest
compressions. ABG showed hypercarbia with pCO2 70, however this
was not high enough to explain her symptoms, given her baseline
in the 50s and 60s. Head CT negative. EEG showed no seizure
activity. Her mental status exam slowly improved over the next
two to three days to the point the patient was at baseline.
Initially she complained of being unable to move her body except
for blinking, followed by inability to move the left side of her
body. Neurology was consult, who felt that that her neurology
exam was inconsistent, and this was likely caused by a
conversion disorder. Psychiatry was consulted, who felt the
patient was at a high risk for a psychiatric event, but that
this was a diagnosis of exclusion. She had one further even the
night of [**10-22**] lasting about 10 minutes, that resolved
spontaneously. She had no further episodes. We held her abilify
given self-reported dizziness, in concert with psychiatry
consult. She will need follow up with psychiatry as outpatient.
.
#. Nutrition: after the bronch [**10-22**] the patient had trouble
swallowing solids. The patient had to be NPO for several days,
so an NG tube was placed and tube feeds were started. She was
seen by speech and swallow after replacement of her tube , who
recommended regular diet.
.
#Diabetes - continued glargine. While on Tube feeds the patient
was covered with regular insulin Q6hrs.
.
#Depression - continued paroxetine, aripiprazole.
.
#Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine at 200mcg/day.
.
#[**Last Name (un) **] - creatinine trending down from prior admission. This
normalized to 0.9 prior to discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient will need psychiatry follow up as outpatient. We held
her aripiprazole given episodes of unresponsiveness and self
reported dizziness.
- Patient will need her baclofen [**Last Name (un) 4581**] refilled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year-old female with history of AAA, HTN, HLD, ESRD on
dialysis, SLE, questionable dx Multiple Sclerosis 40 years ago
at [**Hospital1 112**] dx by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2617**], neuropathy, Neurogenic Bladder, chrnic
fecal incontinence, ESRD on HD presented initially with left
chest pain and later was noted to have dense paraparesis in teh
legs. Per further discussion with the patient, she had been
hypotensive on HD on [**10-10**] to 70s (has baseline hypotension) and
had problems moving her legs initially and then at 3pm on [**10-10**]
had not been able to move her legs. She has been bedbound
following a leg fracture. She had been on warfarin DVT
prophylaxis that was stopped [**10-8**] due to problems with bruising
and epistaxis. On examination at [**Hospital1 18**] patent had a flaccid
paraparesis and only able to just wiggle her toes bilaterally,
sensory level to T8 anteriorly to pain/temp and T12/L1
posteriorly. Reflexes were absent in the legs and proprioception
was decreased to the ankle on left and the knee on right.
Patient had a SBP 70s in the ED but was mentating well A+Ox3.

CTA abdomen [**10-11**] revealed a stable large infrarenal AAA
measuring 7.2 x 7.7 x 9.3 cm of which a large portion was
thrombosed with no rupture or signs of impending rupture.
Vascular Surgery had consulted regarding possible vascular cause
for her weakness. Vascular Surgery did not find evidence of
aortic dissection or impending aortic rupture. CTA legs showed
extensive atherosclerotic plaque throughout the LE vasculature
and bilateral popliteal aneurysms R>L. There was occlusion of
the anterior tibial arteries at the origin on the right and at
the mid calf on the left. Patient refused any surgical or
endovascular intervention on her infrarenal AAA. MRI whole spine
[**10-11**] revealed a likely compeleted anterior spinal artery
infarct extending from T9 to conus.

Transferred to the neuro ICU for pressors. Patient was started
on aspirin 325mg daily and was treated conservatively. PT/OT
evaluated. On discusion, it was felt that no further imaging was
needed. Renal were consulted and patient was continued on HD.

On exam on [**10-12**], she improved slightly with increased strength
in her toes bilaterally. On [**10-14**] she had mild improvment in
toes and trace movement in quads on left. Her SBP was stable in
the 100- 130's while off pressors. She was transferred to the
floor on [**10-14**].

Her weakness continued to gradually improve during her
admission. On [**10-15**] she had a transient episode of chest
pressure/SOB - EKG and CM's were negative, CXR unchanged. She
had HD later that day and felt that her symptoms improved. Her
blood pressure remained stable from 100's - 130's. Her home
antihypertensives were held throughout her admission. These will
need to be restarted gradually once her blood pressure begins to
rise about 140. **Goal SBP is 100-140.**

Dermatology was consulted regarding acute on chronic itch and
skin changes in
her hands, arms and back. Given a close contact with scabies,
she had already undergone permethrin cream rx. Dermatology
recommended TAC ointment and Sarna lotion topical therapy. She
also received another permethrin cream whole body skin
application prior to discharge.

She was seen by PT/OT who recommended rehab placement upon
discharge.

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
Patient will need close blood pressure monitoring. All of her
home BP medications (Toprol XL 100mg Daily, Lisinopril 10mg PO
Daily, Imdur 30mg QHS, Norvasc 10mg Daily) have been held during
her hospitalization. Her goal SBP is 100-140. Her
antihypertensives may be gradually restarted if her BP begins to
rise above 140. Caution must be taken during dialysis to avoid
hypotension.
Patient will need intensive PT/OT for her severe lower extremity
weakness.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**],
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2137-10-11**] for weakness in your legs. You were found to
have a blood clot in your spinal cord which is likely causing
your weakness. This may have been related to an episode of low
blood pressure during dialysis. Your weakness has improved
somewhat during your admission but you will need intensive
rehabilitation in order to regain your strength. You should
continue with your previous schedule of dialysis with close
attention to your blood pressure to avoid it dropping too low
again.

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with history of ESRD on hemodialysis, IDDM,
htn, hyperlipidemia, peripheral arterial disease and bilateral
carotid artery disease (apparently tight right carotid) who was
admitted to [**Location (un) **] on [**7-10**] with worsening dyspnea, chest
fullness, transferred here on [**7-14**], underwent cardiac cath
showing 3VD (no intervention) now with hypotension, neck
stiffness and ST elevations V1-2, positive cardiac enzymes and
hypoglycemia.
.
Patient drove himself to [**Hospital **] Hospital with shortness of
breath, found to have elevated BNP at 2465, Trop 0.09-0.10,
Ck/MB
negative. EKG with new changes: right bundle and septal infarct

pattern. Echo at [**Location (un) **] on [**2121-7-11**] showed EF of 30-35%. He was
transferred here for cardiac cath on [**7-14**] which showed 3VD, no
intervention, but ultimate plan was for CABG. Given his
bilateral carotid disease, it was felt that this should be
further worked up. Carotid u/s showed 60% on right and 40% on
left. Given his dyspnea, orthopnea, he underwent an extra
dialysis run on [**7-15**] to remove additional fluid (2L removed). He
had been dialyzed on [**7-14**].  Referred for CABG.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2121-7-14**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this co-dominant
patient revealed severe native three vessel disease.  The short
LMCA had
diffuse plaquing.  The LAD was a twin system with the more
medial
anterior septum LAD having an ostial 80% and diffuse proximal
80%
disease.  The Ramus was heavily calcified with severe diffuse
disease in
branch vessels.  The LCX was heavily calcified with proximal
diffuse
disesease.  There was mid 50% before OM1 and 70% after OM1.  The
large
OM1 had proximal 50% disease and the distal AV groove LCX had
80%
disease.  The RCA was heavily calcified with proximal diffuse
70-80%
with moderate pressure dampening.  The mid RCA had 90% disease.
There
was no true PDA but multiple vessels seemed to run perpendicular
to the
inferior interventricular septum.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left filling
pressures with a preserved cardiac index.  There was no gradient
across
the mitral or aortic valve.  The systemic blood pressure was
normal and
there as no pulmonary hypertension.
3. LV gram deferred due to contrast load.  Echo at [**Hospital **]
hospital with
EF 35% by report.

===================
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY [**2120-7-15**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular  cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
There is mild-to-moderate global  left ventricular hypokinesis
(ejection fraction 40 percent). Tissue Doppler  imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is  hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular  systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at  the sinus level.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined with certainty.
The aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
systolic doming of the aortic valve  leaflets, suggesting a
bicuspid aortic valve. There is a minimally increased  gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern  suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial  pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe  pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2121-5-15**],  the left ventricular ejection fraction appears
somewhat further reduced. The  aortic valve is probably bicuspid
and displays minimal stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111052**] had EKG changes suggetive of global ischemia with
multiple ectopic foci. Patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on [**2120-7-14**] that showed diffuse 3 vessel disease not amenable to
PCI. He was evaluated by cardiac surgery for CABG. On the
morning of [**2120-7-16**], the patient began to note neck pain and was
given 5mg of oxycodone. Shortly thereafter, he had hypotension
with BP 64/40, improving only to SBP of 80 with 500cc NS bolus.
Of note, he had dialysis the evening prior for volume overload.
EKG revealed new ST elevation in V1 and downward sloping ST
segment changes in V3-V6. He was started on dopamine at 5
mcg/kg/min on the floor and transferred to the CCU.
.
2. CHF - Pump Failure:
Patient had an echocardiogram that showed new LV dysfunction
since [**2121-5-15**], with a drop in EF from 50% to 40% with global LV
hypokinesis, with elevated RSVP. The patient developed an
elevation in CK from 36->252 the day after cath, which was
considered to be strain from volume overload, as it was not
accompanied by new EKG changes.
.
On [**2121-7-16**], after being transferred to the CCU for hypotension
requiring vasopressor support, he was *** sent to the cath lab
for insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump.
.
3. ESRD on HD
Dialysis schedule qMWF, but underwent additional session on
[**2121-7-15**] for volume overload, where 2L was removed by report.
.
4. DM-Hypoglycemia
Patient's regular insulin 75/25 was continued. The evening of
[**2121-7-15**], pt reported not eating as much. While hypotensive on the
morning of [**2121-7-16**], he was also hypoglycemic with at least two
fingersticks less than 40. He was given 1 amp of D50, and
increased his BS but then dropped back below 40, when he was
given another amp of D50.
.
5. Thrombocytopenia

On [**7-16**], taken to the OR and underwent emergency CABG x4 with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. IABP removed in the OR due to known aortic disease.
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine,
levophed and milrinone drips. Extubated the next afternoon and
drips slowly weaned off.Renal service continued to follow him
throughout his stay for continued HD. Chest tubes removed on POD
#2 and transferred to the floor to begin increasing his activity
level. Pacing wires removed on POD #3.Beta blockade  titrated
over the next few days. He had his routine dialysis treatment on
Monday, [**2121-7-21**], and tolerated it well.  He is ready to be
discharged to rehab to progress with physical therapy and
increasing his mobility.

Chief Complaint:
hypotension, seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is an 81 yo woman with history of multiple
sclerosis, dementia and seizure disorder who initially presented
to the E.D after a ""usual seizure."" Patient is unable to give
history. History obtained from ED notes, OMR notes, and
discussion with family members/care givers. The patient was
initially reported to have suffered a seizure this morning,
witnessed, occurred while in bed. Was typical seizure for her:
consists of back arching, groaning and eyelid fluttering,
shaking her head, lasting 1-2 minutes. This was followed by a
period of ""less responsiveness"" although the patient is
reportedly nonverbal and minimally responsive at baseline. She
also bit her lip during the event.
.
In the ED, VS were initially stable. Head CT was negative. Neuro
was consulted and recommended EEG. She underwent EEG, which
revealed ongoing seizure activity. She was given ativan 2mg IV
with resolution of seizure activity. On return to the ED from
EEG lab, she was noted to have SBP in the 50s. She was also
found to have no gag reflex, so she was intubated for airway
protection. She was given 4L of NS and started on dopamine via
peripheral line with improvement of SBP to 100s. She was given
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl empirically in the ED. Prior
to transfer to the ICU, she was noted to be more hypothermic and
the ED was concerned for sepsis. The patient had a CXR performed
that revealed some evidence of congestion as well as bilateral
lower lobe opacities concerning for atelectasis vs. PNA. THe
patient's UA on admission had mod bacteria, [**3-29**] WBC, Nit
negative, LE negative.
.
Discussion with the patient's family caretaker reveals that the
patient has been treated for 3 days with Ciproflox 250 [**Hospital1 **] for a
UTI but otherwise had been in her usual state of health. The
patient does however have by report a history of recurrent UTI
as well an kidney stone.

Ext: Trace LE edema, DP trace bilaterally. LE cool but not cold.

Neuro: Patient does not follow commands reliably. Oculocephalic
reflex intact. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally in UE, 1+ in lower


Pertinent Results:
CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Moderate brain atrophy.
.
Repeat CT Head: Limited examination with no gross acute
intracranial process or significant change since the study
obtained 10 hours earlier.
.
CXR: Bilateral low lung field opacities which could represent
atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
.
Repeat CXR: Single AP view of the chest supine is obtained on
[**2172-12-4**] at 12:45 hours and compared with the prior radiograph
performed approximately six hours previously. The patient has
been intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 4.5 cm
above the carina. The remainder of the examination is
essentially unchanged with likely bilateral pleural effusions.
Increased density is seen in both lower lung fields, which may
indicate some superimposed airspace disease is most marked on
the left side.
Bony structures show diffuse osteopenia. Again is seen deformity
of the proximal portion of the right humerus. A fracture cannot
be excluded on this single image. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
.
Pelvis Xray: No acute fracture is identified. Again noted are
bilateral hip prostheses, which are unchanged in conformation
and appear intact. The distal portions of the devices are not
visualized. Callus formation is noted around the right proximal
femur. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine and left
hip are observed. Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 y.o. F with MS, seizure d/o, who presented with status
epilepticus, found to be subsequently hypotensive with a
pneumonia and requiring intubation for airway protectin.
.
#. Hypotension - Initial events were ill defined.  Initial
differential dx included sepsis, hypercarbia, hypovolemia.
Patient was given aggressive fluid volume resuscitation and was
was placed on broad antibiotic coverage.  She also initially
required Levophed for blood pressure support.  There was no
evidence of acute bleeding or measurable cardiac shock
component.  She also underwent a cortisol stim test which was
negative for adrenal insufficiency.  Patient had a central
venous line placed to monitor her central venous pressure to a
goal of at least 8.  She was broadly pancultured but the cultres
failed to reveal a source.  CXR did show a small left
retrocardiac opacity that could be interpreted as a pneumonia.
She was subsequently treated with 7 days of Vancomycin and
Zosyn.  Patient remained normotensive on [**12-10**] for last 5 days
without pressors and was transfered to the floor after her
arterial line was discontinued.  For the remainder of her
hospital stay she maintained stable blood pressure.
.
# Respiratory Failure - Patient was initially intubated for
airway protection after the post-ictal state.  She was found to
have a left retrocardiac opacity and was subsequently treated
with Vancomycin and Zosyn as described above.  Patient was also
found to have marked volume overload after the aggressive volume
overload.  She improved greatly with diuresis and continued to
autodiurese without diuretics.  Patient initially had a very
weak cough with moderate secretions.  The cough reflex improved
as the sedation was weaned and the secretions continue to be
well tolerated as patient was extubated.  She was transfered to
regular floor from intensive care unit with oxygen saturations
of 97+% and pAo2 >75.  She maintained her oxygenation on room
air for the duration of her hospital stay.
.
#. Seizure - Patient has a long history of refractory seizures
despite therapeutic Dilantin levels. Patient was previously
tried on Keppra by her outpatient neurologist.  She was
monitored in the ICU for non-convulvise status epilepticus.  The
seizure was broken with lorazepam.  There was no evidence of
recurrent seizures.  The likely trigger was an infection such as
the urinary tract infection and the pneumonia.  Initially her
dilantin level was targeted to the 20-25 range.  As she
exhibited no signs of recurrence, her target range  (corrected)
should be [**11-8**].  She will need to follow-up with her primary
neurologist.
- EEG negative
- continue Dilantin, dilantin level 13.4(corrected for
hypoalbuminemia) on [**2172-12-20**]
- outpatient neurology follow up
.
#. Hyperglycemia - patient not a known diabetic, maybe secondary
to stress but persistent does suggest underlying diabetes
mellitus.  There was only mild elevation in her blood sugars
without evidence of a hyper-osmolar state or DKA. She received
insulin sliding scale while in the hospital which was
discontinued on [**2172-12-19**] after several days of normalized
fingersticks
.
#. FEN: Tube Feeds were administered while in the ICU.  Patient
is on modified thicked liquid diet at home;  Patient failed
speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-9**].  She was reassed later
in the hospital stay and was found to be able to take honey
thick liquids.

good. afebrile. stable vitals signs.  tolerating oral nutrition
and medications.


Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated and treated for a recurrence of your
seizures.  This one was particularly long in its duration.  The
likely trigger was a urinary infection and the pneumonia - both
of which have been treated.  The seizure was stopped with ativan
and recurrence was controlled with dilantin.
.
When being fed, you should only receive honey thick liquids and
pureed solids.  As you continue to recover from this illness,
you may be able to advance the consistency of the diet after
talking with your primary doctor.
.
Please take all the medications as they are prescribed.
.
Please make and attend the recommended follow-up appointments.

History of Present Illness:
82F with multiple sclerosis, dementia, seizures, renal calculi
s/p recent lithotripsy and recurrent UTI was being moved from
bed to chair by [**Doctor Last Name **] lift and was noted by care taker to have
convulsive motion in all four extremities. Given ativan 2mg by
EMS with completeresolution and transferred to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.
There she was seen to have additional convulsive movements,
given ativan again with ultimate resolution of symptoms.
However, during the evalution at the OSH she had a SBP as low as
40s. Central access was attempted at bilateral femoral arteries
without success and therfore peripheral dopamine was initiated
with moderate effect. She was found to be hypothermic at 93.0
with a pH of 7.17. She was given ceftriaxone 2gm imperically. CT
head at OSH was normal. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Of
note the patient was pn ciprofloxacin s/p lithotripsy presumably
for renal stones.
.
In the ED her vital signs were T 92 rectally, HR 84 BP 105/34
RR13 she was 80mg of hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency
and on chronic prednisone recently titrated down to 5mg PO
daily. In addition she was given 600mg of linezolid given her
history of UTIs only responsive to this antibiotic. The patient
was intubated and a right subclavian central line was placed.
7mg of versed was given while the patient was taken to the CT
scanner for a head and torso CT.
.
Seen by Neuro in the ED - suggesting EEG, repeat head CT,
restarting home dose antiepileptics and to treat the UTI/closely
control the temperature today.

IMPRESSION: Left retrocardiac opacity is seen, which may
represent an area of consolidation and/or atelectasis. Small
left pleural effusion may also be present.
.
ct chest/abdomen:([**2173-5-23**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.
2. Bilateral renal calculi, without evidence of hydronephrosis
or hydroureter. The largest stone on the right appears similar
in size, but there are several calcific densities within the
right renal pelvis which may represent small fragments from
reported recent lithotripsy. No perinephric fluid collections
are identified.
3. Small 9 mm enhancing focus within the liver, which was not
seen on the prior study, but this may reflect differences in
contrast timing. This is not completely evaluated on this study,
however, the differentials would include a
hemangioma/FNH/adenoma, though a malignancy cannot be entirely
excluded.
.
ct head [**5-23**]:
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No hemorrhage or mass effect is
identified. The ventricles are symmetric, there is no shift of
normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is stable. There is marked enlargement of the
ventricles, which is symmetric, and stable in comparison to
prior study. Soft tissue and osseous structures are within
normal limits.
.
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage is identified. No
interval change from the prior exam from [**2173-1-9**].

.
[**5-23**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the frequent
electrographic
seizures with origin in the left hemisphere, left hemisphere
slowing, a
slow and disorganized background and infrequent suppressed
background
activitiy. The first abnormality suggests frequent
electrographic
seizures with origin in the left hemisphere with secondary
generalization. The left hemisphere slowing suggests
corresponding
subcortical dysfunction. The last two abnormalities suggest a
severe
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic
metabolic
abnormalities or medication effect.
.
[**5-24**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry demonstrated many
electrographic seizures characterized by rhythmic 1-1.5 Hz
spikes and
sharp waves seen with a widespread distribution bilaterally
although
sometimes with a left hemisphere emphasis. It was not clear
whether
there was any clinical correlate to these electrographic
seizures. At
other times, frequent widespread epileptiform discharges were
seen in a
more isolated or non-rhythmic manner. The background was slow
and
disorganized throughout the recording suggestive of a moderate
encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old woman with advanced multiple
sclerosis, dementia, seizures, renal stones, and recurrent UTI
who presented after two seizure episodes.
.
1) Seizure -
The patient has presented several times in the past with
seizures in the setting of urinary tract infections. In [**11-30**]
the patient presented in non-convulsive status epilepticus that
was felt to be triggered by a UTI. In [**12-30**] the patient again
presented with a seizure and a UTI but this time the seizure was
felt to be triggered by hyponatremia. On admission the patient
was therapeutic on dilantin. Based on neurology consultation
recommendations her lamotrigine was increased by 50mg each weak
to achieve goal of 200mg [**Hospital1 **]. As an outpatient her dilantin can
be decreased by 100 q week. It should be noted that repeat
Dilantin levels should be checked every 3 days, and adjusted
accordingly while the patient is taking ciprofloxacin.
.
2) Hypotension -
Etiology of acute decompensation was likely sepsis in the
setting of elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation, no elevation
of cardiac enzymes, unchanged EKG and recurrent UTI. Required
low dose IV dopamine, than changed to levophed for improved
predictability and greater inotropic effect. Weaned to off. Pt
was placed on high dose steroids on admission given chronic
prednisone of 5mg daily. She was tapered back to prednisone 5mg
daily.
.
3) Infection -
WBC from 7.5 to 13.7 over 5 hours. Grossly positive UA. Patient
had very stiff neck on physical exam in the ED prior to
intubation. However this was unlikely meningitis as lumbar tap
performed in the MICU revealed only 3 WBC and gram stain was
negative
She was given Linezolid for history of VRE UTI and Ceftriaxone
for gram negative coverage.  Urine, blood, CSF, and sputum
cultures were all negative. Given negative cultures, she was
changed to linezolid and ciprofloxacin to complete a 14 day
course.
- three days prior to discharge the patient developed a slight
leucocytosis to 13.3 and temp 100.1. Blood cultures, and chest
x-ray were repeated without evidence of infection. UA was
grossly contaminated- Urine cultures did not reveal any growth.
.
4) Respiratory failure:
Patient was intubated for airway protection, and did well with
extubation on [**5-25**].
.
5[**Last Name (STitle) **]istory of Nephrolithiasis-
The patient has history of nephrolithiasis s/p lithotripsy. On
admission the patient was without evidence for obstruction by
CT. She should follow up with her urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient should clinical suspicion dictate further evaluation.
.
5) FEN:
Tube feeds, speech and swallow evaluation x2 revealed failure of
pt to adequately protect her airway while swallowing. She should
remain NPO. Her NG tube needs to be pulled to prevent erosion as
soon as she is re-evaluated by speech and swallow at rehab.

Chief Complaint:
Severe Thunderclap Headache found on imaging to be
intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy placement
PEG Tube placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83553**] is an 82 year old right handed woman with a past
medical history significant for Multiple Sclerosis, Diabetes,
Hypertension, previous stroke, and
legal blindness who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after having been found to
have sudden onset of worst headache of her life, which on
subsequent imaging was found to be a large right parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with subarachnoid hemorrhage at OSH.
She had been in her usual state of health until the day prior to
admission.  On [**2138-6-27**], the patient began to complain about a
severe headache which is frontal and radiates towards the top of
her head.  Initially she attempted to sleep for amelioration,
but at 0400hrs on [**2138-6-28**], the headache recurred, waking her
from sleep.  Per her husband she [**Name2 (NI) 63582**]'t herself,  and had
urinary incontinence. She took an oxycodone which ameliorated
the pain later that morning, but it returned later in the
afternoon.  Upon arrival of her daughter later that evening, she
was found with altered mental status still complaining of severe
headache.  Given this, EMS was activated and the patient was
transported to [**Hospital3 **] for evaluation.  Upon arrival, vitals
were significant for BP of 210/79, HR: 97, RR: 18, T: 98.4 95%
on RA.  There, a NCHCT was performed revealing a right parietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a small subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent
evaluation.

Neurosurgery saw her in the ED, recommending platelets and
Nicardipine for hypertension, but recommended no immediate
surgical intervention and further management per the neurology
service.

Past Medical History:
- Multiple Sclerosis -- diagnosed at age 45 managed by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
apparently been on betaseron in the past (per unsure daughter).
Has baseline right sided weakness and a b/l LE neuropathy, but
is otherwise ambulatory with a walker and has no urinary
incontinence at baseline.
- Hypertension
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on oral hypoglycemics
- Previous stroke unknown location, with no residual deficits
- Legally blind - s/p bilateral laser surgery
- Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Social History:
Lives at home with husband.  Previously worked in a shoe
department repairing shoes.  History of tobacco use, but quit
over 40 years ago.  No Alcohol or Illicit Substances.

EKG [**6-28**]:
Sinus rhythm with borderline first degree A-V conduction delay.
Poor R wave progression.

MRI/A [**6-29**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Limited examination due to patient motion.
Unchanged right parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hematoma with
associated vasogenic edema. Long-term followup is recommended to
identify underlying lesions within the hematoma.
2.  Areas of small vessel disease are noted in the subcortical
white matter.
3.  MRA of the head is limited, however, the major vascular
branches are
patent.  Segmental narrowing is noted in the vessels of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**], suggesting atherosclerotic disease.
4.  No diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute or
subacute
territorial infarction.

CXR [**6-29**]:
FINDINGS:  The NG tube is coiled in the stomach.  There is
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm laterally likely due to a
combination of effusion and volume loss.  An underlying
infiltrate cannot be excluded.  There are no old films available
for comparison.  There is mild pulmonary vascular
redistribution and mild cardiomegaly.

CT head [**6-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New trace intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the
bilateral occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
2. No significant change in the amount of intraparenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. Stable surrounding edema and mild mass effect.

CXR [**6-30**]:
IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and trace left
effusion.

CXR [**7-1**]:
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged pulmonary edema.

CXR [**7-2**]:
IMPRESSION:  Increased moderate asymmetric right greater than
left pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

MRI head [**7-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged appearance of the right parieto-occipital
parenchymal hemorrhage
and its associated mass effect with compression of the occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral venticle.  No evidence of transtentorial or
tonsillar
herniation.
2.  Stable small subarachnoid and intraventricular blood, with
no evidence of
developing hydrocephalus.
3.  Internal blood-fluid layer, and scattered punctate chronic
""microbleeds""
with susceptibility artifact are strongly suggestive of
underlying cerebral
amyloid angiopathy.
4.  New bilateral frontal and right posterior parietal foci of
slow diffusion;
given the ditribution, these are concerning for acute embolic
infarction.
5.  Stable periventricular FLAIR-signal abnormalities are
consistent with
known multiple sclerosis, with possible component of small
vessel ischemic
disease.

**************

TTE [**7-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular global
systolic function is normal. Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is at least borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2138-7-19**]):
      YEAST.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:
82yo RH woman presented with severe headache and was found to
have a right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
subarachnoid component. She was hypertensive to 210 systolic
upon arrival and was started on a nicardipine IV for BP control.
She was admitted to the Neurology ICU for close monitoring with
telemetry and further management.

She was maintained on Q2hour neurochecks and close BP monitoring
with a goal SBP < 160. Nicardipine gtt was titrated off and she
was started on labetalol PRN. MRI/A was performed initially on
[**6-29**] and showed no obvious underlying lesion or vascular
abnormality to explain her hemorrhage. However this study was
limited by motion artifact and no GRE sequence was able to be
completed. A repeat head CT was performed on [**6-30**] which was
essentially unchanged, except for trace intraventricular
hemorrhage layering in the bilateral occipital horns of the
lateral ventricles.

Her exam initially remained stable and essentially nonfocal,
other than some dysarthria and her baseline visual impairment.
She developed intermittent agitation and disorientation and
received a few doses of haldol and ativan IV. Routine EEG showed
slow encephalopathic 5.5 Hz background, no epileptic discharges
or seizures.

On [**7-2**] she was noted to be moving her left side somewhat less
at times. A repeat MRI showed stable R occipital hemorrhage but
new acute infarcts in bilateral frontal and right posterior
parietal regions. There were also scattered punctate lesions of
susceptibility artifact suggestive of amyloid angiopathy.

Over the course of the next two weeks, the patient became more
active and interactive with staff and family.  She remains
globally aphasic, and poorly responds to any commands.  The
patient also experiences occasional epochs of agitation which
are relieved with pain control or Seroquel for agitation.

Cardiopulmonary:
She had a brief respiratory decompensation in the afternoon on
[**6-30**] for which Lasix 20mg IV x 1 was administered with some
initial improvement.  However, renal function subsequently
worsened with decreased UOP and an increase in Cr to 1.7. She
received albumin x 2 followed by additional Lasix.

On [**7-1**], the patient was noted to have difficulty breathing,
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was attempted and
ABGs were obtained which showed poor O2 saturation and worsening
hypercapnea.  CXR obtained was concerning for pulmonary edema.
Pt became bradycardic and sustained a brief cardiopulmonary
arrest for which resuscitation was accomplished with one round
of epi and chest compressions. The patient was intubated and
placed on ventilation for respiratory failure.  EKG showed no
ischemic changes, troponin initially rose to 0.34 but then
downtrended.

Between [**7-5**] and [**7-10**], the patient had episodes of hypertension
which were associated with agitation requiring increased
anti-hypertensive management.  The patient at times was sedated
on propofol for agitation which occurred with any attempts to
wean from sedation.  Blood pressures which ranged in the
systolic range of 140-160 would escalate to the 180s with
sedation weaning attempts.  Her neurologic exam during this
period was remarkable for increasing motion and strength in her
extremities with left remaining greater than right, however
thorough evaluation was not possible [**2-6**] sedation. Initially
Nicardipine gtt was used, but was able to be discontinued in
favor of increased dosages of the patient's home
anti-hypertensive regiment.

Between [**7-12**] and [**7-15**], the patient experienced several episodes
of hypotension requiring a course of fluid boluses and pressors
to maintain adequate perfusion, first with phenylephrine, and
then later with norepinephrine for better pulse management.  Of
note following, [**7-16**] the patient did not require further pressor
use with the exception of a period of hypotension to the 80/60s
with some bradycardia to the 50s on [**7-18**].  Since this time, her
cardiovascular function has been allowed to autoregulate with
only her anti-hypertensive medications continued.  The patient
upon discharge does still have hypertensive swings into the
160-170 systolic blood pressure range which are relieved with
medication or adequate sedation/pain relief.

Renal:
Over the next few days, renal failure persisted with Cr levels
in the 1.7-2.0 range.  Urine/Blood Osmolality and Lytes were
obtained which were consistent with a pre-renal etiology for the
worsening function.  Additional free water flushes were added to
the patients regimen (initially hypotonic lactated ringers were
added as well, but were subsequently discontinued with worsening
hypernatremia).  With this intervention Creatinine improved over
the next week to 1.2.

GI:
On [**7-8**], the decision to perform a tracheostomy and PEG tube was
made which was accomplished on [**7-10**].

Prophylaxis:
Over her ICU course, the patient was maintained on pneumoboots
for DVT prophylaxis. SC heparin was held in the setting of her
bleed but subsequently restarted on [**7-1**]. She was maintained on
a bowel regimen for GI prophylaxis.

[**2174-11-13**] 05:30PM BLOOD Phenyto-20.7*

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 83 yr old female with pmhx significant for longstanding
severe MS, [**Month/Day/Year 37662**], seizure disorder, OSA, HTN, R hand wound
presenting with altered mental status, hypothermia and transient
hypotension. Lengthy discussion in ED and patient had status
initally changed to comfort measures only, and patient was
admitted to the medicine floor.
.
# hypothermia/hypotension/tachypnea/somnolence: Unclear whether
sepsis related to urinary source, pulmonic source, PE, adrenal
insufficiency, worsening OSA with hypercarbia, seizure etiology
but at this time no further work up will take place per family
wishes. In discussion with husband, will administer oxygen for
comfort, pain medications, anti nausea medications and bowel
regimen as needed.  An email has been sent to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2961**]. Palliative care consult and social work consult for
tomorrow. Husband had no further questions.  After the patient
arrived to the floor, a family meeting took place with
escalation of intervention, but did want to continue IV fluids
and antibiotics for a possible pneumonia on CXR.   The family
and caretaker [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] reached consensus and stated they
wanted escalation of care, please see the note by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11835**] of
palliative care for details.  Vitals were monitored, and patient
had no additional episodes of hypothermia or fever.    After
observation in the hospital, she was sent home with hospice.
.
#Hyponatremia: likely SIADH, no further workup or intervention
was pursued.  Pt recieved IV fluids at 50 mL per hour after the
family meeting, until her caregiver began giving her nutrition
PO.
.
#Seizure:  Initally meds were held given CMO status, but after
family meeting, was started on IV dilantin, as patient was not
alert enough to take PO.  As patient began eating, dilantin was
switched over to PO and tolerated well.  A dilantin level was
elevated at 21.3, so the dilantin dosing was decreased to 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.   She was also discharged with Ativan
prn seizure/agitation.
.
#OSA: patient uses CPAP at home, this was not continued intially
for code status.  Oxygen saturations consistently in the 90s
with NC.
.
#FEN: As mentioned above, pt intially had no IV fluids or diet
as she was unarousable and CMO.  After the family meeting,
gentle IVF were started, and these were discontinued after her
caretaker began feeding her PO.  The family had requested that
she not have a speech and swallow evaluation, and that she just
be able to eat if alert enough.  By the time of discharge, she
was taking food and medications PO.
.
Discharge Diagnosis:
Severe multiple sclerosis.
Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
Hyponatremia, secondary to SIADH
Seizure disorder.
Sepsis of unclear source.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old woman with
a past medical history significant for severe multiple
sclerosis times twenty-five years resulting in chronic
debilitation and a recent left lower lobe community acquired
pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia, which required
intubation, who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
secondary to acute respiratory distress.  The patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
[**2128-1-19**], with community acquired pneumonia versus aspiration
pneumonia.  She was started on empiric Levofloxacin and
Flagyl but her pneumonia worsened, leading to eventual
intubation [**2128-1-23**], to [**2128-1-24**].  Antibiotics were changed
to Vancomycin/Zosyn 0/15/04, but unfortunately she was
reintubated [**2128-1-27**], to [**2128-2-1**], secondary to mucous
plugging.  Intensive Care Unit course was notable for
ischemic acute tubular necrosis, fluid response of
hypotension, culture negative, guaiac positive stools
requiring two units packed red blood cells and PEJ placement
[**2128-2-4**].  She was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on
[**2128-2-6**], in good condition without any antibiotics.  The
morning of admission the patient was noted to be acutely
""cyanotic"", ""diaphoretic"" with increased heart rate to the
130s, increased respiratory rate to the 40s, blood pressure
126/76, oxygen saturation of 81% on three liters, improved to
95% on nonrebreather.  For unclear reasons, the patient was
emergently intubated by EMS in the field and brought to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department for
further evaluation.  Chest x-ray in the Emergency Department
was negative for acute infiltrate.  CT angiogram was negative
for pulmonary embolus.  Her oxygen saturation was excellent
on AC vent settings of 450 by 14, PEEP of 5, 50% FIO2.  Blood
pressure was 90s to 110s over 50 to 80, heart rate 90s to
110s.  The patient was given 0.5 mg Ativan and 1.5 liters of
normal saline.  She was also transiently bradycardic to the
30s in the Emergency Department with drop in blood pressure
and this occurred while bucking the vent, was attributed to a
vasovagal episode.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple sclerosis times twenty-five years.
2.  Gastric ulcer.
3.  Status post cesarean section.
4.  Status post recent left lower lobe pneumonia requiring
two intubations.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Beconase Nasal Spray two sprays twice a day.
2.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg once daily.
4.  Prevacid 30 mg twice a day.
5.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.
6.  Atrovent/Albuterol nebulizers twice a day.
7.  Reglan 5 mg q.h.s.
8.  Zinc 220 once daily.
9.  Zoloft 25 mg once daily.
10. Vitamin C 500 mg once daily.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, is currently at
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation, previously was living at home.  She
is married and lives with her husband.  She has a chronic
Foley.  She is dependent on all her activities of daily
living.  She has a greater than 20 pack year history of
tobacco and quit in [**2127**].  Husband, [**Name (NI) **], is her health
care proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 97.7, blood
pressure 96/52 with a MAP of 67, heart rate 92, range 90s to
110s.  Vent settings were 450 by 14, PEEP of 5, 50% FIO2,
respiratory rate 14 to 17 with a PIP of 24 and a plateau of
16.  She was saturating 100%.  In general on examination, she
is intubated, wide awake, following commands in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination -
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation, 3.0 millimeters to 2.0 millimeters, anicteric.
Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck - no lymphadenopathy, no
carotid bruit, no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly.
Lungs - Slightly decreased left base and otherwise clear.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds, no masses.  PEJ site clean,
dry and intact.  Extremities - Boots bilaterally lower
extremity, trace to 1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower
extremities, warm, good capillary refill.  Fingernails
possible fungal infection.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's admission data was
significant for white blood cell count of 11.9 which was
decreased from her previous discharge when it was 15.9.
Hematocrit was 32.0, platelet count 496,000.  Differential on
her white blood cell count was 88% neutrophils, 2% bands, 2%
lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.  Her chemistries were
significant for potassium of 3.2 and a glucose of 245.
Urinalysis was significant for a specific gravity of 1.013,
protein 30, occasional bacteria, [**3-12**] white blood cells.

Chest x-ray showed a left sided effusion, left lower lobe
atelectasis, and endotracheal tube in place.  CTA showed no
pulmonary embolus, left effusion with left lower lobe
consolidation/atelectasis, multiple nodular opacities of the
periphery with a tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance consistent with
aspiration pneumonia or other infectious etiology.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 150, left axis
deviation, poor R wave progression, T wave inversions in I
and V1, J point elevation in V2 to V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure
was thought to be secondary to mucous plugging.  She did not
have signs of infection and she was not initially started on
antibiotics.  The patient was started on pressure support as
soon as she arrived in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
day of admission, [**2128-2-24**], and was soon extubated when she
did very well on her pressure support trial.  Over the next
two days, the patient required frequent suctioning and chest
physical therapy secondary to lack of a cough due to her
severe multiple sclerosis.  Given the patient's recent
aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent mucous plugging after
extubation secondary to thick secretions and her inability to
clear them, the patient was offered a tracheostomy and the
patient and her husband agreed to this.  On [**2128-2-26**], a
tracheostomy was placed by the interventional pulmonology
team without complications.  A regular size tracheostomy was
put in place.  The day following the tracheostomy placement
while the patient was being turned, she desaturated and some
blood clots were suctioned out of the tracheostomy.  An
urgent bronchoscopy was done and several old clots were
pulled out the bronchi resulting in improved saturation.  The
patient remained on 50% face mask with 99 to 100% saturation
during the rest of her hospitalization.  Lidocaine and
Epinephrine was injected around her tracheostomy site where
there was some oozing and this resolved over the course of
the next twelve hours.  The patient was also continued on her
nebulizers and Beconase Nasal Spray.

2.  Cardiac - After the patient was admitted, a CK and
troponin was sent secondary to her sinus tachycardia.  The
patient did not have any previous history of cardiac disease.
Her troponin was elevated at 1.01.  Her CKs were not
elevated.  Over the rest of her hospital stay, troponin
levels were checked and all these trended down.  The patient
was never with chest pain.  A Baby Aspirin was started.  A
beta blocker was not started secondary to low blood pressure.
However, the troponin leak was thought to be secondary to
demand ischemia.  The patient's electrocardiograms had some T
wave inversions in III, aVF and V3, however, looking back on
previous electrocardiograms, these were intermittently also
inverted.  The patient should have an echocardiogram to
follow-up as there is no history of cardiac disease for any
new wall motion abnormality.

3.  Hypotension - During the course of her stay, the patient
occasionally was hypotensive to the high 70s systolic, low
80s.  The patient never had a high fever and her white blood
cell count never rose.  This hypotension was not thought to
be secondary to sepsis.  A random cortisol was checked and it
was normal.  The patient was bolused several times during two
nights secondary to her hypotension.  However, the patient
was asymptomatic with this and her urine output remained
steady and greater than 30cc/hour at all times.  Therefore,
it was concluded that the patient's blood pressure runs low,
especially when she is asleep and this did not need to be
aggressively treated unless the patient is symptomatic which
she does not appear to be during this hospital stay. In
addition, the patient may have some autonomic insufficiency
related to her neurologic disorder.

4.  Neurology - The patient's neurology doctor at the
rehabilitation did stop by and commented that the patient's
multiple sclerosis was atypical.  In discussion with the
patient's husband, the patient had never had a magnetic
resonance scan in the past to diagnose her, lumbar puncture,
and had had very little treatment or workup for her disease.
In addition, the patient's daughter had been recently
diagnosed with magnetic resonance scan and it was thought
that this patient's disease was not multiple sclerosis given
it was atypical.  It may be helpful to know what it is in
case this could help the patient's daughter.  Thus, a
magnetic resonance scan of the head and spine were obtained.
The patient needs to follow-up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**], to set up neurological follow-up.
The magnetic resonance scan results should also be followed
up on as they were not completed at the time of discharge.

5.  Nutrition - The patient was continued on he PEJ tube
feeds during her hospital course without high residuals or
other problems.  These should be continued while the patient
is in house.

6.  Infectious disease - The patient had blood cultures
initially on admission on [**2128-2-24**].  One bottle out of four
grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus and this was
attributed to a contaminant.  Her sputum culture grew
oropharyngeal flora, gram positive rods and gram positive
cocci.  In addition, the patient's urinalysis, which did not
have signs of infection other than [**3-12**] white blood cells, did
grow out Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.  The patient was
not treated for this as her urinalysis did not have evidence
of infection and her white blood cell count was not elevated
and she was afebrile.  The patient should be on VRE
precautions on discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to mucous plugging.
2.  Multiple sclerosis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:
1.  The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1158**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 679**] in one
week to follow-up on the magnetic resonance scan spine and
head results.  The patient could also be considered for a
neurologic referral so that she has a primary neurologist.
2.  The patient should also be considered for a future
echocardiogram to evaluate for any abnormality given recent
troponin leak attributed during this admission to demand
ischemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lansoprazole oral suspension 30 mg nasogastric twice a
day.
2.  Docusate Sodium 100 mg twice a day, hold for loose
stools.
3.  Beclomethasone AQ (nasal) two sprays intranasally twice a
day.
4.  Metoclopramide 5 mg four times a day, a.c. and h.s.

History of Present Illness:
76M h/o demyelinating disease NOS (question MS), seizure d/o,
dementia NOS (question Alzheimer'[**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 309**] body disease),
bipolar d/o, and HTN, admitted from [**Hospital3 **] facility for
unsteady gait.
.
Neurology consult was able to speak with pt's facility Cadbury
Commons ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 101435**]), and much of the HPI was derived from
their note & ED notes.  Per report, pt had not been sleeping
much for the past few days, and had been very restless at night.
 During the evening prior to admit, pt stood up at dinner,
became dizzy, looked pale and diaphoretic, and almost fell.
Personnel reported pt's gait was ""off.""  On the day of admit, at
lunch, pt again became dizzy, BP 150/80, pulse 90.  Pulse
increased to 120 after pt walked briefly.  Pt also reported to
be ""not acting like himself.""  Pt reportedly pleasant with staff
in general.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt found to be ataxic on exam, with other cerebellar
testing unremarkable.  Guaiac mildly positive ([**11-21**] slides).
Vitals normal, afebrile.  WBC slightly elevated at 13 and hct
26, decreased from 38 one year ago.  UA negative.  CT head
showed no bleed or mass.  It was felt that the pt should be
admitted for further workup of his ataxia and anemia.  When this
was communicated to the pt, he reportedly became very agitated
and, at some point, reportedly assaulted one of the ED nurses.
Because of this agitation, pt received haldol 5 mg and lorazepam
2mg.  The pt initially calmed down, then became more agitated,
requiring lorazepam IV 3mg and 4-point leather restraints.
Following administration of haldol, it was learned that pt has
had previous paradoxical reactions to this and other psych
medications in the past.
.
Pt noted to be somnolent after receiving lorazepam with SaO2 to
80s when lying flat and not on BiPAP.  However, pt. became also
intermittently agitated, becoming hypertensive and tachycardic.
.
ROS: Unable to assess when pt. arrived in MICU, though pt
frequently reported need to urinate and associated discomfort.

Brief Hospital Course:
76M h/o demyelinating disease NOS (question MS), seizure d/o,
dementia NOS (question Alzheimer'[**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 309**] body disease),
bipolar d/o, and HTN, admitted from [**Hospital3 **] facility for
unsteady gait upon standing and altered mental status, both
likely [**12-22**] to active GIB.
.
# GI bleed: Pt noted to have 10 point hct decrease within the
last year (hct = 19), as well as black tarry stool upon transfer
to MICU.  Pt intubated for urgent EGD [**8-23**]; clipped bleeding
lesion in prepyloric area.  Pt received 7 units PRBCs and 1 unit
FFP; started on pantoprazole PO BID indefinitely until otherwise
notified by primary care provider and GI specialists.  H. pylori
negative.  HCT remained stable throughout the rest of hospital
course.  Pt instructed to submit outpatient labwork for hct to
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] on Friday, [**2131-8-31**].  EGD outpatient
appointment arranged.
.
# Unsteady gait: Considered likely [**12-22**] GIB as CT and MRI/MRA
head were negative, pt demonstrated no other focal neurological
signs, and no infectious source was identified.  Pt noted to be
deconditioned per PT.  Psychiatry consult considered
polypharmacy to be unlikely contributor to preadmission unsteady
gait.  Neurology consult agreed with diagnosis of orthostasis
[**12-22**] GIB, but recommended an [**Month/Day (2) **] as an outpatient to r/o possible
abnormal electrical activity.  Pt considered ambulating well by
PT and OT, with PT arranged 2x weekly.  [**Month/Day (2) **] and neurology
outpatient follow-up arranged.
.
# Altered mental status: AMS considered likely [**12-22**] GIB per
psychiatry consult, with agitation in the ED [**12-22**] reaction to
haloperidol.  Question of underlying [**Last Name (un) 309**] body disease given
pt's paradoxical haloperidol reaction.  Psychiatry consult
recommended quetiapine PRN for agitation, with total daily dose
limited to 400mg.  Pt also restarted on home dose of trazodone
QHS.  Pt received 1:1 sitter.  AMS improved, with resolved
agitation and improved reception to verbal redirection and
calming.  Psychiatry outpatient follow-up arranged.
.
# Bipolar disorder: Pt managed with quetiapine PRN, total dose
limited to 400mg daily, and home regimen of donepezil 5 mg PO
HS.  Psychiatry outpatient follow-up arranged.
.
# Seizure d/o NOS: Pt continued on home regimen of levetiracetam
1000mg PO QHS and carbamazepine XR 400 mg PO BID.  Neurology
outpatient follow-up arranged.
.
# HTN: Pt's home regimen of valsartan 40mg daily was held during
this admission given GIB.  Pt was instructed to follow-up with
new PCP to determine when to restart BP medications.
.
# OSA: Pt received BiPAP overnight as tolerated.  Pt's home
regimen of modafinil 150mg daily was held during this admission
given pt's agitation.  Pt was instructed to follow-up with
outpatient providers to determine when to restart modafinil.
.
# Osteopenia: Pt's home regimen of alendronate 70mg qweekly was
held during this admission.
.
# Depression: Pt continued on home regimen of duloxetine 90 mg
PO daily and trazodone 150 mg QHS.  Psychiatry outpatient
follow-up arranged.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because you had a change in mental
status and you were unsteady on your feet.  We found that you
had a GI bleed.  We clipped the bleeding vessel in your stomach,
but we had to intubate you (put a tube in your airway) to help
you breathe during that procedure.
.
We believe your blood loss could have caused you to be unsteady
on your feet and contributed to your mental status changes.
Your bleeding was NOT because of Helicobacter pylori infection,
as our lab results show that you are negative for this bacterial
infection.
.
We have given you a new medication for the bleeding in your
stomach:
# For your stomach: Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily.  Continue
taking this medication until your primary care provider or GI
specialist tells you to stop.
.
We have STOPPED three of your medications:
# Because you were bleeding, we have temporarily stopped your
aspirin 81 mg daily.  Do not restart this until after your
second esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) confirms that you are
still no longer bleeding.  Talk to your primary care doctor
about whether to restart the aspirin.
.
# Because you were bleeding, we temporarily stopped your
valsartan 40 mg daily, which you take for your blood pressure.
Talk to your primary care doctor about when to restart your
valsartan.
.
# Because you were agitated, we stopped your modafinil.  Talk to
your psychiatrist about when to restart this.
.
Otherwise, we have not changed any of your medications.
.
It will be important to have two follow-up procedures:
# Esophogastroduodenoscopy: This will be important to see if you
are still bleeding in the stomach.  We have made an appointment
for you (see below).
.
# Electroencephalogram: This will be important to see if you
have abnormal brain activity which may have contributed to your
unsteady gait.  We have made an appointment for you (see below).
.
It will be important to follow up with your doctors.  We have
listed your appointments below.
.
Also, you should have your red blood cell levels checked on
Friday, [**8-31**].  We have written a laboratory order for
that.  Please fax those results to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2795**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 908**], the GI
doctor who worked with you, at fax ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 101441**].
.
If you experience any dizziness, changes in your walking, or
changes in your mental status, or if you notice black, tarry
stools, please go immediately to the emergency room and call
your GI doctors (their names are listed below).

Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed-In the MICU the pt had a transfusion of total 6 units
of FFP, Hct dropped to 27.5 subsequently increased to 33.5. INR
was lowered to 1.8. Stable hemodynamics. EGD on [**2164-1-11**] showed
mild gastritis and duodenitis. Colonscopy on [**1-13**] tiny polyps
in the distal rectum, lipoma in the cecum, nodular infiltrate
with purplish, edematous, and friable mucosa in the left colon
near the splenic flexure from 55 to 45 cm. Erythematous and
congested mucosa with patchy ulcerations from 45 to 25 cm.
Biopsy was taken. Pt was transfered to the floor for further
management.
In the setting of supratherapeutic INR: Unclear source.
Colonoscopy showed friable mucosa in splenic flexure with
stranding on CT. Due to history of hypotensive episode and
distribution is vascular watershed area this was thought to be
due to ischemic colitis. Contributing factor was INR 7.0. Hct
has been remained stable for 72h but was transfused 1 U PRBC's
due to feeilng of weakness on [**2164-1-16**] with apropriate rise in
Hct. Biopsies from colonoscopy will need to be followed up and
relayed to the the patient likely via her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

.
# Elevated INR: Has been on couamdin for DVT and plavix for CVA.
No DVT in RLE on doppler but was a suboptimal study. Since
ischemic bowel was not thought to be due to embolic source but
pt had hx of TIA and DVT with PE heparin was starting with goal
PTT of 50-70 until coumadin was titrated to INR 2.0-2.2 with
plan for undershoot since history of GIB. After approval from GI
plavix was also restarted.
.

# Tachycardia: Intially thought to be due to GI bleed although
has been chronic. CTA in past have been negative showing no PRE
as cause. She had one episone of an asymptomatic 10 beat run of
NSVT on [**2164-1-16**]. She remained hypertensive and was started on
low dose metoprolol at 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. . WBC normal and afebrile today
- unlikely infection.
.
# Diabetes: Long-standing. On NPH and ISS with FS remaining
mostly in the 130-180 range. Continued ISS and [**2-13**] NPH as NPO.
.
# MS: No active disease per patient. Not on steroids or
immunosuppresants.
.
# Seizure history: on tegretol and Levatiracetam. CT head w/o
bleed. EEG was negative for epileptiform activity. She was seen
by neurology who witness arm twitch and felt that it was due to
seizure activity. Per neurology she was started on Keppra which
was titrated up to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] with plan to titrate of the
carbamazepine with 100mg qid for 5 days then 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5
days and then discontinue. pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 100771**].

# Recent DVT - Had been on coumadin. No clinical evidence of PE
at present, although she had concerning tachycardia and low
grade fever. RLE u/s was negative but LLE not done due to
patient noncompliance. Coumadin restarted as above with heparin
bridge on day of discharge heparin was at 1900 u/hr with stable
PTT.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Foot Ulcers
She was initially admitted to the podiatry service on [**2167-7-10**]
for debridement of left foot wound. She was evaluated by
vascular surgery who performed right side angiography, revealing
significant SFA and popliteal disease which was not intervened
upon. She was covered with cipro/flagyl/vanco (Day 1 = [**2167-7-10**]),
and remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout her
hospital course.  She was then transitioned to bactrim to
complete a 2 week course of outpatient therapy, last day
[**2167-7-28**]. She will be following up in 1 week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She
will have home VNA for assistance with daily dressing changes.

2. Seizures
She was to be discharged to home with TMP/SMX and then follow-up
with podiatry in one week. On the morning of likely discharge
while eating breakfast, she asked to be transferred to the
comode to pass a BM. On the comode she describes acute onset of
nausea and weakness. She then was witnessed to have multiple,
recurrent brief episodes of ""staring spells"" during which she
was unresponsive. In between these episodes she responded
appropriately to voice. Based on concern for seizures, she was
given ativan 1mg x 2 without response. Neurology consult was
obtained who described persistant complex partial status, and
recommended ativan 2mg x 1 with subsequent dilantin loading. The
pt remained in status for ~30-45 min.
 By report, during the episode, her O2 sats dropped to 79%RA,
but BP was stable. Post event, transfer note indicates VS 98.8
109/68 92 14 98%3L. Immediately after her the seizures, pt was
with the above vital signs, sitting up in bed, somnolent,
responsive to voice. Her somnolence intermittently resolved,
notably upon the arrival of her PCP whom she recognized and
spoke with. MICU transfer was requested in the setting of
persistent complex partial status for closer airway monitoring
and for evaluation of potential contribution by patient's
multiple medical conditions. Etiology of her seizures was
thought likely related to poorly controlled seizures, further
triggered by infection and decreased seizure threshold in the
setting of quinolone therapy.
  On the floor, she remained seizure free. She refused EEG as
recommended by Neuro. She was started on Zonegram per Neuro in
addition to her home Carbamazepine. IV Dilantin was
discontinued. CT Head was negative for bleed. She was resumed on
her home coumadin. Pt has an appt scheduled with neuro for
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], given limited availability of
appts with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was given the number to call to
check for cancellations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. h/o DVT
Pt had been transitioned off coumadin in anticipation of wound
debridgement/surgical intervention. She was resumed on Coumadin
with Lovenox bridge after CT Head negative for bleed. She was
discharged home on her home coumadin dose (no Lovenox bridge,
with hx of remote and fully treated DVT), with INR to be checked
and followed by the [**Hospital 2786**] clinic.
.
# Transaminitis. New on [**7-15**] AM labs (but no LFTs done prior in
admission). Etiology unclear - ?new drug effect. Seems soon for
dilantin (within ~1 hour). Cipro a rare cause; should not be
flagyl or vanco related. No rash or other evidence of drug
reaction. Could also possibly be related to anesthesia meds
during angiography. Atorvastatin was held and will be

CXR ([**6-9**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
62F with h/o MS, sarcoid, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DMII, CAD s/p
stents, PAD s/p L BKA, h/o CVA and recurrent DVTs who was
recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 100782**] for dyspnea and was
treated for exacerbation of reactive airway disease in setting
of recent URI, now presented back to ED for shortness of breath
and wheezing, likely from exactly the same etiology:
exacerbation of reactive airway disease/asthma/COPD.
.
# Dyspnea: The patient has known reactive airways
disease/Asthma/COPD and this appears to be an exacerbation of
the same process during her prior hospitalization. She does not
appear fluid overloaded, BNP 41, no evidence of PNA on CXR, and
she refused CTA to rule out PE but has been on warfarin.
Pulmonary was consulted. They recommended CT chest, which showed
evidence of bronchitis. PFTs were performed, but report not
available at time of discharge. ECHO showed normal EF with no
valvular abnormalities. Patient reports she has no nebulizers at
home, which is surprising since she has been discharged home
with nebulizers every time when she was discharged recently. We
set up a nebulizer for her this time. She was continued with
Albuterol & Ipratropium nebs. She was started on prednisone 60mg
PO x5 days, followed by prednisone taper. She was discharged
home with albuterol nebulizer and prednisone taper.
.
# Recent UTI: Patient had continued evidence of infection on UA
with chronic indwelling foley. She had known Pan-sensitive
Proteus. Of note, she did not fill her Bactrim for UTI
prescription on discharge. She was continued on Bactrim DS PO
BID x3 more days during this hospital stay.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus/Hypoglycemia/Altered mental status: On the
morning of [**6-14**] the pt was found to be altered on the floor.
Fingerstick was performed and in the 40s, the pt was given D50
and mental status improved significantly.  Fingersticks were in
the low 80s-90s overnight in the ICU, morning NPH was held.  The
afternoon upon callout, the pts glucose was up to 380s and SSI
was given. Patient's insulin dose was decreased afterwards, and
she had no more episodes of hypoglycemia.
.
# Chest pain/hypotension: After pts episode of hypoglycemia, she
began to complain of substernal chest pain, similar in character
to her ongoing angina.  She was given SL NTG, after which she
became hypotensive and remained that way for 3-4 hours on the
floor.  Refractory to 2-3L of IV NSS.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU at that point for her ongoing
hemodynamic instability.  With an additional 2L of IV NSS
overnight in the ICU pts SBPs improved back to baseline and
remained that way until she was called out to the floor the
following afternoon.  She remained chest pain free. Plavix,
Statin, Imdur, and Metoprolol were continued. She is allergic to
aspirin.
.
# HTN: We decreased imdur to 60mg daily and metoprolol to 37.5
mg [**Hospital1 **]. Lisinopril was held.
.
# History of Recurrent DVTs: Coumadin was continued. Her
admission INR was 2.0. She was briefly on heparin gtt when her
INR was subtherapeutic. LENIS showed that while no DVT was
definitively seen, the right distal superficial femoral vein did
not fully compress, and a nonocclusive thrombus could not be
completely excluded. She was therapeutic on coumadin at time of
discharge.
.
# PAD s/p L BKA: Patient has a healing ulcer on RLE. She was
seen by [**Hospital1 1106**] while she was in the hospital, but arteriogram
was not done because she could not lie flat. Vicodin was
continued.
.
# Seizure Disorder: Carbamazepime was continued.
.
# CODE: The code status was changed from full to DNR/DNI during
this hospital stay per discussion with patient.
.
# CONTACT: Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 100774**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100775**].

IMAGING
TTE [**2166-7-9**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments. Doppler
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic
function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate pericardial effusion, located
mostly over the right ventricular free wall. Regional LV
systolic dysfunction consistent with prior inferior infarction.
No significant valvular abnormality. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
CXR [**2166-7-19**]
1. Slight interval worsening of findings at the right base, with
more
confluent opacity and new small right effusion.
2. Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the left
costophrenic angle are stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
76 year old M PMHx multiple sclerosis, CAD s/p stent who
presented with increasing fatigue, was found to have an
aspiration PNA, and had a hospital course complicated by
recurrent aspirations, now status post tracheostomy and gtube
placement, hemodynamically stable, on antibioitics for recurrent
pneumonia, being discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab MACU.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Respiratory Failure [**1-8**] Aspiration Pneumonia and Heart Failure
On day after admission, pt w rising leukocytosis and increasing
oxygen requirements, CXR demonstrating RLL consolidation.
Patient was transferred to ICU where he was intubated for
hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was treated with 1wk
vanc/zosyn with subsequent improvement.  Patient was also found
to have evidence of pulmonary vascular congestions and was
diuresed.  Patient was subsequently extubated.  Swallow study
demonstrated aspiration.  Patient required reintubation several
days later after development of respiratory distress attributed
to recurrent aspiration.
Spoke with patient's neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt that patient
had been losing weight for the past year and while his
difficulty swallowing could be a reversible symptom of worsened
MS in the setting of acute illness, more perminent enteral
access was recommended.  PEG tube was placed.  Given recurrent
aspiration pneumonias and difficulty extubating, patient
underwent tracheostomy.  He tolerated tube feeds well.  As of
time of discharge, patient remained with signs of a RLL
pneumonia, cultures growing pan-sensitive enterobacter, which
was being treated with PO cipro ( to be continued until
[**2166-7-25**]).  He remained w secretions, but was otherwise stable
off of the ventilator on trach-mist >48hrs.  Continued nebs
standing.  Patient will need eval for pauci-muir valve in
future.
.
# Chronic Lower GI Bleed - The patient was anemic to hgb 9.2 on
admission with guiac + stools. His PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**] reported that the
patient has had significant weight loss of 40lbs over the past 6
months with decreased appetite and worsening anemia over that
time period.  No known etiology and colonoscopy clean in [**2157**].
He received 1 unit of PRBC in the ED and hct remained stable
during the rest of hospitalization.  Outpt colonoscopy should be
considered after d/c.  Started IV Pantoprazole.
.
INACTIVE
# CAD s/p stent - Per discussion w PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 4532**], continued
ASA.
.
# HTN - Home atenolol, isosorbide, and losartan held in setting
of fluctuating BP.  Will need to be evaluated for restarting
prn.
.
#CHF - In setting of acute illness, had standing lasix held.  At
time of discharge, was being dosed 20mg IV lasix prn, will need
to have fluid status reassessed with lasix dosed appropriately
.
# DM - Continued sliding scale insulin
.
# MS - Continued baclofen, scopolamine patch.  Bethanachol and
gabapentin held, can be restarted prn.
.
# BPH - Held uroxatral, can be restarted at rehab prn
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt is full code.  He will need antibiotics until [**2166-7-25**].  He
will require frequent suctioning for management of his
secretions.  He will also likely need intermittent lasix dosing
to maintain euvolemia.  He should also have a colonoscopy to
evaluate BRBPR, weight loss and constipation.  He should remain
NPO and be fed via tube feeds.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1661**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization
at [**Hospital1 69**].  You were hospitalized
with malaise and weakness.  While you were here we noticed that
food was going down the wrong tube into your lung.  You had
recurrent issues with your breathing and required a tracheostomy
to help with your breathing.  You also had a gastric tube placed
to help with your feeding.  You are now ready for discharge to
an extended care facility.

Please see the attached sheet for your updated medications

pneumonia and repeated aspiration events, status post trach
([**2166-7-16**]) and G-tube placement, now presenting from [**Hospital1 **] ICU
with respiratory distress and increased secretions that are
difficult to clear. Per OSH records, pt has had at least 2
hospitalizations for aspiration vs pneumonia since trach
placement in [**Month (only) 216**].  Most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 882**]
from [**Date range (1) 64240**], found to have LLL pna and ESBL E coli in sputum
and currently treated with ertopenem.  Presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-26**] from [**Hospital1 1501**] due to increased secretions and
decreased O2 sats and concern for possible tube feeds in
respiratory secretions.  He remained afebrile with stable vital
signs, without leukocytosis. Blood cx grew GPC in [**12-10**] bottles,
sputum grew sparse GNRs.  CXR on HD#1 showed retrocardiac
opacity c/f infiltrate, however this opacity had resolved on
repeat CXR HD#2.  At [**Hospital1 **] had emergent bronch for bradycardia
and hypoxia, per report large thick secretion removed from BIM
and LMB. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trach replacment.

Of note, pt also found to be anemic with guaiac postiive stool
c/f GI bleed given history of previous GIB.  Received 2u pRBCs.
GI service consulted, recommended trending Hct and transfusing
as needed, IV PPI - pt is at high risk for invasive GI
procedures.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male with MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 103518**] elements status post trach
and G-tube placement and recent ESBL pna admitted to OSH for
hypoxia and increased trach secretions and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for trach replacement.

# Trach tube - Interventional pulmonology was called to evaluate
for trach tube replacement. They felt that the diameter of the
tube was not large enough for suctioning of secretions. The tube
was replaced by IP while on the floor and patient had
improvement in ability to clear secretions.  Patient was
initally maintained on 40% O2 via trach mask, but was
transitioned to room air with 100% saturations.

# Pneumonia - Continued ertopenem for ESBL pneumonia and
completed prior hospital course.  [**Hospital3 4107**] records
demonstrated patient growing pan-sensitive pseudomonus from
sputum culture on [**10-28**].  This was felt to be a chronic
colonizer rather than infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as patient had clear CXR,
normal WBC, afebrile and had baseline oxygen requirements.
Treatment of this culture finding was defered.

# GPC Bacteremia - One of four bottles at outside hospital were
found to be positive for coag negative staph. Assumed to be a
contaminate given his clinical status. Initially started on
vancomycin, then stopped when speciated.

# Anemia - Hct to 21 while at outside hospital, received 2
units. Did not require additional PRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**]. Hct was
monitored and remained stable at 29.

# Multiple Sclerosis:  stable, continued on home medications.

# Coronary Artery Disease:  stable, issue continued on home
medications including [**Hospital1 4532**].

# Hyperlipidemia:  stable issue, continued on home medications.


# Hypertension:  stable issue, continued on home medications.

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased secretions and work of breathing


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with PMH progressive MS s/p trach and G-tube placement
for recurrent aspirations, recent ESBL E. coli PNA transferred
from an OSH with hypoxia and hypotension.

The patient presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on the day prior to admission
after his trach tube had fallen out. His trach was replaced in
the ED, and he was subsequently discharged. He returned to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with increased work of breathing, increased secretions
from his trach, hypoxia (74% unclear O2 delivery), and BP 69/59.
Per report, his trach was suctioned aggressively. A L femoral
central line was placed, and after 4L IVF his BP improved to
110/65 and HR improved to 100. At the time of transfer, he was
satting 98% on 12L humidified air via trach mask. CXR
demonstrated R-sided infiltrate/pneumonitis and his UA was
positive. Initial troponin was 0.2 and lactate 9.3. He was given
vancomycin, ceftazadime (h/o pseudomonas sensitive) and
gentamycin.

History of E. coli in urine ([**2160**]) resistent to bactrim and
flouroquinolones.  Patient admitted in [**7-/2166**] with hypoxic
respiratory failure and RLL aspiration PNA.  Due to
deterioration of MS in the acute setting as well as difficulty
extubation [**1-8**] recurrent aspiration, PEG and trach were placed.
Sputum culture grew Enterobacter resistent to ceftriaxone and
ceftazidime.  Treated initially with Vanc/Zosyn, then narrowed
to PO cipro.   In [**10/2166**], admitted to OSH with LLL PNA, ESBL E.
coli and treated with Ertapenem.

In the ED inital vitals were, 98 116 90/60 20 100% 15L. Lactate
3.1.  He was given 1L NS, then transferred to the ICU.

On arrival to the ICU, VS: 96.2; 126; 110/84; 22; 95% trach mask
15L; 40%. Patient has diminished mental status though unclear
whether this is close to his baseline. Patient is unable to
describe any further symtpoms, including chest pain and
shortness of breath.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, son added chronic b/l LE weakness and right facial
droop
(-) Per son, HCP, denies fever, chills, cough, chest pain.

Imaging:
CXR [**2166-11-15**]- Large scale consolidation in the right lower lung,
predominantly lower lobe, was new earlier today compared to
[**11-1**]. It has grown slightly more radiodense over the past
eight hours, probably active pneumonia. Small right pleural
effusion is presumed and should be monitored in order to detect
any development of empyema. Left lung is clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The patient has a
tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2166-11-16**] (following PICC placement)- Right PIC line has been
repositioned, tip is approximately 2 cm below the estimated
location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
Extensive consolidation right mid and lower lung zone stable
since [**11-15**], increased at the left base since [**11-15**]
consistent with worsening pneumonia. There is no pulmonary
edema. Heart size is normal. Tracheostomy tube in standard
placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
76 y/o M with PMH progressive multiple sclerosis s/p trach and
G-tube placement for recurrent aspiration PNA, recent
Enterobacter and [**Hospital 40097**] [**Hospital 11091**] transferred from an OSH with hypoxia,
hypotension and focal consolidation on CXR. He was treated for a
pneumonia with IV antibiotics and transferred to an LTAC for
further care. His hospital course was complicated by tachycardia
and volume overload.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Septic Shock: At outside hospital, patient met SIRS criteria
with tachycardia, bandemia and tachypnea.  He was afebrile, but
hypotensive and not responsive to fluid boluses, and had a
lactate of >9.  CXR at outside hospital, and confirmed at [**Hospital1 18**]
showed new right lower lobe opacity.  In addition, he had a
positive urinalysis.  Patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin and meropenem to cover
hospital acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection, with
history of ESBL e.coli UTIs.  Lactate trended down, was 3 on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], and was normal by HD1.  Patient required a
total of 6L NS in fluids, and then was placed on phenylephrine
for blood pressure support.  Pressors were weaned on HD1.
Patient had a PICC line placed on HD1 for antibiotic
administration, with plan to continue broad spectrum antibiotics
for 14 days, day 1= [**2166-11-15**].  At the time of discharge, urine
culture was positive for both enterococcus and ecoli, which were
speciated to VRE however < 3000 colonies so therfore not
treated. Sputum cultures were contaminated but speciated to
pseudomonas and ecoli.  Blood cultures were still pending or
negative at the time of transfer. At the time of transfer he was
day [**7-20**] of meropenem for esbl pneumonia.  He completed 7 days
of vancomycin which was discontinued prior to transfer given
absence of culture driven data.
- Continue IV Meropenem for 6 additional days to complete 14 day
course
.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: Thought to be due to recurrent
pneumonia, likely aspiration despite tube feeds through PEG.  On
arrival to ICU, sat's were in the 90s on tach mask at FiO2 35%.
ABG 7.44/34/87.  Patient was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics as above, with plan to treat for 14 days.  Patient
was at his baseline at the time of discharge.  Interventional
pulmonology saw patient while in-house and were concerned about
recurrent aspirations and recommended that G-tube be changed to
J-tube.  Head of bed was elevated to prevent aspirations in
addition to frequent suctioning of oral secretions.  He was
diuresed prior to transfer given total fluid balance during his
hospital stay was over 10 liters. He was placed on a lasix drip
prior to transfer in an effort to achieve relative [**Name (NI) 52753**].
- [**Name2 (NI) **] should be continued on bolus lasix 20 IV for [**Name2 (NI) **] net
negative 1 liter per day.
- At the time of discharge he was 7 liters up total length of
stay.
.
# Tachycardia: Documented initially as sinus, with rates in the
120s. He went into atrial fibrillation with short bursts into
the 190s that were felt to be supraventricular.  As blood
pressure was stable, home metoprolol was restarted on the
evening of admission and was titrated up for improved heart rate
control. Tachycardia coincided with aggressive diuresis.  He
flipped back into sinus rhythm and his metoprolol was ultimately
down-titrated to tid dosing.
- Increase metoprolol to 12.5 mg tid
.
Chronic issues:
# CAD s/p stent- Unknown when stents were placed, but at higher
risk of cardiac event in the setting of sepsis, hypoperfusion,
and tachycardia.  Aspirin and [**Name2 (NI) 4532**] were continued.  Cardiac
enzymes were flat.
.
# Anemia- patient with chronic anemia and history of guaiac
positive stools.  No signs of bleeding from recent EGD prior to
PEG placement in 08/[**2165**].  No colonoscopy records.  Baseline Hct
26-29.  Was 29 on arrival.  Noted to have coffee grounds in oral
suction. He was started on IV protonix for [**3-12**] week course.
- Start IV protonix for [**3-12**] week course.
.
# HTN - Continued home metoprolol as above.
.
# sCHF - EF in [**7-/2166**] 40-45% with focal WMA.
.
# DM - Started on humalog insulin sliding scale while an
inpatient.
.
# MS - History of progressive MS, also recently developed
[**Year (4 digits) 103518**] symptoms and started on carbidopa-levodopa.
Continued all home medications includeing baclofen and sinement.
.
# Transitional issues:
- blood cultures pending
- code status: full (Discussed at length with patient and health
care proxy while hospitalized. Patient was able to express
understanding regarding discussion and wish for continued full
code status)

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with MS, DM2, CAD s/p RCA stent, PVD s/p R BKA, history
of CVA and DVTs, presents with ? seizure activity found to have
9 point Hct drop with guaiac positive stools, refused
EGD/colonoscopy, received 3 units pRBC with appropriate
response, who was hemodynamically stable for the remained of the
hospitalization.
.
# GI bleed: On admission, patient was found to have Hct of 21,
down from baseline of 30, and guaiac positive stool. Admitted to
ICU where she received 3 units of pRBC, bringing Hct to 26. INR
was found to be supratherapeutic at 3 and was reversed with Vit
K, bringing it down to 1.3. GI consulted but patient refused EGD
and colonoscopy. Transferred to the floor and remained HD
stable.
.
# Epistaxis: Patient developed an unprovoked nosebleed, which
stopped after 1.5 hours of pressure. INR was 1.4 at the time and
on heparin drip, which was temporarily held. ENT was consulted
but didn't get cauderization. Treated with nasal spray and
Oxymetazoline. There was no resulting drop in her Hct.
.
# History of DVT/CVA: Patient complained of right leg pain on
admission and LENI ruled out DVT. Given her history of CVA/DVT,
decision was made to restart her home anticoagulation regimen
including coumadin and plavix. Her INR slowly rose and at the
time of discharge it was therapeutic at 2.0.
.
# Seizures: On admission, patient complained of dizziness and
visual changes, consistent with prior seizures, normally evoked
by stress. Neurology consulted but did not find signs of active
seizure. Kept on home dose of tegretol.
.
# Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications were initially
held in the context of her GI bleed with resulting blood
pressure 160-180/80-100. Antihypertensives were restarted once
she became HD stable.
.
# CAD: No active signs of ACS despite the low Hct on admission.
EKG without ischemic changes. Once HD stable she was restart on
home plavix dose and also imdur for angina.
.
# DM2: Patient was kept on home regimen of NPH and regular
insulin, with resulting blood sugar ranging from 160 - 250.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100774**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical
Center because you had some symptoms suggestive of seizures
while you were at the ophthalmologist's office. When you arrived
at the hospital, we did some blood tests and found that your red
blood cell count was very low and there was evidence of blood in
your stool. We were very concerned that you might be actively
bleeding so you were briefly admitted to the intensive care unit
where you received a total of 3 units of red blood cells. We
also gave you vitamin K because your INR was elevated which made
you more likely to bleed. You were then transferred to the
regular medical floor. You did not want an endoscopy or
colonoscopy to look for the source of bleeding. After extensive
discussion, we restarted you on your home anticoagulation
medications. We asked the neurologists to see you to make sure
you were not having seizures. They did not think you were. You
were kept on your home medications for seizure prophylaxis. You
had a nosebleed and we asked the ear, nose, and throat doctors
to [**Name5 (PTitle) 788**] [**Name5 (PTitle) **]. They did not feel that you needed cauterization. We
also put you back on your hypertension medications. You also had
an eye exam by one of the ophthalmologists here prior to
discharge.
.
We did not make any changes to your medications.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old woman with multiple sclerosis, paraplegia,
DM, CAD s/p RCA stents in [**2165**], PVD, prior CVA, multiple DVTs on
warfarin, who presented to the with headache, fatigue, and
nausea. She says that her headache has been gradually increasing
over the past two days and is described as throbbing, like her
head is going to explode. She denies visual changes or
photophobia but is mostly blind. She denies neck stiffness,
fevers.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 100774**] tells me her last bowel movement was Monday (3 days
ago) and was, to her recollection, normal. In particular she
denies bright red blood or black stool. She does endorse
light-headedness for several days. She denies any NSAID use but
does take warfarin and clopidogrel as prescribed.
.
In the ED, 98 106 133/63 18 100% 15L. Patient's labs were
significant for a Hct of 14.7 (baseline 25-28, most recently
checked 1 month ago) and INR 7.6. She was noted to have formed
guaiac negative brown stool on rectal exam. She was given 5mg po
Vit K, and startted on IV protonix . The patient refused NG
lavage. She initially refused head CT head but later consented.
This was normal. CT abdomen was attempted but the patient had a
panic attack in the scanner despite pre-treatment with 2 mg IV
Ativan. She was given 2U FFP and 2U pRBC.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of ongoing
headache. She also complains of palpitations which she says are
chronic. Review of systems was negative for nausea, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, vomitting, fevers, chills.

Portable CXR [**2168-12-29**]:
FINDINGS: No consolidation or edema is evident. Calcification is
seen at the ascending aorta. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
but stable. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. Degenerative
changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
CT Head w/o contrast [**2168-12-29**]:
FINDINGS: Study is limited by patient inability to lie flat and
large field of view used. There is significant underlying
hyperostosis totalis resulting in further degradation of image
quality. With this limitation in mind, there is no large
intracranial hemorrhage, large acute territorial infarction, or
large masses. Ventricles and sulci are stable in size and
configuration.  There is no shift of midline structures.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are within normal
limits. Diffuse hyperostosis is seen of the calvarium.

IMPRESSION: Limited study without gross evidence of acute
intracranial
process.
.
Abd Ultrasound [**2169-1-1**]:
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation of
the abdomen was performed. Evaluation of the liver is somewhat
limited due to patient's body habitus. However, there is no
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. No focal hepatic lesions are
identified. The gallbladder demonstrates sludge, but is
otherwise normal in appearance.

The right kidney measures 9.9 cm. The left kidney measures 12.8
cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stones or mass. The left kidney
demonstrates a cyst at the upper pole measuring up to 3 cm in
size.

The spleen measures up to 11.1 cm in size, which is unchanged
since the prior CT study of [**2165-9-30**]. The pancreas is not
well visualized due to overlying bowel gas.

IMPRESSION:
1. Spleen measuring 11.1 cm in size, within normal limits, and
unchanged
since the prior CT of [**2165-9-30**].
2. Sludge within the gallbladder. Gallbladder is otherwise
normal in
appearance.
.
EGD [**2169-1-3**]:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with multiple sclerosis, DM, CAD s/p RCA stens
in [**2165**], PVD, prior CVA, and multiple DVTs, h/o spinal cord
compression with no sensation below T10 who presented with
anemia with a Hct 14.7, hemodynamically stable.

#. Anemia: Presented with Hct 14.7, was 28 about a monht ago in
the setting of INR of 7.1   Was guaiac negative in the ED,
refused NG lavage and abd CT, and did not have abd, back, or
flank pain or ecchymosis to suggest RP bleed.  Received 5 units
of PRBC and 2 units of FFP over hospital course and
anticoagulation, with plavix, aspirin, coumadin were held.  GI
was consulted and recommended IV PPI and also EGD and
colonoscopy to evaluate for the source of what was likely a slow
GI bleed, considering her hemodynamic stability with profound
anemia.  Hemolysis labs were negative and iron studies were
notable for iron deficiency.
Patient refused golytely prep for [**Last Name (un) **], but EGD was performed
with assistance from anesthesia considering her limited neck
mobility.  EGD showed no source of bleed in the upper GI tract.
Hct remained stable at 25-26 after transfusions and INR was 1.1
on discharge, and she remained hemodynamically stable.  She will
be discharged with PO pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] for the next two weeks
and then once a day for presumed GI bleed.  She will also have
weekly CBCs done by her VNA.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital for severe anemia.  For this, you
received several blood transfusions and you had an EGD which
looked at your GI tract for a source of a bleed.  These studies
showed a normal stomach and esophagus and no source of bleed.

You also had a headache initially, that improved with tylenol
and tramadol. A CT scan of your head didn't show a bleed or
other cause for your headache.

Changes to your medications:
Start taking tramadol as needed for your headache

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 64yo female with a history of asthma, question COPD
not on home O2, CAD (s/p RCA stents [**12-19**]), PVD s/p BKA, IDDM,
and multiple DVTs (on warfarin) who presented to the hospital
with acute respiratory distress requiring ICU admission.
.
#Hypoxia/Respiratory distress: She was initially admitted to the
ICU for respiratoy distress.  She was treated for acute
exacerbation of her underlying asthma with aggressive
bronchodilator therapy, steroid burst, and she was also started
on empiric antibiotics for possible HCAP, given some haziness on
chest x-ray.  All her culture data returned negative.  Her
repeat chest x-ray remained stable, and her respiratory status
returned to baseline.  She was transferred to the General
Medical floor given her stability.  Given the absence of growth
from her respiratory culture, she was tailored to single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
antibiotic therapy with Levaquin, and will complete a course of
antibiotics.  She will also complete a quick steroid taper.  She
will need a repeat CXR to assess for resolution of the basilar
opacities seen bilaterally, should be repeated in [**5-18**] weeks,
assuming clinical stability.
.
#Pyuria without evidence of UTI: Pt had indwelling Foley for
recurrent UTIs.  UA on admission showed 38 WBC, mod leukocyte
esterase, neg nitrites, no bacteria, 1 epi; no urinary symptoms
to suggest infection.  Urine cx was negative.
.
#H/o DVTs, on warfarin: INR 1.7 on admission; no missed home
doses per pt.  Given h/o multiple DVTs and CVA, pt was put on
lovenox bridge until INR in therapeutic range.  INR on discharge
on day of discharge is 1.6
.
#CAD s/p BMS to mid-RCA in [**12-19**] (repeat cath [**9-19**] showed <30%
in-stent restenosis), LVEF>55% per TTE [**6-21**].  Continued home
clopidogrel (pt allergic to ASA) and metoprolol.
.
#HLD: continued home atorvastatin.
.
#HTN: continued home nitrate.  Furosemide restarted after pt
gently volume-resuscitated.
.
#Type II IDDM: on insulin SS; continued home NPH.
.
#Seizure disorder: carbamazepine was in therapeutic range (8.2)
on admission.  Continued home carbamazepine.
.
#PVD s/p BKA: continued home baclofen for spasm.
.
#OSA: pt declined CPAP.

Brief Hospital Course:
 This is a  80 yo female with history of MS, alzheimers,
hypertension who presents from a nursing home with one day of
back pain, fever and confusion who was found to have MSSA
bacterimia and developed an ileus and transaminitis.
.
#BACTERIMIA/BACK PAIN: Given patients history of acute onset,
change in mental status, fever and elevated WBCs this was
concerning for sepsis/infection paraspinal abcess,
osteomyelitis. Given history of osteoporosis, compression
fracture was also in the differential but preliminarily no
evidence on CT chest. MRI T&L done on [**2139-7-9**] which showed no
acute processes. She was given broad spectrum antibiotics
including:  ciprofloxacin and ceftaxine were given x1, Vanco IV
x 2 days until her blood culture results were available. She was
foud to have MSSA so she was started on Nafcillin 2 gm IV Q4
hrs, from [**7-10**]->[**7-13**]. Nafcillin was stopped due to increased in
LFTs, RUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She was started
on Cefazolin 2 gm IV Q 8hrs. Patient's condition had overall
improved, her confusion resolved on the second day of admission
although she has Alzheimers at baseline. She states to always
have a baseline backpain, but it was much improved from
admission. Pt was also found to have a UTI + E.Coli which she
was treated for a total of 3 days, urine culture was repeated on
[**7-11**] which was negative.

Patient also has been followed by infectious diseases who gave
antibiotic recommendations. She had a PICC line placed on
[**2139-7-13**] which she had removed after the first day, she stated
that if was ictching and she pulled it out. She had another PICC
replaced on her Right AC which was working well prior to
discharge.
.
# Nausea and vomiting: pt complained of nausea and vomited a
small amount of greenish fluid on [**2138-7-12**] and [**7-13**]. she also had
tenderness on her right upper quad. Abdominal US showed
cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Since Naficillin can cause
some liver toxicity, the medication was discontinued.
Transaminitis started to trend down. However, on [**2139-7-14**]
patient's abdomen looked distended, tympanic, and she continued
to complaint of RUQ abdominal pain. She had increased liquid BMs
for the prior 2 days which were attributed to motility agents
she had received. Given that she was in numerous antibiotics,
stool was sent for C-Diff and place her on prophylactic Flagyl
500mg PO. We also did a KUB which showed an ileus. This was most
likely related to an functional ileus, since she was on
narcotics, laying in bed with decreased mobility, and no BM for
a 4-5 days prior to receiving motility agents. She was made NPO
for 1 day. On physical exam her abdomen on the following day was
soft, continued to be mildly distended, but less tender. + BS x
4 quads and she had two BMs. We advanced her diet. She has been
tolerating her diet well with no N/v and no complain of
abdominal pain.
Her C-diff culture was negative and her Flagyl was D/c on
[**2139-7-16**].

#TRANSMIANITIS: As noted above she had sl. increase in AST, ALT
and Alk phos with nausea and vomiting for 2 days and RUQ
tenderness. This was thought to be related to the Nafcillin.
Once Nafcillin was D/c'd and labs started to trend down. She was
also found to have increase in Lipase of 79  and amylase of 113
on [**7-16**] . This was believed to be caused by mild pancreatitis
also related to prior treatment administration of Nafcillin. She
will have continue monitoring of LFTs, including lipase and
amylase weekly. She was doing well at discharge, tolerating her
regular diet with no complains of N/V or abdominal pain.

.
#UTI: Urine culture Positive for E.Coli > 100,000 colonies,
rresistant to cipro and ampicillin. Sensitive to the
cefalosporins, zozyn, tobramycin, Bactrim, and Nitrofurantoin.
Received 3 days of Bactrim. D/c on [**7-11**]. Repeat UA on [**7-11**].
Urine culture on [**7-11**] shows no growth.
.
#Tachycardia: Patient has been sinus tachycardic for most of her
admission. EKG remained unchanged, she was placed on tele for
the first few day of admission where she remained on sinus tachy
in rates ranging from 90s to low 100s, asymptomatic. This could
be due to mild hyperthyroidism, TSH low 0.08 and on
levothryroxine. Patient also given extra fluid bolus which she
responded well, so could also be due to dehydration. Patient
stable at time of discharge. Follow TSH and T4 as outpaint
encourage PO fluids.
.
# 2nd degree right buttock ulcer: Patient with small 2x1 cm in
diameter excoriation on right buttock. The wound care nurse
assessed and treated the wound. The wound has overall improved,
now there is only very small wound healing well less than .5cm
in diameter at the time of discharge with dressing over it.
.
#Coronary Artery Disease: No changes on EKG.
- continue aspirin 81 mg daily
.
At discharge: Patient is alert and oriented times place and
time. She respond appropriately to questions, and conversing.
Very pleasant. She moves in bed with minimal assist. She is
incontinent of urine and stool which is her baseline. She is
stable and medically clear to go back to her extended care
facility.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo F with multiple sclerosis, [**Month/Day/Year 45870**] [**Month/Day/Year **] s/p
appendicovesiculostomy presents from home with fevers without
any other localizing symptoms and UTI monitored overnight for
systolic blood pressures in 90s without event.

#. Complicated UTI - Draining clear urine from
appendicovesiculostomy. Discussed with urology use and function,
OK to leave in place and change under sterile conditions
intermittently. No prior resistent culture data in our system.
E.coli and serratia in past, most recent [**8-27**]. Is not at high
risk for resistant organisms as lives at home, rarely admitted.
Receive levo/cefepime in ED. No evidence of pyelonephritis based
on clinic presentation/exam.
- switched to po ciprofloxacin 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 day course from
Day#1= [**3-6**] on admission
- urine culture enterobacter, sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
.
# Borderline Blood Pressures - Baseline per pt/husband BP
90s/50s. [**Name2 (NI) **] is in bed most of the day. Patient has remained
alert, oriented, and maintaining good urine output with SBPs
ranging 80-90s.

Chief Complaint:
fatigue, fever, dysuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71M w/PMHx sig secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,
wheelchair bound, with DM2 on hypoglycemics presented to his PCP
office with 24 hours of fatigue, decreased appetite, and
decreased urination. Pt reported that he normally self-caths q8h
but did not feel the need to do so in the last 24 hours. Reports
that he has had gradually increasing weakness and decreased
ability to transfer himself out of his wheelchair. He reported
nasal congestion, cough, and malaise for several days prior. In
his PCP's office, he was found to have pyuria and a WBC to 24,
and was refered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.0 p 80 bp 104/43 r 20. He was
noted to be resting comfortably, and reported continued penile
discomfort and mild nausea. He was noted to have mild abdominal
tenderness on exam. He was found to have a lactate of 6.3, WBC
26, and creatinine 2.8 (baseline ~1.0) as well as a K 8.5 and
Glucose of 601.
.
He was subsequently given 50meq of bicarb and calcium gluconate
2mg for membrane stabilization, and started on an insulin drip
and given 4L NS, with subsequent decrease of his glucose to 467
and then 215. His potassium decreased to 4.8, but his lactate
remained elevated at 4.9. He received ceftriaxone for his UTI.
He was subsequently noted to have a systolic pressure to 75,
thus a central line was started and he was given empiric
vancomycin and zosyn due to his prior mild abdominal tenderness
on exam. However, a subsequent CT scan did not demonstrate an
acute intraabdominal process. Due to consistently low pressures,
he was started on levophed before transition to the floor.

On arrival to the MICU, his initial vitals were T 95.3, p 81, bp
99/62, r 22, 98% on RA. He stated that he was comfortable but
felt weak and very tired. His saline was switched to D51/2 and
his insulin reduced. An arterial line was placed due to his need
for invasive management and pressor support.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness. Denies shortness of breath or
wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or

CXR: 1. No evidence of acute disease.
2. Soft tissue fullness in the aortopulmonary window, probably
artifactual or post-operative. However, when clinically
appropriate, standard PA and lateral radiographs are recommended
with optimal inspiration in order to reassess when possible
clinically. Correlation with prior radiographs, if available,
could also be helpful.

Ct of the abdomen:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process detected.
Specifically,
there is no abscess. The appendix is not visualized, however, no
secondary
signs of appendicitis are detected.
2. Markedly enlarged prostate.
3. Thickened bladder wall may represent chronic neurogenic
bladder but
superimposed UTI cannot be excluded.
4. Nonspecific mild dilation of both ureters, slightly greater
on the right, with no evidence of renal, ureteral or bladder
calculi, possibly representing chronic obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M w/multiple sclerosis and DM2 presented with urosepsis and
DKA.

# Urosepsis: Pt has long-term MS leading to neurogenic bladder
and a need for constant self-catheterisation and predisposition
for the UTI. Per history patient was catheterizing less
frequently with large quantities due to reduced urge.  He was
briefly septic with elevated lactate and WBC count, and
hypotension requiring pressors in the ICU.  He was initially
started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin and
Zosyn subsequently changed to Vanco, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
 Urine culture eventually gre pansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia.
 He was continued on a 14 day course of ciprofloxacin, last day
[**2173-1-6**].  Pt was educated on methods of reducing risk of UTI
including frequent catheterization using sterile technique.  Pt
should be self catheterizing at minimum three times a day, but
usually more frequently.  No more than 400cc urine should be
kept in the bladder at any given time. Larger quantities of
output suggest patient should be catheterizing more frequently
(4-5 times daily).  He is expected to require some assistance
with catheterization at rehab.

# Diabetes:Although the patient is a type 2 diabetic on oral
hypoglycemics, on presentation he had positive urine ketones and
acidosis with blood glucose in the 600s. Although his glucose
has been moderately well-controlled on his home regimen, his
concurrent sepsis and ensuing inflammatory state may have His
blood glucose has been responsive to insulin ss [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  As
his renal function improved, medical team preferred to resume
oral hypoglycemic agents, which was preferable to patient also.

.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Probably prerenal in origin due to hypotension/urosepsis.
Creatinine was improved at time of discharge was 1.0. Pt was
also noted to have hydroureter suggesting post renal pressure
and that more frequent catheterization may be indicated.

# MS: Pt presents with no acute neurological sequelae. His
weakness is likely due to his hypotension and sepsis. At time of
discharge patient was working with physical therapy, compentent
with transfers on board, (reduced from baseline which is
standing on transfers).  He will require daily physical therapy
for strengthening.

# H/O DVT/PE: Pt was maintained on anticoagulation.  INR was
subtherapeutic at time of discharge (INR 1.6).  Warfarin was
increased to 5mg daily and will likely need close monitoring in
the short term(every other day) until tirated to INR [**1-15**], then
again after discontinuation of ciprofloxain on [**2173-1-6**].

# Depression: Patient seemed to be in low mood with increased
fixation on certain ideas.  For example he was initially very
concerned with the idea of starting insulin and became very
fixated.  Later it was regarding self catheterization.  This was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient had previously been on celexa
and seroquel as outpatient.  They were held on admission, and
continued to be held upon discovery that he had not been
compliant with celexa.  There was concern seroquel would cause
sedation in the acute setting.  Can be restarted when patient at
baseline health.

Pt was full code during his admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 53812**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-1-23**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 **] on [**2104-1-23**] with a right knee wound with
purulent drainage.  He was admitted to the orthopaedic surgical
service.  On [**2104-1-24**] he was taken to the operating room and
underwent an I&D of his right knee wound.  Infectious disease
was consulted for help with infectious management.  He was
placed on IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.  He was also
consulted on by the wound care nurse for help with his skin
breakdown and pressure ulcers.  Urology was consulted for foley
evaluation.  They recommend to continue foley and change every 3
weeks.  Do NOT treat UTI's unless symptomatic.  Suprapubic tube
can be placed if foley placement becomes difficult.  He was also
seen by nutrition to maximize nutritional status due to skin
breakdown.  It was recommended to start Ensure Plus (vanilla)
and to continue to monitor dietary intact as has good appetite.
On [**2104-1-25**] he was noted to be hypotensive and was given 1500 mL
of fluid bolus due to post operative fluid volume deficit and 2
units of packed red blood cells due to acute blood loss anemia.
Medicine was consulted for evaluation.  He spiked a temperature
to 102.2 and was transferred to the MICU as there was concern
for SIRS.  He was started on ceftazidine.  He was given an
additional 2 units of packed red blood cells due to acute blood
loss anemia.  He was transfused back to the floor on [**2104-1-26**].
He was taken to the operating room on [**2104-1-28**] for an AKA.  He
tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, transferred to the
recovery room, and then to the floor.  On the floor he was seen
by physical therapy to improve his strength and mobility.  On
[**2104-1-29**] his ceftazidine was stopped per infectious disease and
he remained on vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.  The remainder of
his hospital course was uneventful and Mr. [**Known lastname 53812**] is being
discharged to home with VNA services for continued antimicrobial
treatment.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 58 yo woman with a history of a Left parietal
IPH in [**2163-3-19**] after presenting with expressive aphasia and
R
arm weakness. There was some concern that the sentinel event was
a seizure so at that time she was started on Keppra 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].
A
CTA showed an AVM with some filling from a Left MCA branch. She
underwent embolization on [**2163-4-15**]. The embolization was
successful, however a left branch MCA clot was noted during the
procedure and was placed on ASA 81mg. She had done well and was
tapered off Keppra.

On [**2162-12-7**] she had told her husband that her right arm felt
weird
like the time when she first presented with the IPH. EMS was
called and she was transported to an OSH. She was verbal at that
time with some R arm weakness and a ""word salad"". A ct of the
head was being completed and a right sided seizure was noted but
still verbal. 500mg of keppra was given along with 2 mg ativan
and then transferred here for further care.

Here she has been non-verbal and not following commands.her eyes
were open and reports from the ED physician is that she
initially
had right eye deviation.

Since the prior study there has been improved aeration of the
right paracentral regions suggesting improved CHF. Residual
features persist. There is some left basilar atelectasis. No new
focal consolidations and no increased distention of the
pulmonary vasculature. Heart size is within normal limits.
.
Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2122-10-22**]
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA with 40% distal stenosis. The LAD was
calcified with 40% midvessel lesion; the diagonal had a 40%
lesion. The LCX had a mid 50% lesion and supplied collaterals to
the right. The RCA had a 90% ostial lesion and there was diffuse
60-70% restenosis through the entire course of the RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial pressures.
3. Distal aortography was performed to ensure that
initial-access guidewire passage did not cause trauma. There was
no sign of perforation or dye extravasation. The common femoral
artery had 50% stenosis.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial rca with a 3.0x18
cypher and a 3.0x8 cypher. Successful PTCA and stenting of the
mid-distal RCA with overlapping 3.0x33 and 2.5x28mm Cypher
stents. Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis in the
stented areas, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI
3 flow.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of RCA.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2122-10-20**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe inferior wall hypokinesis and mild inferolateral wall
hypokinesis. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**12-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2118-2-7**], the wall motion abnormality is new and consistent
with single vessel CAD. The mitral regurgitation is also new.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON Study Date of [**2122-10-19**] 1:06 AM
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2.  Small-to-moderate bilateral simple layering pleural
effusions with
peribronchovascular opacities and septal thickening, most
suggestive of  alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema.
Appropriate treatment and repeat
radiographs is recommended to assess for resolution and exclude
infectious
etiology.
3.  Dense calcifications within the left and right coronary
circulation,
intrathoracic aorta, and aortic root.  Mild LVH and left atrial
enlargement.
4.  Stable small hypoattenuating right thyroid lesion is likely
a benign
nodule and could be further evaluated with a dedicated
ultrasound on a
nonemergent basis if clinically indicated.
5.  Centrilobular emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
Patient is 79 F with multiple sclerosis, admitted with pulmonary
edema and hypotension, found to have NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI and likely resultant CHF/hypotension:
NSTEMI with enzyme bump with failure both clinically and by
radiographic studies. Last assessment of EF by nuclear imaging
in [**2120-7-29**] was nl, though a TTE in [**2117**] did suggest diastolic
dysfunction. Echo on [**2122-10-20**] showed new diastolic dysfunction
with inferior and lateral hypokinesis, and mitral regurgitation.
 Gave aspirin, statin, Plavix and 48 hours of heparin drip.
Initially did not tolerate small doses of Beta blockers due to
hypotension, but did tolerate small dose of Ace-I. Was taken to
cath [**10-22**] where a diffusely diseased RCA was intervened on
w/multiple drug-eluting stents. Her CHF was felt to be
exacerbated by acute diastolic dysfunction in the setting of an
NSTEMI.  Was transferred to the floor for continued diuresis,
which she tolerated well, remaining hemodynamically stable x 48
hours.  Also tolerated low dose Metoprolol of 12.5 mg daily
(previously on 25 mg poi [**Hospital1 **] on admit).  Upon discharge she was
stable and tolerating low dose BB, ACE-I, ASA, statin and
Plavix.  Should have LFTs checked by primary physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**4-3**]
weeks to monitor for elevation given increased statin.
.
#Sacral Decubitus: No fevers at this time, mild leukocytosis on
admit that resolved.
Being followed @ [**Hospital1 336**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for skin flap.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on admission and stated that the drain
and staples should remain in place until she sees him in follow
up. She was to continue on Zosyn as well.  Upon discharge she's
afebrile and without evidence of flap infection, and the wound
is healing well.  Should continue daily dressing changes in an
attempt to keep fecal material out of the drain.  Recommended
she schedule an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] upon discharge.
Should also have sand bed at her facility, which has already
been set-up.
.
# Anemia - Patient with relative anemia since [**Name (NI) 216**] (Hct 35),
it was 28 upon admission, drifted to 23 - she received 2 units
of PRBCs on [**10-22**] with an appropriate bump to 29.5.  Since then
her Hct has been stable and was likely low in the setting of
cardiac catheterization.  Also found to have low Fe, but also
low TIBC.  B12 and folate within normal ranges.   On discharge
Hct was 31 and trending upward.  Should have continued work-up
by her Primary Care, but most likely associated with chronic
disease and transiently lowered with her various procedures and
lab draws.

Service:

This is a dictation update to the dictation dictated on [**12-27**]
for this patient.

At the time of last dictation the patient was appearing well
and heading toward rehab.  However, she had a number of
setbacks since that time.

1.  Respiratory.  After her tracheal stents were put in by
interventional pulmonology, patient continued to have greatly
increased secretions which she was unable to clear.  She
needed consistent, intensive pulmonary toilet and respiratory
therapy with suctioning and nebulizers.  She also stayed in
the MICU for two days for intensive pulmonary therapy.  It
became clear over the ensuing days that patient stents were
causing more problems due to increased secretions and
increased difficulty clearing the secretions, than they were
able to relieve her shortness of breath secondary to
tracheomalacia.  The stents are planned to be removed today,
[**2144-1-15**].  Stent removal was postponed due to GI problems as
summarized below.

2.  GI.  The patient developed nausea and constipation on
[**1-5**].  A KUB was obtained which showed significant fecal
distension to approximately 14 cm with overall colonic
distension.  There was no evidence of physical obstruction.
Based on this x-ray, patient was felt to have colonic
obstruction or a functional ileus secondary to bed rest and
general medical comorbidity.  An NG tube was placed as well
as a rectal tube and she was followed by surgery and GI and
treated conservatively.  Serial KUBs demonstrated no
significant change in colonic distension over the forthcoming
days and colonoscopy/colonic decompression was performed.
This had a mild effect, showing some minor decompression of
the colon.  However, patient did feel symptomatically better.
Of note, patient never complained of any abdominal pain and
although bowel sounds were greatly decreased and abdomen was
distended, there was never felt to be any evidence of an
acute abdomen.  After colonic decompression, a decompression
tube was placed and patient was started on clear liquids.
The NG tube was removed and the rectal tube was removed.
Over the next days patient developed normal bowel movements
after a short course of diarrhea and was able to tolerate a
full liquid diet.  It is felt that patient has a significant
degree of chronic colonic distension.  It is unclear how much
of what is seen currently on the KUB is acute and how much is
chronic, but as long as patient is asymptomatic, passing gas
and having bowel movements and has no nausea, vomiting, we
will treat this as chronic and no further GI intervention
will be done.

3.  Hematology.  The patient has had chronic anemia over the
past weeks with slow drop in hematocrit.  She required
approximately three units of blood over the past two weeks.
She has no evidence of hemolysis and stools became guaiac
positive only when colonic distension ensued and her ileus.
Other than that she has also had bleeding sources from
hemoptysis and a vaginal bleed.  At the time of this
dictation, patient's hematocrit has been stable for the past
few days and she has had no obvious bleeding source.  It is
felt that patient had anemia of chronic disease with
depressed marrow due to her comorbidities and that her blood
loss is due to phlebotomy and small volume blood loss from
hemoptysis, lower GI bleeding and past vaginal bleeding.

4.  GU.  The patient developed vaginal bleed around
approximately [**1-8**].  GYN was consulted and endometrial biopsy
was taken.  This was found to be normal.  On further
inspection it was found that the bleeding was from the
urethra and urology was consulted.  They felt this was most
likely urethritis related to Foley and trauma and the
bleeding was exacerbated by Lovenox.  A followup CT urogram
is planned, but has not been done to date due to other more
acute medical problems.

5.  ID.  The patient's antibiotics have been discontinued.
There are no signs of current infection.

The patient will have stents removed today.  It is unclear
what the nature of her next few days of her hospital course
will be.  However, her disposition is to rehab when stable.
Dictation will be appended with discharge medications when
patient is planned to be discharged.

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

ADDENDUM:  This is a Discharge Summary Addendum.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):  As per the
previous Discharge Summary, the patient was planned to be
discharged to a [**Hospital 2754**] rehabilitation care facility.
However, on the planned day of discharge the patient
developed hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation
and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The respiratory failure was thought to be due to an
aspiration event or mucous plugging.  The patient was also
started on pressors briefly for mild hypotension at that
time.  The patient's antibiotic coverage was changed to
linezolid, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for double coverage of
possible Pseudomonas pneumonia.  The patient had improvement
the day following transfer to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, and the linezolid was discontinued after two days.  The
cefepime and ciprofloxacin were continued.

The patient was then transferred from the Medical Intensive
Care Unit back to the regular floor.  On the same day after
her transfer, the patient once again developed hypoxic
respiratory failure; again thought to be due to an aspiration
event.  This time the patient was not initially intubated but
was first placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.  The
patient did not require intubation during this Medical
Intensive Care Unit stay.  The patient had rapid recovery to
her previous baseline and was weaned off the [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure.  The acute hypoxic event was
thought to be due to mucous plugging.  The patient was
continued on her previous antibiotics of cefepime and
ciprofloxacin.  The patient was placed on a regimen of
q.2-3h. suctioning to prevent repeat mucous plugging and
aspiration.

As the patient was at a high risk for aspiration, she was
kept nothing by mouth and started on tube feeds via a
nasogastric tube.  The patient tolerated this well.

She was then transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit
back to the floor.  Initially on the floor, she was
oxygenating well on room air and was stable.

After one to two days on the floor, the patient had increased
oxygen requirements on room air and was placed on a face
mask.  It was unclear if this was due to a recurrent
aspiration event; although, the patient was witnessed to be
coughing prior to this decrease in her oxygen saturations.
She did remain stable and was oxygenating well on the face
mask.

With regard to her feedings, Gastroenterology was consulted.
A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed, and
tube feeds were restarted through this percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was also noted
to have a gradually decreasing hematocrit; however, there was
no evidence of bleeding.  Her hematocrit eventually
stabilized without any further intervention.

The patient was also hyponatremic with sodium levels in the
mid 120s.  A workup showed that the urine was inappropriately
concentrated, suggesting possible syndrome of inappropriate
secretion of antidiuretic hormone as the etiology of her
hyponatremia.  The patient was placed on a fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters per day.  On this, her sodium was stable at
approximately 128.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to an
extended care rehabilitation facility.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition.
She was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and requiring
oxygen by face mask.  She was tolerating tube feeds well.
Her mental status was that of baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End-stage multiple sclerosis.
2.  Aspiration pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth q.12h. (to be continued for
a total of 14 days).
2.  Cefepime 1 gram intravenously q.12h. (to be continued for
a total of 14 days).
3.  Prevacid 30 mg once per day.
4.  Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day.
5.  Multivitamin one tablet once per day.
6.   .................... 220 mg once per day.
7.  Colace.
8.  Senna.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient will require supportive care for decubitus
ulcers on the back and the extremities.  She will require
daily dressing changes as had been done in the hospital.
2.  The patient will also require aggressive pulmonary toilet
with frequent suctioning to prevent recurrent aspiration and
mucous plugging.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary
care provider.

dressed in towels and drying to dress self with plastic bags.
Shortly prior to her daughter arriving home, other family
members
(who live above and below her) had heard a variety of banging
noises coming from the pt's apt, but thought it might have been
the daughter coming home. The daughter found behaving very
bizarrely, not following commands, and was becoming agitated and
beligerent. She was brought to the ER where she was noted to be
very agitated and uncooperative with examination. She was given
ativan and haldol. At one point she became very somnolent with
shallow breathing, but as [**Name8 (MD) **] RN tried to apply face mask, she
resisted and stated she didn't need it. She also had an episode
where she was repeatedly sitting up and down in bed and was
breathing in a staccato manner. Over the course of several hours
she was given a total of 8 mg ativan and 15 mg haldol. She was
also given ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir to cover for
meningitis. She also received 100 mg hydrocortisone in case of
adrenal insufficiency [**2-1**] her recent solumedrol infusions.
Finally she received 1000 mg Dilantin. Family states that
nothing
like this has happened before. She has not been ill otherwise,
and there have been no new meds added to her regimen recently.

MRI of the brain
In comparison with the prior examination dated [**2176-3-27**],
there is no
evidence of new lesions, persistent areas of hyperintensity
signal in the
subcortical and periventricular white matter and also in the
reflection of the callosal septal region likely consistent with
areas of demyelination and possibly representing lesions related
with multiple sclerosis. There is no evidence of abnormal
enhancement or new lesions. No diffusion abnormalities are
detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo RHW with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, recently
discharged from hospital after a 5 day course of IV solumedrol
presents with bizarre, and uncharacteristic behavior. Her family
mentioned that she is prone to agitation in the hospital
setting, which is exacerbated with benzodiazepines. Family
discussion with [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 17113**] health care proxy and mother,
[**Name (NI) 110032**] [**Name (NI) **] indicated that she was unclear regarding the
necessity for intubation and the lumbar puncture. As
evidenced from Dr[**Name (NI) 110033**] note from yesterday, Ms [**Known lastname 17113**]
bizarre behavior continued in the ER, and it was felt that she
was having seizures. In the ER when she received Dilantin, she
became hypotensive. She was then intubated in the ER.

According to the patient's daughter, her mother kept wanting to
go to the bathroom, rubbing her legs in the ER and not making
much sense. Prior to the ER incident, when her daughter returned
from college late at night, she found her mother in an
uncharacteristic mess or paraphernalia, which was
uncharacteristic of her, in addition, she had not gone to bed,
which she normally does. The patient's mother had described loud
banging noises in her daughter's portion of the family house
which is the [**Location (un) 1773**]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] note from [**2179-2-28**]
described the patient as having a pervasive sleep disorder for
which she used baclofen and vicodin as Mirapex had not been
useful for her.

In the neuro ICU service she was maintained on droplet
precautions due to the concern of a viral encephalitis. She was
switched from Midazolam to Propofol, due to her issue of
agitation on benzodiazepines, which may have posed a problem
while attempting to wean her.

On [**2179-5-6**] she was extubated. After extubation, despite attempts
to convince her to stay in hospital, she self-discharged herself
from hospital. She was found to be competent (please refer to Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] note in OMR).

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-12-23**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrates three vessel coronary disease.
There is an 80% lesion in the distal left main coronary artery.
The circumflex artery is proxmally occluded and the obtuse
marginals are filled by collaterals from the right. The left
anterior descending is involved, with ostial diagonal and ramus
lesions of 70% and proximal LAD lesion of 40%. The right
coronary arteyr contains an 80% lesion in the proximal posterior
descending. There is a 50% lesion in the distal right coronary
artery. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrate normal blood
pressure.

[**2155-12-24**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40%
stenosis

[**2155-12-26**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated and displays mild to moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is a
suggestion of a possible fibroelastoma on the left or
non-coronary cusp but it can not be definitively determined. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is now normal
biventricular systolic function. Valvular function is
essentially unchanged. A left pleural effusion is noted. The
thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20622**] was admitted following his cardiac cath which revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. He was worked up
for bypass surgery. While awaiting Plavix wash-out he was
medically managed. On [**12-26**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical
but stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He weaned
off pressor support and Beta-blocker/aspirin/statin and diuresis
were initiated. He was transfused with blood products
postoperatively for coagulopathy and anemia likely due to blood
loss and volume resucitation. POD#1 A right pneumothorax was
evident on CXR. A thoracosotomy tube was inserted and remained
in until pneumothorax resolved. All tubes and drains were
discontinued per protocol. Anticoagulation was resumed for his
chronic atrial fibrillation. He remained in CVICU until POD#3
for aggressive pulmonary hygiene. He was slow to progress but
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. The remainder of his hospital course was essentially
uneventful. On POD#6 he was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital1 12004**]. All follow up appointments were advised.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old female with PMH significant for multiple
sclerosis presents with abdominal pain x 5 days, along with SOB.
 Describes having constant epigastric pain that is burning in
nature and worsened with eating; however somewhat better with
milk. The pain is non-positional in nature and is not
exacerbated by recumbency. States that spicy food exacerbates
her pain.  Reports some associated nausea but no vomiting and
also reports constipation.  In addition, the patient has had
increasing dysphagia for both solids and liquids the last few
months, a video swallow study in [**6-7**] was largely unremarkable.
Denies recent weight loss and reports a good appetite.

Pt also reports feeling increasingly shortness of breath over
the past 3-4 months.  As she is wheelchair bound, she can't say
for sure that this is exertional. Denies PND, orthopnea, h/o LE
edema. Feels that her SOB is worse when she experiences
swallowing difficulty. Denies chest pain, dizziness, fevers,
chills, night sweats. Does report a non-productive cough that is
chronic in nature but has increased in frequency in the past few
weeks.

CXR - 1.  No free intraperitoneal air.
2.  4-cm mass within the right upper lung zone.  Further
evaluation of this with a CT scan should be obtained.
.
Chest CT - 1.  Approximately 3.7 x 2.4 cm noncalcified,
noncavitating enhancing mass in right upper lobe abutting the
right side of the mediastinum, with possible area of assocaited
post- obstructive subsegmental atelectasis. There is no
pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
These findings are concerning for a primary bronchogenic
carcinoma that may be accessible to
tiisue diagnosis by transbronchial biopsy. 2.  4-mm nonspecific
noncalcified subpleural nodule within the right lower lobe.
Second possible smaller nodule in the right lower lobe. 3.  Tiny
hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is too small to
characterize.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F c multiple sclerosis, chronic LBP, initially presents
with hypercarbic respiratory distress, then intubated, trached
and found to have NSCLC.
.
# Lung cancer - Biopsy of the right upper lobe mass result came
back as nonsmall cell lung cancer and it is Stage III by mass
size. Oncology saw patient while in house. No treatment will be
offered given her prognosis and co-morbidity. Her husband had
refused to talk to oncology as inpatient. No staging had been
done due to husband's refusal to talk about her cancer. She will
be followed by oncology as outpatient as necessary for possible
palliative treamtment in the future.
.
# Respiratory failure-Patient initiailly presents with
hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration due to multiple
sclerosis. SHe was eventually intubated. Weaning had been
unsuccessful due mostly to muscles weakness from multiple
sclerosis. She had tracheostomy while in ICU. SHe will require
long term ventilatory support since her multiple sclerosis is
progressive. She is on pressure support on discharge. Her trach
had been downsized to size 7 prior to discharge to faciliate
ventilator assisted speech. She does have a lot of anxiety,
needs ativan prn and needs reassurance and training with speech
and swallow.
.
# Dysphagia/aspiration - Patient has significant aspiration per
studies by speech and swallow. However, patient is very eager to
eat. GIven her bad prognosis from her lung cancer and multiple
sclerosis, she needs to be evaluated by speech and swallow
again. If she insists on eating, she needs to understand the
aspiration riskk and the potential mortality from that.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Per most recent [**Month/Day (1) **] note, pt with
progressive cognitive decline requiring assitance with most
ADLs. [**Month/Day (1) 878**] recommended to discontinue Avonex treatment
given no clear benefit. Continue supportive management.
.
# urinary tract infection
She was found to have enterobacter UTI and was started on
bactrim to complete 7 days course(d1= [**11-17**])
.
# Chronic LBP - Currently stable. Continue lidoderm patch.
.
# Code - Full, confirmed with pt and husband.

FURTHER HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was not discharged on
[**2150-4-15**] because her white blood count was slightly increased.
The patient had a repeat abdominal CT scan here on [**4-16**] to
evaluate the possible right liver mass noted on right upper
quadrant ultrasound and right kidney lesion, in order to rule
out abscess or other perinephric fluid collection.  The
patient's abdominal CT scan showed:

1. Bilateral staghorn calculi measuring 2.5 cm on the right
and 2.7 cm on the left, without evidence of hydronephrosis or
perirenal abscess.

She had a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube in place.

2. Focal fatty infiltration of within the right lobe of the
liver adjacent to the falciform ligament.

3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

4. No masses were identified within either kidney.

The patient also had repeat blood cultures that were ""no
growth.""  She also had a C. difficile assay sent to rule out
C. difficile colitis as the cause of her persistent elevation
of her white blood cell count.  All of these tests were
negative.  Because of the staghorn calculi now present on the
left, and the persistent elevated white blood cell count,
Urology was consulted and recommended a percutaneous
nephrostomy tube to be placed in the left kidney.  This was
done by interventional radiology on [**2150-4-16**].  Initially the
tube did not drain well, but after flushing, the tube began
to drain clear urine.  Post-procedure, the patient did have
hematuria in the ileal conduit bag, and some minimal
hematuria in the left nephrostomy tube.  This was likely
secondary to the procedure, and cleared mostly prior to
discharge.  The last nephrostomy bag still had some faint
pink tinge to the otherwise clear urine.

The patient should continue her ceftazidime for the full two
week course, with the last day being [**2150-4-29**] at minimum.  At
the time of discharge, her white blood count was still 19.
It was felt that this was likely a reaction to the persistent
stones in her kidneys.  It was expected that her white blood
count should continue to improve minimally, and would improve
significantly after stone extraction by Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**].  The
patient was to call Dr. [**Name (NI) 10259**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10260**] prior to
discontinuing the antibiotics, to arrange for the removal of
her staghorn calculi on or near [**2150-4-29**].

If the patient spikes or if the nursing home has any
difficulty with the nephrostomy tube, they were advised that
they should call Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**].  Dr. [**Name (NI) 10259**] was
[**Name (NI) 178**] prior to the patient leaving the hospital, and he
will also follow up in terms of removing the staghorn
calculi.  It was expressed to Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**] that the team
had some concern about the resistance pattern of Mrs.[**Hospital 10261**]
proteus and pseudomonas, and the need for more urgent stone
removal if possible.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Proteus and Pseudomonas urosepsis.
2. Bilateral staghorn calculi complicated by right
hydronephrosis.
3. Status post bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient's white blood cell
count is turning down.  The patient was afebrile, and was
tolerating a p.o. diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To extended care facility, [**Hospital3 10262**]
Home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient should follow up with her
urologist, Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**], after discharge.  He will arrange
for endoscopic stone removal of her bilateral staghorn
calculi. Dr. [**Doctor Last Name 10259**] was [**Name (NI) 178**], and the patient was
also aware that she needs to call him.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
1. Post placement of right and left nephrostomy tubes.

1. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q day.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day.

Discharge Instructions:
You have a history of multiple sclerosis, left parietal stroke
in [**2129-8-16**], and history of atrial fibrillation, and you
were admitted with weakness and numbness in your left leg.  On
day of admission, you required brief ICU admission for rate
control for atrial fibrillation. The next day you were
transferred to the neurology [**Hospital1 **] for further care.  Your
admission blood cultures were found to grow bacteria and your
admission urine culture revealed that you had a urinary tract
infection.  Therefore, you were started on the antibiotic called
vancomycin.  The infectious disease service was involved in your
care. The plan is to transfer you back to your rehab facility
with a PICC line so that you can complete the 14 day course of
the antibiotic, vancomycin.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
1. Anaphylactoid reaction
2. Epinephrine overdose.
3. Acute lung injury.
4. Acute cardiac injury.
5. Acute dystonic reaction and trismus (lock jaw)
6. Left hip/back pain, possibly due to a herniated disc
7. Multiple sclerosis flare.


Discharge Condition:
Heart and lung exams have returned to [**Location 1867**].  Face, jaw, and
hand spasms, resulting from an adverse reaction to compazine,
have resolved.  You are being discharged in stable condition,
but need close follow-up as an outpatient to ensure full
recovery from your complex hospital course.


Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated in the Emergency Department for left-sided
flank pain. You had an abdominal CT scan to evaluate this pain,
and had a severe allergic ""anaphylactoid"" reaction to the
intravenous contrast used for the CT.  You were given a high
dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids, famotadine, benadryl,
and intravenous fluids for treatment of this reaction. The
severe allergic reaction and high dose of epinephrine resulted
in injury to your heart and lungs. You were admitted and treated

for this reaction in the Intensive Care Unit for 2 days, and
once stable, transferred to the medicine floor.

You also developed a facial contortion and locked jaw (a
dystonic reaction) in response to a medication you took for
nausea, called Compazine.  This resolved initially with
medications, except your jaw remained locked for 4 days. You
recieved benadryl, benztropine (Cogentin), and Valium.  Higher
doses of valium in addition to manual manipulation of your jaw
was required to finally open the jaw.

You developed symptoms of right foot inversion, right hand
clumsiness, and right eye ""blurring"".  An MRI of your head was
consistent with an active multiple sclerosis flare.  You were
treated with high-dose steroids for three days, with mild
improvement.

Please remain at home for 1 week following discharge for further

monitoring, given the recent complicated hospital course
involving anaphylactic reaction, myocardial injury, acute lung
injury, and acute dystonic reaction.

Your back pain is likely from a bulging disc in your spine. You
can treat this with pain medication for now, and if it does not
resolve in [**1-17**] weeks, please see your primary care physician to
follow it up.

Please note that you are allergic to IV contrast, and had a
dystonic reaction to Compazine. These have been added to your
allergy list.

Please return to the ED or call your primary care physician if
you have symptoms similar to those you had in the CT scanner -
throat tightness, ichiness, or any other concerning symptoms.
Please do the same if your jaw locks again.


Followup Instructions:
You have been scheduled for Tysabri infusion at the pheresis
unit on at Monday [**2107-12-12**] at 2:15 PM.  If you have any further
questions, please contact your neurologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9072**],
at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9073**] to schedule Tysabri infusion.

Please f/u with your PCP in the next 2-3 weeks regarding the
back pain.

Please call Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7492**] (Oral Maxillofacial Surgery) to arrange
an appointment for further evaluation of your jaw.

Addendum:
#Renal Insuficiency addendum: Pt Cr=1.5 on admission. Cr then
trended down to 0.7-1.1 after surgery and fluid hydration. Cr
then trended  back up gradualy to 1.3 on the last few days of
hospitalization. Unclear etiology: pre-renal vs. nafcillin
nephrotoxocity vs underlying renal insuficiency. Cr should be
carefully monitored outpatient. Should be checked in 2 days and
then again 1 week after. Continue to trend Cr outpatient. If
continues to be elevated, should get a workup. Has liver
dysfunction with low albumin and elevated INR, however her
fluctuating Cr is unlikely consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.

**Rehab and Primary care physician:
[**Name10 (NameIs) 11227**] check Cr in 2 days
-re-check Cr 7 days after
-continue to monitor Cr outpatient, might need workup.

Addendum:
Anticipated discharge on [**5-2**] home with VNA did not occur given
that VNA did not feel patient was a safe candidate to receive IV
antibiotics at home.  Patient was thus screened for rehab and
accepted but patient refused to go to rehab.  Therefore, despite
being medically stable for discharge, she stayed in the hospital
until [**5-13**].

Previous discharge summary encompassed course from [**4-29**] until
[**5-2**].

Following issues were addressed from [**5-2**] to [**5-13**].
ID: Patient was maintained on vancomycin/zosyn for 14 day
course. All blood cultures ultimately returned negative. She
remained afebrile and largely clinically unchanged. On [**5-10**] she
complained of left jaw pain, the site of her former
osteomyelitis in [**2191-8-2**].  CT of facial bones was obtained
and compared with last prior CT done at [**Hospital6 **] from
[**11-4**].  Staff radiologist noted there were no significant
changes on CT done here [**5-10**] from previous CT of [**11-4**].

Fall: Patient fell on attempt at transfer to her scooter on [**5-11**].
 She did not complain of any significant pain but she did hit
her left foot in the fall.   Left foot films were obtained and
showed possible small fifth phalanx fracture on one view but not
seen on other view.  Clinically, no point tenderness. Therefore,
no intervention at this time.  If clinical change, should have
repeat imaging.

Multiple Sclerosis: Continued on her previous regimen,
maintained on alendronate and ISS given her steroids.  Over
course of admission, staff concerned that patient may have mild
executive dysfunction.  Although no significant neurologic
change, subtle aspects of executive dysfunction noted.  Patient
competent.
Recommend follow-up with outpatient neurologist.

Extensive discussions with patients involving physicians, case
managers, nursing, social work regarding patient's desired goals
of care/autonomy, consideration of nursing home in future, needs
for home care etc.  At this time patient wishes to maintain as
much autonomy as possible and is satisfied with current level of
home assistance. She will consider possibility of nursing home
in the future.

Patient is full code.  Discharged with VNA, home services.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


Pertinent Results:
[**5-10**] facial CT: INDICATION: 49-year-old woman with MRSA,
Pseudomonas urosepsis, history of
right jaw osteomyelitis, now complaining of left-sided jaw pain,
evaluate for
osteomyelitis or bony destruction.

TECHNIQUE: Coronal images were obtained through the paranasal
sinuses and
extending into the temporomandibular joint.

FINDINGS: There is irregularity of the left mandibular condyle,
with
sclerosis, some cortical destruction and flattening of the
superior aspect.
Lucencies are present adjacent to the cortex and in the proximal
aspect of the
condyle. There is no evidence of temporomandibular subluxation
nor
dislocation. Irregularity is also associated to the temporal
articulating
surface of the joint with some thinning of the bony cortex but
no definite
areas of destruction identified. These findings were not
visualized on prior
head CT scan from [**2190-8-6**], axial images partly viewed the
joints. No
abscesses are identified. Findigs may be compatible with The
presence of
osteomyelitis or severe degenerative change.

Minimal mucosal thickening is seen involving the left maxillary
sinus with a
small polyp versus mucous-retention cyst. Remaining paranasal
sinuses are
clear. Nasal septum is in a midline position. Ostiomeatal
complexes are
patent bilaterally. Cribriform plates are symmetric and normal
in appearance.
Anterior clinoids are not pneumatized.

INTERPRETATION: Lucency and irregularity involving the cortex of
the left
mandibular condyle with flattening but no subluxation. There is
also
irregularity involving the articulating surface of the left
temporal aspect of
the joint. Findings may be compatible with osteomyelitis or
severe
degenerative change. Findings were discussed with the physician
caring for
the patient at the time this report was issued.
